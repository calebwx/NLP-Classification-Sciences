16,iez0m9,Electric discharge,"Can electric discharge also occur from a positively charged object?

In the case of negatively charged object, electric field lines point towards the object, meaning that electrons want to go away from the object; a strong electric field will cause electrons to sort of escape, ionize the air, and discharge occurs.

But if an object is positively charged, field lines point away from the object, so electrons tend to stick to the object more, I believe. So, even if the electric field becomes very strong, won't the electrons tend to stick more to the object, meaning that discharge will not occur?

To summarize, does electric discharge occur regardless of the direction of the field line? (Assuming it is only the electrons that can move from the object).

*Inquiry: How to restart studying Physics.*   
*Age: 30.*  
*Location: Singapore.*  
*Education: LLB and LLM (Woeful at maths).*

Hi not sure where I should have raised this topic but thought this Reddit might be appropriate;

So I am currently about to hit 30 and life is thankfully good - great job, good relationship etc.   
However, one regret I have always had was never pursuing my interest in physics. I excelled at the subject during secondary school (age 13-15; Commonwealth Education system) but my maths has always been woeful. 

I have been thinking of relearning Physics (and maths) at a basic level and working my way up. Studying/reading/mugging has never been an issue - whilst I did forgo the Sciences, I opted for Law and have finished my LLB and LLM. 

I was hoping someone here could provide me with some direction of a where to start learning about physics again. Once I get the basic(s) back I might consider night classes etc.

(magnetism, LRC circuits, EM waves) What should I do to improve?","I recently took a Physics midterm concerning topics like magnetism, LRC circuits, and electromagnetic waves, and I didn't get completely destroyed, but I felt as if I should've done better. I studied plenty, I read the textbook plenty of times to understand the material and it's corresponding diagrams. I normally go to lecture and then read the textbook directly afterwards to fill in the gaps, and I usually understand most of the homework problems that are assigned. However, when the midterm comes up, the problems are so difficult that I have trouble finding a way to start. Now, I know I attend a fast-paced, difficult university (UCLA), but I can feel confident about an exam and then when I look at the problems I blank. This midterm, I was given 24 hours to do it with any resource except communication between classmates and other tutors, so it's not like it was testing anxiety. It's just that the problems are always so twisted in a way where you know the general concept it is trying to test, but not really how to go about it. For example, one of the problems asked to verify that Maxwell's equations satisfied the general wavepacket equations for the electric and magnetic fields of an EM wave polarized in a certain direction.

Too long ago now so I wondered if anyone had any thoughts. 

The problem is with the shape and force distribution through a mechanical system- the gib strip in the cross slide of my lathe. This is a deceptively simple system and pretty common in machinery design but subtle problems lead to poor performance - ideally the lathe cross slide should be free of play to at least 0.05mm. 

When properly set-up I know this system can achieve that but currently mine is failing an allowing torsional movement resulting in blade movement during cutting and chatter. 

I am seeking information on the specific forces and vectors going from the set screws through the gib and how the cross sectional shape of the gib, fit, shape and design of the set screw system contribute to the effectiveness of the mechanism. Any insight would be great and would help me modify the system to make it work better.

Here is a video of the problem: [https://youtu.be/rRsx2OqtdrI](https://youtu.be/rRsx2OqtdrI)

And here is a document outlining the issues of gib design and the problem in a little more detail. 

[https://docdro.id/IBnrlV2](https://docdro.id/IBnrlV2)

Background:

The sliding dovetails in many machinery systems are often manufactured with the female component made oversize and some kind of strip of metal used to fill in the gap. This is called a gib. The strip sits in the space and is compressed onto the male dovetail using set screws. The screws are tightened until there is no lateral play in the system but the dovetail is still able to slide (ie friction between the gib and the male dovetail does not prevent the movement). 

There are a few reasons for using gibs, rather than just a tight dovetail. These are:

\-  Less taxing manufacture tolerances

\-  Ability to accommodate wear in the surfaces and improve longevity of the system",2,2020-08-22 01:59:22,physics

50,ie575k,Wacky physics theory from a non-physicist," I've had a theory for some time now that I simply don't have the depth of knowledge to know whether it's even remotely plausible.

I've long been skeptical of the existence of dark matter. For solving the problem of ""missing matter"" in the universe, dark matter seems like a cop-out instead of a real solution.  
In a nutshell, my theory is that the density of matter itself is infinitely variable. This would hinge on the notion of the fundamental building blocks of matter being points without actual dimensions and the dimensions we know and understand being entirely based on the distance between said points, which is entirely relative to the forces present.  
To greatly simplify the whole concept, imagine you build ""atomic structures"". To model atoms, you use exercise balls. Each exercise ball is filled with smaller inflatable balls. From the exercise balls you build a giant ""person"", say 1000 feet tall. With each step, the ""person"" travels approximately 500 feet.  
Now, take that ""person"" to the bottom of the ocean. What happens? It shrinks. It wouldn't ""know"" it's smaller, because everything around it is made up of the same stuff and would shrink proportionally. For the sake of argument, assume it's 1/100th the size.  
Now consider you have a second ""ball person"" directly above on the surface. To walk 100 feet in surface units, it would have to take two steps. The distance between the same two points projected to the ocean floor would be 100x the distance for the ""person"" there, since it's 1/100th the size. That also means you can fit 100x the matter in the same space (when considered as the same area projecting lines down from the surface).  
Relating to black holes, the theory suggests that they don't ""crush"" anything with the extreme gravity, but instead the reason nothing seems to ""escape"" is because the extreme gravity would render matter so small relative to ""normal"" gravity that the distance across the black hole is so great that it takes an extremely long time for anything to cross (including light). For reference, imagine you send three people to traverse a room. Two walk around the edge and make it in a few seconds. For the third, you somehow shrink him to half his size with every step. For that guy, it would take such an extreme length of time for him to traverse the room that you likely would never see him arrive on the other side.

Effectively speaking, if your size reduced proportionally as you approached a location, the distance to that point would be much larger relative to you than if you had crossed between the same points projected to a location parallel to that location - where you weren't subject to the same ""shrinking"" (away from the extreme gravity). If everything around you change size relative to gravity as well, nothing would seem any different to you.

For the ""missing matter"" issue, this would effectively mean that there's a LOT more space than has been accounted for, which could be where the missing matter is ""hiding"".

Please forgive the non-technical description. It's about the best way I can think of to translate the abstract concept I have in my head to something I could put on paper in a context that makes sense.

The biggest issue I can think of is that I can't figure out how you would measure something like this when everything would change size proportionately, including any sort of measuring instruments. One thing I've considered is somehow recreating the ""room"" scenario mentioned above, where you send multiple object across an area of high gravity and measure to see if there's a difference in time to traverse relative to the force of gravity.

I did physics because I wanted to learn the ins and outs of the world around me and be able to solve problems in the real world using mathematics as a tool. The problem is I want to be an inventor, and that involves making things and designing things, pretty much the whole creative process of bringing a product into real life. 

My dilemma is, I've always wanted to do engineering after physics, but there is absolutely no way I want to do it through university, I very highly dislike university and the whole construct of it, my marks aren't the issue its just that it lacks everything I want, I always learnt hands on with physical stimuli and was offered no avenues to explore that, I had to come up with my own ways to teach myself.

Now recently (I am in Australia btw) a trade position in engineering has come up which is an apprenticeship, cert 3 engineering fabrication/machining, its appealing to me because it has every element of what I want to learn, I want to learn how to machine things, design parts and fix machinery, I think ultimately that's what a physicist should be able to do, I should be able to design my own equipment to conduct my own experiments and perform measurements, but we were offered none of that education, in terms of design anyway.  Yes theoretically I can do these things, but its a whole different world in the physical realm. 

Another idea I had was to take a year off, continue working in my small job and take classes in all of these things I want to learn, and continue building my skills, I've saved enough to survive for a year without a ""real"" job, and maybe I can learn these things in this time. 

So my question is, is there a way for me to learn engineering and get some form of qualification and recognition without going to university? I understand inventing is not a real job, but I want my ""real"" job to give me more education that will help me make that dream real. I dont know of any jobs that I can get with my degree out of uni that can give me that form of growth, where I learn to make things and theoretically design things as well.

Four years ago during my undergraduate degree I asked what jobs are available to a physics graduate (see original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/4r3wqb/specific\_physics\_graduate\_career\_opportunities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/4r3wqb/specific_physics_graduate_career_opportunities/)). 

The information provided about what many of you do for a living following from your undergraduate studies was very interesting, and more importantly, very useful in highlighting jobs and roles that I may have otherwise never have known about or considered. Following my undergraduate degree I worked in a graduate role training as a patent attorney before returning to university to begin my PhD. 

I would now like to ask the same question that I asked four years ago, but this time focusing on the opportunities available to physicists who hold PhD's. 

I would like to know what jobs you hold (whether academic or in industry, finance etc.), how you found out about the role, what if any additional training did you do for the role, what you may expect in terms of  career/salary progression in your field, and finally your personal thoughts about the roles you hold. 

I hope that this post will help inform people who are currently doing or who have recently finished a PhD in physics understand what options are available to them in the world of work.

78,idw256,Question for all physicists (in particular astrophysicists)! How much could someone slow down their own time relative to those on earth? Could this be used to advance scientific knowledge for the general population on earth?,"I watched interstellar last night and with a very basic understanding of physics started looking into relativity, with it being integral to the story of the film. 

My question is this: 

If 

a) time relative to people on earth slows as someone else approaches light speed

Yet b) Earth is also travelling at considerable speed through the universe

Could you theoretically:
... send a bunch of scientists somewhere in the universe so that they are not travelling anywhere near the speed earth is relatively to themselves
...have them dedicate their lives to researching and perhaps start a scientific colony
...return to earth with their life-long work, which through relativity would have happened a lot faster than it did on earth, although the scientists would have aged massively compared to those the same age when they left
...rinse and repeat to receive huge scientific advancements in a short amount of time relative to the general population of earth?

Again apologies if this theory completely abuses the laws of physics, in general I am asking how much you could effectively slow down your own time relative to time on earth, as opposed to speed it up with speeds approaching light speed. Thank you!",7,2020-08-21 07:46:52,physics

However, since light travels at a velocity &lt;c when it’s traveling through matter such as a gas or any other transparent or translucent material, it’s experience of time is not instantaneous.

You have been so supportive and said so many kind things about my work. I cannot believe that thousands and thousands of students many be using my apps this year. Helping people learn science is my mission in life!

**Privacy on whscience.org** At first, my website did no tracking whatsoever. I recently add basic analytics from [plausibility](https://plausible.io/). This allows me to get a basic sense of how much people are using each app but does not tracking on an individual level and does not use cookies. I think this is a good way to help me help others but stay sensitive to the fact that many users are minors and privacy for everyone is important. Let me know if you have thoughts about this solution. 

**Now on to the apps**

You can always find all the apps at [whscience.org](https://whscience.org)

Link to all [bio apps](https://whscience.org/biology/) - [chem apps](https://whscience.org/chemistry/) - [earth&amp;space apps](https://whscience.org/earthspace/) - [physics apps](https://whscience.org/physics/)

## Earth and Space Science Apps (NEW)

[Atmosphere](https://whscience.org/atmosphere/) - **Earth&amp;Space** - Simulation of light energy interacting with CO₂ in the atmosphere. Shows light of different wavelengths from the sun and infrared leaving. 

[Gravity Assist](https://whscience.org/gravityassist/) - **Earth&amp;Space** - Students can figure out the conditions for how a spacecraft can use the gravity from a planet to speed up or slow down. 

[ISS Orbit](https://whscience.org/issorbit/) - **Earth/Space** - Change the velocity of the ISS to make it orbit the Earth. Helps with understanding how an orbit works.

[Orbit Examples 1](https://whscience.org/orbits1/) - **Earth&amp;Space** - Shows four orbits around the Earth including low earth, geostationary, and very elliptical. Good for finding patterns in orbits.

[Orbit Examples 2](https://whscience.org/orbits2/) - **Earth&amp;Space** - More examples of orbits. Shows a transfer orbit from a close to a far circular orbit. 

[Planet Energy](https://whscience.org/planetenergy/) - **Earth&amp;Space** - Shows the Earth and Mercury change temperature over time. Mercury is hotter during the day but colder at night. I used this phenomenon to start a unit about climate change. Also available as a version that shows photons entering and leaving the planet: [Planet Energy With Light](https://whscience.org/plantenergywithlight/)

## Chemistry

[Water Temperature](https://whscience.org/watertemperature/) - **Chemistry** - Place a small beaker of water into a larger dish of water. Can control the initial temperatures and volumes. Shows the temperature over time. Can export data as csv.

## Physics

[Motion Graphs](https://whscience.org/motiongraphs/ - **Physics** - Replicates an activity where you move in front of a motion detector and look at the position, velocity, and acceleration graphs. I like to have students try and make interesting graphs and then have others replicate them. 

[Music Waves](https://whscience.org/musicwaves/) - **Physics** - Keyboard that plays sounds and shows the wave on the screen. Can change the audio volume. Sound may not work on some old platforms. White keys only, black keys don't work. 

[Pull Cart](https://whscience.org/pullcart/) - **Physics** - Push or pull on a cart through a spring. The app records force and acceleration and graphs them so students can figure out the mass is the slope. Can export the data as csv. 

---

I'm always adding new stuff so if you are curious check out [whscience.org](https://whscience.org) for the always up to date list. 

I love hearing that the apps are actually being using in the classroom. Let me know what and how you are using them. I am sure there are a bunch of bugs and typos so help me by telling me about them. 

You guys are the best.

111,idhklc,Identity crisis by leaving Physics.," Hello,

I am going to open my heart here because I have been having severe anxiety attacks and I don't know what to do.

I am an international student. My parents are sacrificing so much to pay international tuition + currency exchange rates to allow me to study my passion: Physics. Student loans are not an option for international students, and the international tuition alone is about 3x as expensive as normal tuition.

Since I am coming from the developing world, I thought that scientific careers were viable in developed countries. After 1 year in undergrad and contacting a lot of profs and PhDs as well as looking at numbers on the internet, I realized that I will not have the financial payoff once I graduate. While studying in here, I do not have money to see my family nor my friends (even on Christmas), but I thought this would change after I graduated from undergrad and started a PhD, or maybe even after the PhD.

Once I realized that Physics, specifically the area I wanted to work on (particle physics) has terrible, terrible job outlooks, I have been considering switching to Electrical Engineering to have a better life with less financial trouble. I would also be back at my home country to study this, so no financial burden on my parents and I would be able to see them maybe once a year.

But I am having such an identity crisis. All my life I wanted to be a scientist, to discover the secrets of the universe, to ask fundamental questions. To be honest with myself, it wasn't research that attracted me: I merely wanted to understand the crazy theories. I just wanted to learn. After I realized that academia is idealised and a terrible career and decided to quit while I am still early in it, I started experiencing an identity crisis. I am afraid of being alone because I am afraid of my own thoughts, something that had never happened before. If it keeps up like this, I will end up in depression.

I am also afraid that I will regret my choice to quit, even though logically I know that if I don't quit I will regret it later. It feels like it does not matter what I choose, I will drown in regret.

I just wanted to know if other people had to go through this as well and how you managed to do it.",12,2020-08-20 14:56:32,physics

140,id3s1j,Subway Construction in 4 Dimensions,"**Hey Phys Folx:** I’m trying to do some world-building for a 4D (spatial) universe, and would appreciate some help in working out an urban planning / subway building endeavour faced by one of the main nonbinary trans characters, Yin, a consultant to the 4D United Nations.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SETUP:**

A) Suppose that the centre of one of the most prosperous cities, Chang’an 4D (inspired by the 3D capital of Earth's Tang dynasty), is the densest part of the city, and that the overall population density is given by a 4D derivation of the canonical formula for population density as a function of radius from city centre, as proposed by Clark (1951), ie. an exponentially decaying function:

PD(r) = A\*exp\^(-k\*r) \* 1000, 

where A=1000 (twice that recorded in Paris in 1931) and b=0.2 (New York City in 1940), where r is distance in kilometres and PD is # of sentient beings per km\^2 (including all humans, non-human animals, AI’s, Boltzmann Brains, Vulcans, and Romulans).

B) Suppose then that the 4D UN wants Yin to build the subway in a ‘spider’ pattern, ie. in 2D the superposition of an X and a +. Hence in 2D, 4 subway lines would need to be built. In 3D I counted, and 13 subway lines will need to be built, generalizing from the 2D spider pattern.

C) Suppose finally that the subway is to be a maglev (magnetic levitation) system with \~500 km/h max speeds. Taking for instance the South Shanghai extension to the Shanghai maglev demonstration line, the cost is $18 million USD / km (assuming no cost overruns – a massive assumption in maglev projects). This also assumes that a maglev train would be theoretically possible in 4D, given the different nature of electro-magnetic fields in 4D.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**QUESTIONS:**

\--&gt; In 4D, how many subway lines would need to be built? As a 3D being, I lack any intuition for this…

\--&gt; Assuming the given population density function, can a cost function be derived, for the cost of building all required subway line (within a hyper-spherical radius r), as a function of radius from the city centre, ie. C(r)? Dividing this function by the population density PD at that particular distance r will return the Cost/person, integrated over a 1 km\^3 sphere centred at that distance r.

\[ Unit Analysis: (Cost/km) / (Sentient Beings / km\^4) \]

             = (Cost * km^3 / Sentient Beings) ]

\--&gt; What if the maglev subway system needed to be built in a 5D universe? 6D? 7D? Can general formulas to the above questions be found in n-dimensions?",0,2020-08-19 23:37:29,physics

They said that as far as we know the universe is immortal because it has not been destroyed yet, that we can't say it's impossible for the universe to be immortal because before wings evolved we could say flying is impossible but wings happened and showed flying is possible so the most likely possibility is the universe is immortal so universe is immortal until there is evidence the universe is mortal, and that when we talk about the end of the universe we're just talking about a bunch of hypothesis that can turn out to be false. 

Here are some of the messages of one user in particular; https://imgur.com/7KNF96A 

&gt;the universe is immortal as far as we're aware. It's been here since the beginning of time and hasn't been destroyed yet, and we have no reason to believe that it will ever be destroyed  
&gt;  
&gt;those are just hypothesis . From what we can tell, the universe is immortal until we're proven wrong by it ending  
&gt;  
&gt;until we have evidence that the universe will end, we can conclude that it'll keep doing what it has for 13 billion years - exist   
&gt;  
&gt;We have a sample size of one on the universe. We have evidence that universe exists. We have evidence that the universe hasn't suddenly stopped existing in the past. So we can conclude that the universe won't suddenly stop existing in the future for no reason.   
&gt;  
&gt;We know that life evolves new traits. One of those traits, for instance, is the wing. Previous to the wing's evolution, you could say ""We have no evidence that a living thing can fly""   
&gt;  
&gt;Then something flew, proving that statement wrong. Right now, you're saying ""We have no evidence that the universe can exist forever""

I dont know enough about physics too get an actual answer, but the only thing i could think of was the bat would ripple in a wave effect along too the end of the bat, as the space between atoms wouldnt allow the object too keep pace with the start of the bat. So the bat would just slowly wave too the end before it actually even moved at the end point.

But then i thought about, what if you had an extremely dense baseball bat, where the space between atoms was nonexistent, would at that point, the end of the bat reach a momentum thats faster than the speed of light?

Its a stupidly impossible scenario, but theoretically could it travel faster than light? or is there other universal forces that im not in knowledge of?",11,2020-08-19 06:14:28,physics

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_variables

I believe I got pretty familiar with the ""Period and frequency"" example, there's a lot of good videos about it

But by ""toy examples"" I mean something that doesn't explicitly refer to specific math concepts or real life objects (but all wikipedia examples do both of that)

I also don't need examples based on everyday mechanisms, you can completely make up an nonexistent video game-like mechanism 

You can also give very imperfect examples and just add ""It's a very imperfect example. To make it perfect you should define this and that or add this...""

My ideas for possible (and possibly very imperfect) examples:

**Two clouds.** You have a blue cloud and a red cloud. The more you concentrate one cloud, the more spread the other cloud becomes. *Is it uncertainty relation between positions of two clouds?*

**Aquarium.** You have a fish in a glass box. The more transparent the box becomes, the more visible the fish becomes and vice-versa. *Is it uncertainty relation between visibility of two objects?*

**Multiplying giant.** There's an infinite-size giant. Its position is 100% unknown, but its identity is 100% known. The giant can shrink in size by creating other giants inside itself. The giant can shrink to a single point by creating infinity of other giants inside itself. So its position becomes 100% known, but its identity is 100% unknown. (a really convoluted and bizarre attempt to make an analogy of Fourier transform) ... *Is it uncertainty relation between position and identity?*

**The room and a lamp.** You have a small dimly lighted room. But when you try maximally light up the room it becomes infinite-sized. *Is it uncertainty relation between visibility and position?*

**Two (and more) boxes.** You have boxes with capsules of paint. You can ""ask"" a box to give you one of the capsules or mix all of the capsules. With the 1st box you 100% know the mixed color and have 0% probability to get any certain color in the single capsule. With the 2nd box you 100% know what color will be in the single capsule and have 0% probability to get any certain color after mixing. (you can add more boxes:) With the 1+1/2 box you have 50% probability to guess the color in the single capsule and 50% probability to guess the color of the mix. ... *Is it uncertainty relation between knowledge about color of the single capsule and color of the mix?*

(This is funny and you can go on with examples like this!)

What examples can you give if it's possible?

And if there's a more fitting math concept to those examples, what it is?

204,iciciw,Question regarding conservation of momentum in quantum mechanics,"In a double slit experiment, an electron gun is aimed along the X axis at the double slits in the shield and is emitting the electrons one at a time and at a reasonably slow speed. there is a nonzero probability of detecting the electron at points not on the X axis (i.e. with a Y deflection).  When an electron is detected at such an angle, the electron appears to have acquired momentum in the Y direction.  To conserve the momentum (in the Y direction), something else should get an equal and opposing momentum.  I do not think it could be a photon because those photons would be detectable, and I believe they never were. As the experiment is done in vacuum that leaves only the shield to carry that opposing momentum.  This leads me to the following questions regarding the timing of the shield experiencing this momentum, taking into consideration that it takes time for the electron to move between the shield and the detector.

If the shield experiences the momentum simultaneously with the electron detection, how is this momentum transferred to the shield across the distance separating the detector from the shield? 

Also, if the shield experiences the momentum if and only if the electron is detected implying that there will be no such effect if the electron is not detected. By arranging detectors on only one side of the screen and after many electrons, the shield would experience an accumulation of momentum in one direction and that would be measurable.  I do not think that is an acceptable alternative.
If the shield experiences the momentum exactly when the electron passes through the slits, then the momentum of the electron, and thus its trajectory, has already been established and there is no wave interference beyond the shield.
 
I am certain I am making a mistake, but I cannot figure out where.  My background is engineering and I am reading physics on my own. I appreciate any help in understanding and resolving this question.",5,2020-08-19 01:16:51,physics

My daughter is just about ready to tackle physics which I think she will really like. However today I got her to watch the start of a course on Great Courses Plus about classical physics and it was just terribly boring. The lecturer was really awkward and we didn't really learn much of anything.

She loves the 3Blue1Brown series of videos and has just started Grant's ""Essence of Calculus"". So I'm hoping to find something similar to that, but for Physics.

I also like to try and get her to understand the significance of people's contributions and what lead them to their discoveries (hence why I tried the Great Courses Plus lectures). So something with a bit of history would be great, but even if that was a different series altogether that would be fine.

She uses Khan Academy but she's finding it a bit dry (hence why we are starting Calculus with 3B1B).

Probably her favourite series ever was Welch Labs ""Imaginary Numbers are real"". If there was something out there as good as that for Physics I'd be over the moon.

She's fine with any math before calculus, so if it goes into that in any significant detail it's probably too advanced for her. I probably should have found something myself by now, but I was a physics major and I've actively been avoiding it because she's super into Math and Grammar and I don't want her to feel like she has to enjoy things that I like.",0,2020-08-18 11:01:24,physics

241,ic1rj1,I built a tool to convert quantum circuits to LaTeX tikz figures,"Last weekend I coded a python script for drawing quantum circuits from [Quirk](https://algassert.com/quirk) - a toy quantum circuit simulator. Basically, you drag and drop components/gates building a circuit and this tool helps you LaTeXify them instead of manually typing.

Here is the link to [repo](https://github.com/abhayhegde/pyquirk).

During one of the endsem exams this semester, I found myself wasting hours trying to write answers that involved circuits. Keeping track of wires, gates etc. was frustrating enough in LaTeX that I wondered why a tool like this does not exist. Hope this could be of some use to people.

I know it is basic coding and it is unoptimized at best. It may not be all you want, or in fact if you have other kind of gates that are not available on [Quirk](https://algassert.com/quirk), this would not be of much use. But I don't expect much for a project that took only one of my weekends. May develop into a better one later. :)

If you have queries, doubts, suggestions etc., please let me know, I would really appreciate them. DMs are always open too. :)

(2) Assuming we fall into a huge black hole feet first, and don't get torn apart, will we slowly lose sight of our feet, then your legs, then body as light will stop travelling to our eyes?

Here is what ive been thinking about, and i need your help to find the problem with my reasoning.

A: Everything moves with the speed of light
B: The faster you go through space, the slower you go thought time (light moves at c and does not move through time)

POSTULATE: Every particle, that builds a macro object like atoms and ourselves, moves at the speed of light, only changing directions due to forces, circling around stable attractors, that slowly change, as to give the impression of the body aging.

1. If this is the case, the macro object itself would not age (change at all) if all the particles that build it move in the same direction, since their relative positions with respect to each other would not change.

2. When the macro object does not move, all the particles would move around each other the fastest, hence the object will be changing the fastest.

Then acceleration would be the particles that build the object starting to change their velocity more and more in the same direction.

287,ibf2eo,Difference between magnetic field component of electromagnetic waves and magnetic fields/electric fields,"This might be an amateur question, but I have been thinking about this while in a zoom meeting. 

My understanding is that a charged particle at rest produces an electric field while a charged particle in motion (either accelerating or at a constant velocity) produces both an electric field and a magnetic field. 

Also, a charged particle moving with a constant velocity or at rest does NOT produce electromagnetic waves, while an accelerating charged particle does produce electromagnetic waves. 

Are these two phenomena independent and different? That is, will an accelerating charged particle produce an electric field, a magnetic field, AND an electromagnetic wave? If so, for an accelerating charged particle, what is the difference between the magnetic field component of the electromagnetic wave produced by the particle and the magnetic field produced due to the fact that it is in motion?

Because of corona virus, we didn't get started with the course yet, and our online classes have been sub par to say the least ( In all my 6 subjects together we done about 4 chapters ), and so I'm starting school in 2 weeks and i have to take the tests next May (late may).

The reason I'm posting this here is because I'm strongly considering going to college to study physics, to get into the physics course i need to get between 511-625 (it changes between years), where each subject has a max of 100 points (A = 100 points) and i start off with 25 points since I'm doing higher level maths. So if i want to study physics i need to get at least 4/5 A's and 2/1 B's. 

That's a pretty high grade with very little time to study, so that's why I'm posting this question, I'm looking for some tips and online resources to help me understand physics, maths and applied maths. I've tried khan academy but i just cant get used to it for some reason.",0,2020-08-17 08:35:16,physics

291,ibe2j2,I can't seem to solve this problem,"Overview:
So after playing a few games of KSP, I came up with a relatively easy problem (from what I can tell, it's been simplified beyond practical use in rocketry and now is just a math problem I cannot solve). I am an undergrad studying physics and haven't taken a more advanced math course than multidimensional and multivariable calculus. I am *not* looking for answers. I would prefer to avoid using approximations unless absolutely necessary. I am looking for a nudge in the right direction. No matter what I do, it seems to complicate the problem beyond necessity. Lmk if you have questions and lmk if I'm being stupid. This will be posted on r/physics and r/theydidthemath

The problem: 
A particle of constant mass (with mass m) moves from massive point A (with mass MsubA) to massive point B (with mass MsubB) which are a distance R appart. The particle has a thruster that must continually be on and produces an acceleration thrust of alpha with constant acceleration (or a constant thrust of alpha and m). However, the particle must start and finish it's trajectory with zero initial and final velocities. At what point in time or space should the particle's thruster reverse directions? What is the critical velocity? Points A and B are stationary relative to one another and have no spin. They have no atmosphere and have an assumed radius of zero. All forces are conservative. 

Interesting note: 
The particle itself starts and ends very close but never ON the points A and B (to avoid infinities). It is therefore assumed that the particle starts a distance far enough from A and stops at a distance far enough from B such that alpha still has an effect on net force (though this affect should approach zero). These distances are significantly smaller than R and will not affect the final answer whether or not they are factored in. 

Here's what I've tried: 
Using kinematics leaves you with a relatively simple expression for net acceleration as a function of distance to point A and point B and alpha. I don't think integration is possible yet because alpha is not yet defined (where it's magnitude is, it's direction isn't: I would need to find the critical point where maximum velocity can still be accelerated , by net acceleration, towards zero upon reaching point B... What would that be a function of? Time? Distance? The number of ants in an ant colony). Additionally: I don't think integration is possible yet because distance to A and B are functions of time. I need to find a way to represent those two distances in a way that I can integrate. Since R is known, I can simply subtract the distance to one point from R and be left with only one unaccountable variable instead of two, but I still have no function in relation to time. That got me stuck super quick. Ive tried momentum but I honestly don't even know where to start because I would still need to integrate net acceleration to find a function for velocity. I haven't tried using energy but if I did I don't think it would provide many answers.",21,2020-08-17 08:24:26,physics

296,ibdlmk,[Idea] Creating an open community to have regular open discussions about Physics and Mathematics and learning together,"So lately I've been reading this amazing book by E.T Bell called [Men Of Mathematics](https://www.amazon.com/Men-Mathematics-Touchstone-Book-Bell/dp/0671628186) (highly recommended), and I'm reading it like a potterhead, taking peeks int lives of some of the great humans among us, who changed the course of history, and I don't think there's any other way one can get his mind charged with inspiration and love for science and mathematics. So one thing that I found quite common among the lives of most mathematicians, physicists and even philosophers (not necessarily from that book) , is that they continuously were engaging in discussion with other great minds of that time, through the best medium that they had at that time, letters, discussions at courts (of Friedrick for e.g.), sending open challenges to each other, and I believe these were pursued with least of academic interests, but rather to share the immense interest that they had with other like-minded people. And of course we still have these kind of open discussions in nearly every research university, for example, it's very likely that you can find a bunch of students talking on MIT campus about a groundbreaking theory, but the problem it's VERY less encouraged at many other places, where physics and mathematics have only become the things that ""old and boring"" people do in prestigious universities. And during this situation, of the pandemic, when we're forced to be indoors, it's very easy for people to just worry about their grades, and stick their heads in textbooks, and never realize how amazing an engaging discussion can be on the same thing that they just wanna cram for exams. So the goal of this proposal is simply this, to openly discuss (over video/audio) on a regular basis, and learn in a better way from different perspectives. The goal is to learn the art of solving problems together, to learn how we can approach a seemingly trivial problem from a totally novel and intuitive way, and of course to have fun in the process of doing this. Even if it might just be 2-hours a week, but I believe this can make us have more resilience towards problem solving, enhance our ability to think differently, and much more than that, the fun of doing it together. This philosophy is heavily borrowed from Paul Zeitz, a great guy. To know more about what I actually mean check out [Proof School](http://www.proofschool.org/) and his amazing book [Art And Craft Of Solving Problems](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Art+and+Craft+of+Problem+Solving%2C+3rd+Edition-p-9781119239901), which of course is highly recommended, but is also the basis of the philosophy that I borrow from.

I'm posting this here to get feedback about if the idea that I have, has any chance of actually being out to work, regarding the platform I believe Discord can work pretty well for voice chats, or Google Meet for the discussions, and I guess if it works quite well then we can even start a [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) and gather many other people of the same interests. And I think the only limitations to indulge into this would be, an immense interest in spending time being puzzled over problems with others, and is at least has basic Physics and mathematics knowledge (high school level at least), I think we can keep this open t everyone from students, to post grads and even professors, if they're interested, it can actually broaden our perspective on a lot of things.   


I'd like to hear this sub's response over this, feel free to recommend new ideas and changes if you have. Shoot me a DM if you're interested in participating and if I see enough of positive feedback then I'll post an update to this detailing how to join and participate in discussions.

My hypothesis is that by using not one, not two but three arrows at once, Legolas reduces the force of each arrow. Isn't the bow's energy divided into each arrow by doing so? This would mean, he would only use one third of the bow's energy in order to penetrate the Oliphant's skin three times.

Hello all,

First of all, I hope my post will fit this subreddit. I would post this to [r/nostupidquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/nostupidquestions/), but I think that I can somehow get a better picture of a theory I came up with here. I don't know if I am the first to ever think about this, but trying to look up what I have in mind yielded no results.

Imagine the following scenario. You are in a room, and there is a table and an empty glass of water on it. Suddenly the glass flies across the room in a random direction and breaks. Most people would count this as a paranormal phenomena, and when relating the story they would very likely mention ""ghost activity"". But I thought of the following.

What if somehow the glass for a mere nanosecond got stuck in spacetime (hence, no force acts upon it for that super short period of time). In the meantime the earth will have moved through spacetime (rotated around its own axis and its elliptical orbit around the Sun as well). Is as if talking on a quantum physics level  (I know this regards small particles, but it's just to imagine the scenario more easily), the glass' wave function was unresolved for that period of time.

Then the glass of water somehow returns to the initial state, or its wave function collapses to a resolved state. Obviously, even when talking nanoseconds (or even smaller time frames), the glass' current position will be very different from its initial one. Hence, the effect perceived by us as humans, is that it flies across the room and maybe smashes into a wall, or it simply falls on the ground when gravity starts pulling on it again, or whatnot.

As a science lover who doesn't believe in paranormal activity or ghosts, would you consider this a valid explanation for such a phenomena? Thanks in advance, looking forward to hear your opinion.

P.S. I am by no means an expert in general relativity, or quantum physics. I am also aware that the two don't really go together, I just wanted to describe the experiment in both fields, more or less. I am an IT guy, but I am really passionate about spacetime and the physics behind it, and watch a lot of videos about this.

You have a load, let's say 2,000kg, hanging with chains from three points. If the arrangement of the lifting points is symmetrical, the sum of the plane angles of each chain leg is 240°. And if the angle from the vertical is 20°, then the tension in each leg would be (19,620N/3)/cos20°=6,960N. But if you had an asymmetrical lift, and the sum of the plane angles of one leg was 300° and 210° in the other two legs, how would this affect the tension in the legs? I tried something like this. 100%/720°=0.139%/°. And with that I get 0,139\*300°=41,7%, 3\*6960N=20,880N, 0,417\*20,880N=8,707N for the leg with biggest sum of the plane angles.

All this together I usually find myself spending an hour (roughly) per problem that’s 6 hours for the assignment and on top of this I also have Dynamics, Statistics, and Thermodynamics that I also have to study for and read on the chapters on.

I don’t know what to do, it seems like a recurring issue of just being completely lost and looking it up. I want to learn and I hate that I have to keep doing that but I don’t have a choice unless I want my grades to plummet.

I am a rising sophomore, majoring in physics. I was recently reviewing Newtonian Mechanics from the book ""Kleppner and Kolenkow"". On page 88, it says that ""the acceleration of a particle under gravity is independent of its own mass"". They prove this by equating F=ma with Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, whereby the mass of the object in question is cancelled. However, they mention that the two masses are mysteriously the same although they represent ""Gravitational"" and ""inertial"" mass.

Can someone please throw some light on what exactly is the distinction between these two kinds of masses (from a conceptual point of view) ? Also, I would appreciate it if someone could let me know if the mysterious equivalence has been explained till date.

I’m about to graduate with a decent GPA but absolutely no experience. My academic process has been a bit unorthodox to the golden standard (I.e. transferring schools, changing from unrelated major, first gen student, etc.), so I’ve been “late to the game” in some regards. As a given effort, I’ve been completing side projects that I find interesting and apply concepts I’ve learned in my course work. For example, I’ve built a working thermoelectric cloud chamber. My question is: what are some of your favorite experiments or demonstrations? My idea for a cloud chamber stemmed from coming across a video of one being demonstrated, and I was stoked when I saw it. So I’m looking for projects that pose some difficulties in recreating, but are ultimately great for learning and genuinely interesting to do! I’m open to anything haha

It was similar in design to this. Obviously, I know that the gravitational potential energy of the mass is converted to kinetic energy as it falls, which is translated through the pulley's string and to the pulling of the wheels. But how is this translates to the wheels mathematically?

If something from the ground here on earth is sent in a perfect 90° angle straight up will this object (taking all variables like wind, aerodynamics, etc) out of play, will this object land directly where it was launched from given the rotation of the earth? 

My thought is, if say you do this experiment in a ""vacuum"" and can control all aspects besides the rotation of the earth the object does land just a bit of center from where it was sent up because of that rotation.

Thus, the particles don't really care to coat the surfaces as expected. If this is the case, what would be a good way to ground the equipment to allow the electrostatic spray to work the way that it should? Or would that even work?

About a year ago, a friend and I started an educational non-profit with the goal of introducing kids to emerging technologies at a low cost. Within that year, we were able to teach hundreds of teens and college students about quantum computing by hosting workshops, posting articles, and launching our own successful quantum computing camp in collaboration with q-Braid.

Our high participation and audience engagement convinced us to begin the process of expanding our curriculum to include other emerging technologies (AI, Blockchain, etc.). We are also planning on hosting larger-scale events like in-person workshops, hackathons, and tech summits! But in order to expand our educational resources, we must first expand our team. We’re looking for ambitious, driven, high school/college individuals that are passionate about our cause. Best part is, you don't need prior knowledge of quantum computing or any other kinds of emerging technologies!

465,i959na,Question about potential effects of asteroid mining on Earth's behavior in space...,"Hey all! I'm a physics layman with a question. I apologize in advance if this question should be directed to another more specific physics sub or if this a repeat question. I searched the sub for ""asteroid mining"" but didn't see anything relevant.  

TL;DR - Could introducing more mass over time via asteroid mining and the way we distribute that mass across the planet have a meaningful impact on Earth's rotation, orbit, gravitational pull, etc...?  


As I understand it, the Earth's mass (and its distribution) is an important factor in many things including but not limited to the Earth's rotation about its axis, the Earth's orbit around the sun, the Earth's gravitational pull, etc... With the advent of asteroid mining on the horizon it made me wonder if there could be any unintended consequences to this really cool technological advancement. The first thing that jumped out to me is that we will be artificially(?) introducing more mass into the system. I understand the earth weighs something like 6x10\^21 tons while ejecting and accepting roughly equivalent amounts of mass every year without our help (I keep seeing \~50,000 tons in/out). I would think it would take an insane amount of mass increase to have any meaningful impact on the behaviors I mentioned previously. That being said, I once read online (so it must be true!) that the construction of the Hoover dam actually had a measurable impact on Earth's rotation (a small fraction of a microsecond iirc) essentially due to just changing mass/weight distribution of the land and even more so the water.  


It may take quite a while but barring any human intervention, such as deliberate mass ejections to help offset mass gains from mined asteroids (just the first potential solution that comes to mind), is there any meaningful threat to Earth's behavior in space due to a large increase in mass over many decades or centuries of asteroid mining? Would it matter how we distribute that new mass across the planet? Anyone know of a good paper or discussion on this topic?

*Also, thank you to everyone who offered to help or wants. I don't think I have the energy right now to expand but If I ever get there I have all your offers saved.*

Anyway, here's what you are here for, the apps:


## All Apps

You can see all the apps in one place, including the ones that I posted last week. 

[all apps](https://whscience.org) - [physics apps](https://whscience.org/physics/) - [biology apps](https://whscience.org/biology/) - [chemistry apps](https://whscience.org/chemistry/)

## New Physics Apps

I teach physics so most of what I have is physics. 

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Air Pressure Paper](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up.

[Ball on Ramp](https://whscience.org/ballramp/) - **Physics** - A simple ball on a ramp. Drag to change the height and width of the ramp. I use this one to practice planning and carrying out investigations. I also have a version with friction that I use for my forces tests I will try to find. 

[Cannon](https://whscience.org/cannon/) - **Physics** - Cannon that fires a ball. You can change the power of the cannon and the angle of fire. Students use a ruler to measure the range of the cannon and a stopwatch to measure air time. There is a fair amount of randomness so students can practice more of the skills in analyzing and interpreting data. 


[Elastic Energy](https://whscience.org/elastic/) - **Physics** - Drag to stretch a rubber band. Shows the distance, force required, and elastic energy. I use this for practice describing patterns as linear and non-linear. 

[Measuring Gravity](https://whscience.org/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance.  

[Light and Temperature](https://whscience.org/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Not new this week but a redditor asked for a [version where the cart rolls back](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotionrollback/) if it stops on the hill.

[Storms](https://whscience.org/storms/) - **Physics** - Students change the temperature of the atmosphere and see the effect on clouds and wind. A very simplified version of a weather simulation. I used this as a summative assessment where students practiced finding patterns and then constructing explanations of why climate change causes more violent storms using ideas about kinetic and potential energy. 

[Wave Interference](https://whscience.org/waveinterference/) - **Physics** - Change the wavelength and amplitude of two waves and see the resultant wave. The waves move so it looks like a real wave. 


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[cars](https://whscience.org/cars/)  - **Physics** - Three cars of different colors drive along a road. Students can time them and use calculations to determine their velocities. I also have versions with accelerations if people are interested. 

[Measuring Gravity](https://whscience.org/gravity/) - **Physics** - I normally do an activity where I drop a metal ball down a three flight stairwell and have students time it. I can't do that remotely so I will use this simulation. Students time a 10m drop and then can calculate g. They can then use that to calculate a greater distance. 

[Measuring g on Moons of Jupiter](https://whscience.org/gonmoons/) - **Physics** - Students are given animations of a ball bouncing on four moons of Jupiter. They use a digital ruler and stopwatch to measure realistic values of g on each of the moons. I used it as a quiz where students were randomly assigned one of them and had to measure from the bottom to the top of the bounce and then calculate. 

[Wave Measurement Practice](https://whscience.org/wavemprac/) - **Physics** - The app generates a graph of a wave on a grid. Students practice measuring wavelength, amplitude, and number of waves. The app checks if they are right and keeps track of how many they have in a row.  

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Stick Figure](https://whscience.org/stickfigure) - **Physics** - I use a lot of dynamic stick figures to illustrate a motion I am describing in writing. semi detailed stick figures with two-segment arms and legs can really help demonstrate what is happening. This app helps making them easier. 

[Two Wave Diagrams](https://whscience.org/twowavediagrams/) - **Physics** - Combines two waves and saves a png of the result. Waves can be combined with AM, FM, or with simple interference. AM and FM support square waves. Can change the wavelength, amplitude, and phase of each wave. Wavelength and Amplitude are in pixel units. For phase 1=-90° for some reason.


## New Biology Apps

[Bacteria Plate Streaking](https://whscience.org/streaking/) - **Biology** - Students practice the procedure of streaking a plate to isolate a bacteria culture. Heavy inspired by [this excellent simulation](http://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/content/streakplate.html) out of Michigan State University that unfortunately doesn't work well for remote learning because it requires  flash. A request of my wife's. 

[Transcription and Translation](https://whscience.org/transcriptiontranslation/) - **Biology** - Move base pairs around to transcribe off an open DNA sequence and then act as tRNA and bring in the right amino acid using a chart. I'm going to be honest. This app is so old I don't really remember making it but I tested it out and it seems to work fine. 

(Sorry, just two bio apps today)

## New Chemistry Apps

[Air Pressure Paper](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Very simple simulation of air particles hitting a paper. Drag the right edge of the paper to change its size.  Measures the width of the paper and the number of hits per second. I once started the year with trying to flip a ruler with a single sheet of news paper on it. This simulation helped the students make sense of why the news paper is able to stop the ruler if it is flat but not if it is folded up. Text is huge because I used it on a projector as a whole class. 

[Light and Temperature](https://whscience.org/lighttemp/) - **Chemistry/Physics** - Change the temperature of a black body. See the distribution of light by wavelength and see an approximation of the color. I have a version that shows the distribution by frequency too I could fix up if there is interest. 

(Sorry, just two for chemistry today but I have a friend who is asking me to make a several new high quality ones so there should be more chem soon.)

---

That brings the total to total number of apps and simulations to more than 30. I still have probably about 10 more old ones that need cleaning up and there are some new ones I'm working on (especially bio and chem.) When I have a bunch ready I'll post them to reddit but if you don't want to wait you can check [the live list](https://whscience.org) to see what's new.

Now being a physics student i know that all that is fake. But in the video at 6:35 they started explaining the science behind the vanishing of the train. According to them,

&gt;Fracture in time caused by some electromagnetic interactions, that are called **Chronal Holes.**

Now I have never read about this Chronal Holes thing, I only know about Sun's Coronal Holes and that's entirely different.

So the question is that are **Chronal Holes** a real thing, any theory or hypothesis or anything? If yes then what's the science behing it.

Hear me out: It seems that many people gladly respond to these kinds of questions, sometimes creating interesting discussions under somewhat mundane thread topics. However, right now the mods usually wake up after half a day or so, and then remove all these threads, since they obviously still violate the subreddit rules. But this not just encourages further rule-breaking submissions by the same posters, since they already got an answer, it also hinders discussion as a whole and sometimes even lets wrong explanations permeate. On the other hand, sometimes one of these threads picks up so much momentum in form of upvotes, that it isn't removed even though it technically still should be. So, right now, these ""rules"" are actually arbitrary and they facilitate a system to circumvent them. Thereby I suggest the following: If you can't enforce the rules correctly, don't enforce them at all. Just let people ask what they want and other people's votes shall decide the rest. This subreddit now has more than 1.3 million subscribers, meaning it has outgrown the original, purely academic target audience.

Every where it seems the 3 +0th law are discussed.

And apparently the axioms are practically unheard of (although, that may just be my shitty translation).


Are the following at all familiar/taught at BSc level thermo?

    1st axiom:
    There exist such states, which we refer to as equilibrium states, and which can be exactly defined by U internal energy, V volume and K types of matter for n_1,n_2...n_k quantities.
    2nd axiom:
    There exists a function of extensive parameters known as Entropy (S), using which all equilibrium states can be interpreted. An isolated complex system, lacking internal constraints, will have its extensive variables change to maximize the value of entropy over any such system which posseses an internal constraint.
    3rd axiom:
    A complex system's entropy is additive over its simple components. Entropy is a continuous differentiable function of internal energy that strictly increases.
    4th axiom:

Is there a ""correct"" way of stating directions of vectors or maybe a standard?

5 m/s, 60° N of W  
5 m/s, northwest

558,i843pd,The real Schrodingers cat,"Hi guys

I know it's kind of a lame thing to make a post about so I'm sorry but I just can't contain my curiosity

Some time ago I saw most probably a youtube video where someone explained the schrodingers cat thought experiment in a new light. There was a story about Einstein saying ""the moon is there whether I look or not"" and that the cat was actually Schrodingers answer that showed the flaw in Einsteins thinking. (to be safe I'll mention here - I know about decoherence, Einstein knew it's not about that) it's like einstein was saying rather ""you can say there are two(in the case of the existence of the moon) possibilities but there's still one reality whether I know about it or not"" and schrodinger replied ""actually it's not about that at all: that's how it is [...]"".
It was a pretty subtle thing and then I've realized that all those people whose explanations of schrodingers cat I've heard before didn't really know what they where talking about, it didn't make any sense and only in the context of that response it makes sense. Unfortunately I really have pathologicaly weak memory so I forgot the key thing and forgot and by who the video was (I'm even not sure if it was a video to be honest). 

If someone knows the video or anything else really, talking about that issue in that context I'd be delighted to grasp it again.

for a 1 square metre of surface, i think i can calculate the amount of radiation  emitted into space with the equation:

watts emitted = eσ(T1^4 - T2^4)

591,i7p6iz,Ferromagnetic Superfluid for Energy Storage,"Ferromagnetic fluids (aka ferrofluids) are fluids that are strongly magnetised in an magnetic field. Superfluids are fluids that has zero viscosity and can travel indefinitely without friction. A superfluid when stirred, forms vortices that spin indefinitely. Superfluidity is observed in liquid Helium when it is cooled to near zero Kelvin (changes with isotope of Helium). All sorts of bizzare properties are exhibited by superfluid Helium, much of which are yet to be explained. 

Now, it is said that superfluid 3 Helium A has ferromagnetic properties. What if a device is designed, where the superfluid exists inside a toroidal (doughnut shaped) casing and it is spun to high speeds using electromagnetic fields. The electrical energy will be stored as rotational energy of the fluid; similar to Flywheel energy storage systems we have currently. The fluid will spin indefinitely as there is no friction.   Electric energy can be absorbed from the rotating fluid as well. 

The energy storage capacity is only limited by the strength of the toroid casing. Else, the device could work as a perfect reservoir of energy. Ofcourse, it won't be 100% efficient, coz of cooling apparatus and other leakage losses. But wouldn't it be much better than whatever we already have for grid scale energy storage?

Is such a device possible?",11,2020-08-11 05:13:26,physics

603,i7lqe0,Quantum mechanics alt.,"So I am a high school student and I don't know much about quantum mechanics. But it made no sense to me how something can act as a particle and a wave at the same time. So I was thinking about it and this just came to me. It could be blatantly wrong :p

So I believe that all 2D objects are made by the rapid oscillation(at extremely high frequencies) of perfect 1D objects about a mean position. For example, a fan has 3 blades that appear to be 1D  and behaves like so. But when the fan spins, relative to us, it appears as a 2D disc-shaped object and behaves so(relative to us). 

1) A rapidly oscillating line can appear as a square, rectangle, etc.

2) A rapidly oscillating ring(circle) which also varies in radius constantly can appear as a disc. etc

So maybe all 3D objects are made by the rapid oscillation of such perfectly 2D objects about a mean position. So for example:

1) An oscillating disc which constantly changes its radius can make a sphere

2) A rapidly oscillating square can make a cube etc.

So at a classical/everyday physics level, since the frequencies of vibration of such objects are very high, we are unable to perceive it and behave like a 3D body(solid). However, at a quantum level, when two quantum objects of similar vibrational frequency interact, relatively, their vibration causes them to behave like waves but also like 2D particles. Different frequencies of vibration can give rise to different properties of matter.

675,i6hzez,Feedback for a basic proof involving stationary/standing waves in tubes,"If this is not the right place to post please let me know.

I was bored and decided to make a proof that standing waves formed in the air columns in a closed tube can only take frequencies of integer multiples of the frequency of any harmonic. However something about it feels wrong- could someone identify any mistakes or incorrect assumptions? Thanks in advance. I am not particularly confident in my physics ability hence why I wanted to challenge myself by proving something cool. I think the problem lies in khπ = qπ at the end, I'm not sure why one should be in terms of h and the other in terms of q when they are essentially the same thing.

------
For a standing wave to form in a column of air in a closed tube, the wave must have zero amplitude at both ends of the tube. Thus a sinusoidal function is needed that begins with a value of zero amplitude and reaches a value of zero amplitude again after some multiple of the wave's period. y = sin(x) works well for this. Let us call x the 'period cutoff point' (not sure if there is a proper name for this so I came up with this one). 

We can see for a standing wave to form the allowed period cutoff points, i.e. allowed x values, are in the form qπ where q is an integer &gt; 0 (I have proved this elsewhere and am confident the proof is sound. I will obviously include this proof in my final proof). The first harmonic of an air column in a closed tube will be q = 1, second q = 2 etc. Therefore in this case the allowed x values are q = h where h is the harmonic number.

The number of waves inside a tube of length L is equal to the period cutoff point of the whole set of waves divided by 2π, i.e. giving the number of cycles. This is also equal to the length L divided by the wavelength of the wave inside, λ\_(h-1). As v = fλ,  we can see (x/2π) = (L/λ\_(h-1)) is the same as (x/2π) = (f\_(h-1))L/v. From this it is seen x is directly proportional to f\_(h-1).

Let us scale f_(h-1) by some number k. This scales x by k. Thus khπ = qπ which implies kh = q. For kh to be an integer, k must be either an integer or 1/h. The latter of this represents scaling down a higher harmonic to the first harmonic. Thus waves can only be formed at frequencies either integer multiples of the 'h'th harmonic or at multiples of the frequency that cause it to be scaled down to f_0.",0,2020-08-09 06:42:41,physics

692,i69sgw,Homopolar generators and noninertial coordinates in relativistic electrodynamics.,"I have been playing with electrodynamics lately and I am how to interpret noninertial coordinate transformations. As an example, let's transform a stationary magnetic field pointing in the direction of the z axis to rotating coordinate frame (using differential form notation as that is the only thing I am familiar with).

In cartesian coordinates, we have electromagnetic 2-form

    F = dx ^ dy

If we first transform this to cylindrical coordinates (t, r, 𝜃, z) using the standard definition, we get

    F = r dr ^ d𝜃

Now we transform to rotating coordinate frame (t', r', 𝜃', z') by

    t = t'
    r = r'
    𝜃 = 𝜃' - 𝜔t'
    z = z'

where 𝜔 is our angular velocity. This means we have
    
    dt = dt',  dr = dr',  d𝜃 = d𝜃' - 𝜔dt', dz = dz'

and thus

    F = r' dr' ^ d𝜃' - 𝜔r' dr' ^ dt'

And this is where my confusion begins. At this point, most people just sort of proclaim that
the electric 1-form is E = 𝜔r'dr', integrate that radially and proclaim a ""voltage"" across the generator
is 𝜔r'/2.

However, this seems highly dubious to me. We have defined the components of the electromagnetic 2-form in cartesian coordinates only and thus proclaiming that whatever the t' coordinate represents in our rotating coordinate system to be the ""time"" seems unsubstantiated.

If we pull back the Minkowski metric, we notice that the frame (∂t', ∂r', ∂𝜃', ∂z') nor the coframe (dt', dr', d𝜃', dz') are even orthonormal! In fact, we have that
&lt;∂t'|∂t'&gt; = 𝜔^2r'^2 - 1, so the ∂t' tangent vectors switch from being timelike to being
spacelike as the tangential velocity crosses the speed of light (which seems reasonable),
but I have no idea how to interpret this physically.

How do I compute this correctly? Is there even a concept of ""voltage"" in arbitrary coordinate systems?
I was thinking along the lines of introducing a constant charge density 4-vector, then computing the lorentz force form and then line integrating that, but I have no idea if that is the correct approach.",0,2020-08-08 19:10:27,physics

not in its state of lowest energy. It could release a huge amount of energy if
it could collapse into a neutron star configuration. To collapse, it has only
to penetrate a barrier of finite height and thickness. It is an interesting
question, whether there is an unsymmetrical mode of collapse passing over a
lower saddle point than the symmetric mode. I have not been able to find a
plausible unsymmetric mode, and so I assume the collapse to be spherically
symmetrical. In the action integral (31), the coordinate x will be the radius
of the star, and the integral will extend from r, the radius of a neutron
star, to R, the radius of the iron star from which the collapse begins. The
barrier height U(x) will depend on the equation of state of the matter, which
is vey uncertain when x is close to r. Fortunately the equation of state is
well known over the major part of the range of integration, when x is large
compared to r and the main contribution to U(x) is the energy of
nonrelativistic degenerate electrons

U(x) = (N^(5/3)hbar^2/2mx^2),                                           (42)

where N is the number of electrons in the star.

The integration over x in (31) gives alogarithm

log(R/R_0),                                                             (43)

where R_0 is the radius at which the electrons become relativistic and the
formula (42) fails. For low-mass stars the logarithm will be of the order of
unity, and the part of the integral coming from the relativistic region
x &lt; R_0 will also be of the order of unity. The mass of the star is

M = 2Nm_p.                                                              (44)

I replace the logarithm (43) by unity and obtain for the action integral (31)
the estimate

S = N^(4/3) (8m_p/m)^(1/2) = 120N^(4/3).                                (45)

The lifetime is then by (30)

T = exp(120N^(4/3))T_0.                                                 (46)

For a typical low-mass star we have

N = 10^56, S = 10^77, T = 10^(10^76) yr.                                (47)

In (46) it is completely immaterial whether T_0 is a small fraction of a
second or a large number of years.

We do not know whether every collapse of an iron star into a neutron star will
produce a supernova explosion. At the very least, it will produce a huge
outburst of energy in the form of neutrinos and a modest burst of energy in
the form of x rays and visible light. The universe will still be producing
occasional fireworks after times as long as (47).",0,2020-08-08 17:54:09,physics

Universe is 4-dimensional. Fact. We perceive the 3, the 4th being the passage of time. If we were to see a 4-dimensional object, it would appear as this weird cross section that would just be a 3D shape to us (I saw a brilliant video on this, search up “How will we perceive 4-dimensional objects?”. 
But, no object in our universe is 2-dimensional (to my knowledge; please correct me if I am wrong), so in the same way, is it possible nothing is actually 3-dimensional, and everything is a 4 dimensional object?
The fourth dimension of each object is it’s state at all possible moments of it’s existence, and we perceive just that “cross section”, and as the cross section changes we see that as the passage of time, and therefore an object is in every position and state it will ever be, and has been, at once, and we can only see an ever-changing sliver. (This can be likened somewhat to superposition.)

Hence, at some level, everything is predefined, but also not?

I personally don’t really believe this, and I hope u guys can make sense of it, and hopefully its not total bollocks to you. It falls apart to some degree whenever you think about it too much, but so do some key areas of physics.

Hello, please excuse the poor drawing.

I'm trying to get the value of the magnetic flux density of this u shaped electromagnet for any x value as seen in the figure above. I know everything else about the system, I'm looking for some ecuation where I could get the value of B for any x.

When working with uniform shaped coils I can use that ecuation, however I'm not sure on how to apply it to this system.

Basically I have a U shaped piece of steel, on both of its ""legs"" there are 600 turn coils connected to a power source that may vary between 0 and 4 amperes. On the top of the electromagnet there are two pole pieces with a circular shaped hole of 0.006m radius. This experiment is done by moving a Hall probe through those holes, however I need to know mathematically what values the Hall probe is going to get.

I  do have an idea of what the values are, right in the middle of both pole pieces with an intensity of  4 amperes the magnetic flux is of around 200mT. What I'm looking is: How, mathematically, do I get the value of the magnetic flux density of this system?

776,i5c8w0,Is tokamak fusion viable?,"I believe I know the answer but I want outside perspective. I've been planning a 2nd reactor since the 1st was just a pretty desk light. And that's been a year. The idea is to inject hydrogen and oxygen 2:1 ratio. Once ignited via 1 mm spark, the electromagnets combined with custom made permanent magnets will overcome the forces from the reaction to confine the fire and via direct energy coversion harness the photons emitted and twist the fire into a plasma with more pressure and heat. (Forgot to mention the iron filings as a catalyst for the reaction). In a previous experiment my handheld tokamak concept proved to be efficient when it unexpectedly bursted, releasing a huge arc of electricity across apprx. 10 feet (9,144,000volts assuming the air breaks down at the average voltage of 30,000 per cm depending on the enviroment). With only 120vDC at 10A. This was very short term as at the time I didn't realize I would trip the breaker due to a design error.

Once again I know I will be heavily critqued and the most grumpiest people will claim man made fusion is impossible. Which is understandable due to built up hype, promises, and failure. And I know it will work eventually if not when I first finish it (very likely to work mathematically). I just want an outaide perspective and advice/tips.",2,2020-08-07 06:39:23,physics

806,i4wwky,I've been making physics apps for my own classroom for years. With so many classes going remote I thought now was the time to share them.,"*What is this*

These are apps (really web-apps) that I've made for my own class or other teachers I know. They are mostly for physics because that's what I teach but there are a good number of others in there. They run on any interconnected device that isn't tooooo old. They are all free and will always be free.

**Who are you?**

I am a physics teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. For the last 7  years I've been teaching 9th grade physics but in the fall I will be switching to upper classmen. I have also have a minor biology and have taught it a little bit way back when.

**Why now?**

I've been sitting on these, some of them for years. I've always wanted other people to be able to use them but I've always been to lazy to make it happen. I've played around with the idea of making a start up but with so many kids needing to learn science outside of the lab this year I knew now was the time. 

I've spent the last few days figuring out how to host a website, buy a domain (What exactly is DNS? Did I configure it correctly?) and cleaning up the apps enough that another human who isn't me could reasonably figure out what to do with them. 

**What've you got for me?**

The apps are sorted by content area and how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free.
### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Bug In Meadow](https://whscience.org/buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click ""count"" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

[Mg HCl](https://whscience.org/mghcl/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates HCl reacting with Mg. Shows the molecules and graphs. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers.

[Rusting](https://whscience.org/rusting/) - **Chemistry** - Simulates rusting at different temperatures and environments and for different shapes. Shows the molecules. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Temperature Solids](https://whscience.org/temperaturesolids) - **Chemistry** - Simulates the movement of particles in two solids at different temperatures. You can change the size of each solid (number of particles) and starting temperature and you can drag them to touch or not touch. You see a graph of their temperature over time. I made this for a friend so I haven't used it personally, but It has been tested by a number of chemistry teachers. 

[Cart and Pulley](https://whscience.org/cartpulley) - **Physics** - Cart attached to a string over a pulley with a weight on the end. It has basic directions on the screen. Also available  [without directions](https://whscience.org/cartpulleynodirections).

[Collisions](https://whscience.org/collisions/) - **Physics** - Change masses and initial velocities and measure final velocities.

[Electric Car](https://whscience.org/electriccar/) - **Physics** - Is this useful to anyone? I don't know but I might as well put it here - You set the maximum speed of an electric car and watch the battery drain. I used it for my students to practice looking at linear and non linear relationships. It was part of a whole unit on electric cars. 

[Index of Refraction](https://whscience.org/ior/) - **Physics** - How can you tell the difference between a real diamond and a fake? Use Snell's law of course. Practice on water, glass, and plastic then determine if your diamond sample is real or a fake. In this simulation you drag and rotate a laser, ruler, and protractor. 

[Roller Coaster Motion](https://whscience.org/rollercoastermotion/) - **Physics** - Change the angle of the slope and initial of a roller coaster. Record and download position, velocities, and acceleration.


### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Gel and Restriction Enzymes](https://whscience.org/gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. 

[Ants](https://whscience.org/ants) - **Physics** - Two ants run across the screen. Students use a ruler and stopwatch (included digitally) to find velocity and acceleration. It's like a physics problem but with a real moving object so all the quantities have meaning. There are many calculations that can be done of varying difficulty.

[Motion Yes No](https://whscience.org/motionyn) - **Physics** - One of the hardest things for phsyics students is keeping a clear distinction between velocity and acceleration. This app helps by putting a moving object in front of them and asking, 'is there velocity?"", ""is there acceleration?"", ""is the velocity changing?"", etc. This is very frustrating for the students, but I find it to be very helpful. I have many versions of this asking about different quantities and including the direction. There is even a test version if people find it helpful. Keeps track of number in a row.

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Blood Pressure Diagram](https://whscience.org/bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Pedigree Maker](https://whscience.org/pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Energy Bars](https://whscience.org/energybars/) - **Physics** - Tiny app to make bar graphs of types of energy. Drag up and down in each bar. Double Tap the label at the top of a bar to remove it from the diagram. By default it shows kinetic (KE), potential (PE), chemical (CE), heat (HE), and total energy (TE). Hit save and it will download the image.

**What's next?**

I don't know. I have a lot more that I haven't cleaned up yet. If people are using them then I could work on them. I will probably be making a lot of new apps too since CPS is starting all remote in September.

824,i4qni7,How long can a shockwave travel faster than sound? (Beirut Explosion),"You all heard about the explosion in Beirut. The videos are scary as hell. And there are many news reporting it. Something I heard often now is the claim, that the shockwave of the explosion traveled faster than the speed of sound. I have some questions about this statement:

Okey I know a shockwave can travel faster than the speed of sound. But I thought this is only the case right after the detonation. So when the hot gas expands supersonic the shockwave must also travel subsonic (makes sense to me). But I thought after the gas has stoped expanding the shockwave slows down to the relative speed of sound. What I mean by that is the air around the fireball might be so hot and under such pressure, that the speed of sound under this conditions are faster than the ""regular"" speed of sound. But after a short while the energy is distributed and the shockwave travels through the air with the speed of sound. Am I correct?

Some newspaper also wrote: ""In the videos, you can see the effects of the shockwave before the sound is heard. That's because the shockwave travels faster than sound"". Statements like this doesn't make any sense to me. In my understanding the shockwave travels only faster than sound right after the detonation. But most of the videos were recorded hundrets of meters away from the blast. So I think the shockwave traveled almost the whole distance with the speed of sound. And IF the shockwave hits the cameraman more early than the sound, you would also hear something (shockwave = pressure difference over time = sound)

Can someone tell me if my understanding of shockwaves are right or if I am wrong?",17,2020-08-06 07:08:58,physics

828,i4puja,Beirut explosion TNT equivalent missunderstanding,"Hey, sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, I am posting here because I have seen a similarly themed thread yesterday.  


I held of on posting or asking about this because it feels disrespectful to those effected to turn their tragedy into an 'interesting spectacle', but it has been bothering me, so here is my question:  


All over the internet, people are asserting that the explosion in Beruit is somehow equivalent to around \~1kt of TNT. My understanding is that when this unit is used, then it refers to the energy of the explosion and is equivalent to an energy of \~4.1Gj \[1\].  


Given that the energy source for the explosion is now commonly accepted to be the 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored at the port, I have noticed many people quote the number \~0.4 as the ratio between ammonium nitrate, and TNT in explosive energy.  


However, my understanding is that this is the correct number for a binary explosive of ammonium nitrate and a hydrocarbon.  


Using the heat of formation for ammonium nitrate and the products of ammonium nitrate decomposition, I calculate a heat of explosion of around 36kJ per mole. \[2\] Dividing by the molecular weight of around 80 grams per mole \[3\], I obtain a specific heat of explosion of 450kJ/kg.  


Multiply this by the 2750 metric tonnes of ammonium nitrate, and the total energy of the explosion is found to be around 1.2Tj.  


If one then divides the total energy by the energy per tonne of TNT equivalent (\~4.1Gj), one gets the answer of 292t TNT equivalent.  


This is obviously much smaller than the commonly quoted 1.2kt, so have I made a mistake? Is there something else to consider?

And simultaneously, the decay &amp; death of the black hole they fall into?

We already know it’s impossible for anything to escape the horizon once it’s in (because gravity and the breakdown of spacetime), but I then thought of the universe outside the horizon is gone, there would be nothing else to go back to anyway. With infinite time being passed, everything is gone the moment a person crosses that horizon (assuming that’s how the universe dies anyway)

875,i45to1,Converting SI units to Planck units: A linear algebra approach,"A question that arose recently on /r/AskPhysics was how to convert SI units to Planck units.  Instead of going through the usual motions of demonstrating with one narrow example, I would like to offer a more generalized treatment (posted here for future reference).  

The following is a procedure for (1) determining the Planck units associated with the SI base units, and (2) converting any other physical quantity expressed in SI directly in terms of Planck units.  This procedure can be easily coded up in the programming language of one's choice for convenience.  The basis for Planck units are commonly given as *[c,G,hbar,k_e,k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units#Definition)*, and will be assumed here for the sake of presentation.  

(1) Each of the physical constants *c* (the speed of light), *G* (the constant of universal gravitation), *hbar* (the reduced Planck constant), *k_e*, (the Coulomb constant = 1/4piε0) and *k* (the Boltzmann constant) can be expressed as: 

    L^1 ⋅ M^0  ⋅ T^-1  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  c
    L^3 ⋅ M^-1 ⋅ T^-2  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  G
    L^2 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-1  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^0   =  hbar
    L^3 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-4  ⋅ C^-2 ⋅ Tmp^0   =  k_e
    L^2 ⋅ M^1  ⋅ T^-2  ⋅ C^0  ⋅ Tmp^-1  =  k

where *L* is the Planck length, *M* is the Planck mass, *T* is the Planck time, *C* is the Planck current, and *Tmp* is the Planck temperature.  Reading across each equation, the exponents correspond to the SI dimensions of the associated physical quantity; for example, k_e = 8.988⋅10^(9) m^(3)⋅kg^(1)⋅s^(-4)⋅A^(-2)⋅K^(0).  Taking logarithms:

    1⋅log L +  0⋅log M + -1⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log c
    3⋅log L + -1⋅log M + -2⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log G
    2⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -1⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log hbar
    3⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -4⋅log T  + -2⋅log C  +  0⋅log Tmp  =  log k_e
    2⋅log L +  1⋅log M + -2⋅log T  +  0⋅log C  + -1⋅log Tmp  =  log k

which is a system of five linear equations in five unknowns. The previous can be expressed in matrix form: 

    [ 1  0 -1  0  0 ] [ log L ]     [ log c  ]
    [ 3 -1 -2  0  0 ] [ log M ]     [ log G  ]
    [ 2  1 -1  0  0 ] [ log T ]  =  [log hbar]
    [ 3  1 -4 -2  0 ] [ log C ]     [log k_e ]
    [ 2  1 -2  0 -1 ] [log Tmp]     [ log k  ]

Multiplying both sides by the matrix-inverse of the left-most matrix: 

    [ log L ]     [ -3/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [ log c  ]
    [ log M ]     [  1/2 -1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [ log G  ]
    [ log T ]  =  [ -5/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ] [log hbar]
    [ log C ]     [   3  -1/2   0  -1/2  0 ] [log k_e ]
    [log Tmp]     [  5/2 -1/2  1/2   0  -1 ] [ log k  ]

which yields:

    log L   = -3/2⋅log c +  1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log M   =  1/2⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log T   = -5/2⋅log c +  1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar
    log C   =    3⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G                + -1/2⋅log k_e
    log Tmp =  5/2⋅log c + -1/2⋅log G + 1/2⋅log hbar                + -1⋅log k

Finally, exponentiating the above: 

    L   = c^(-3/2) ⋅ G^(1/2)  ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    M   = c^(1/2)  ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    T   = c^(-5/2) ⋅ G^(1/2)  ⋅ hbar^(1/2)
    C   = c^(3)    ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ k_e^(-1/2)
    Tmp = c^(5/2)  ⋅ G^(-1/2) ⋅ hbar^(1/2) ⋅ k^(-1)

(2) Any physical quantity *Q* given in SI units (disregarding those stupid quantities involving moles or candelas) can be directly converted to Planck units by way of the matrix product:

                  [ -3/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ]
                  [  1/2 -1/2  1/2   0   0 ]
    [ a b c d e ] [ -5/2  1/2  1/2   0   0 ]  =  [ A B C D E ]
                  [   3  -1/2   0  -1/2  0 ]
                  [  5/2 -1/2  1/2   0  -1 ]

where *a,b,c,d,e* are the exponents of the SI dimensions m^(a)⋅kg^(b)⋅s^(c)⋅A^(d)⋅K^(e) of *Q*; and then expressing as:

    u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C)⋅y^(-D)⋅z^(-E)   c^(A)⋅G^(B)⋅hbar^(C)⋅k_e^(D)⋅k^(E)

where *u* is the numerical value of *Q* in SI and *v,w,x,y,z* are the numerical values of the five physical constants *c,G,hbar,k_e,k* when expressed in SI.  The numbers given in the 5-by-5 matrix result from solving the set of five linear equations in part (1); this matrix transforms the vector space of SI-dimensions exponents into the vector space of Planck-dimensions exponents.  

You may notice that the exponents A,B,C,D,E are negated within the numerical section; why is this?  A justification follows: Suppose you are tasked with converting 90,000 square feet to acres.  You already know that 1 acre is 43,560 square feet, so you need to *divide* by that numerical factor (equivalently, *multiply by the reciprocal*) in order to get the correct result:   

     90000 sqfeet = x acres

     (90000 sqfeet)/(1 acre) = x

     (90000 sqfeet)/(43560 sqfeet) = x

     90000/43560 = x

     x = 2.0661

Note that the five physical constants *c,G,hbar,k_e,k* serve as base units in the Planck Unit System, just as *m,ks,s,A,K* do in SI.  If one is more concerned about just the pure numbers themselves (like many physicists who routinely use Planck units in their work and arbitrarily set those five physical constants to 1), one can simply drop the string of physical-constant symbols at the end and call it ""u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C)⋅y^(-D)⋅z^(-E)"".  

A sample problem:  ""The food Calorie, which is 1 kilocalorie, is the heat energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by 1 degree celsius.  This has been measured and subsequently defined to be 4184 J.  Express this energy in terms of Planck units.""   

Since this problem involves mechanical units (LMT) only, it suffices to make use only of the top left 3-by-3 submatrix of the full transform matrix.  

The physical dimensions of energy are L^(2)⋅M⋅T^(-2), which corresponds to the vector [a,b,c] = [2,1,-2].  

               [ -3/2  1/2  1/2 ]
    [ 2 1 -2 ] [  1/2 -1/2  1/2 ]   =  [ 2.5 -0.5 0.5 ]
               [ -5/2  1/2  1/2 ]

The numerical value of the Planck expression is u⋅v^(-A)⋅w^(-B)⋅x^(-C) = 4184 ⋅ 299792458^(-2.5) ⋅ 6.6743e-11^(0.5) ⋅ 1.0545718176461565e-34^(-0.5) = 2.139e-6.  The associated Planck unit is the Planck energy, which is c^(A)⋅G^(B)⋅hbar^(C) = c^(2.5)⋅G^(-0.5)⋅hbar^(0.5).  Putting them together:  

    1 Calorie = 4184 J = 2.139e-6 c^(2.5)⋅G^(-0.5)⋅hbar^(0.5)

or just plain old 2.139e-6 where the underlying unit is understood to be the Planck energy.

In normal day light they look dark brown, but if you look into them you can tell that they are lighter than that. 
In average sunlight they look like light brown/dark honey and greenish near the edges. 
When there is full light on them, artificial/the sun they look like yellow pools of honey. 

When I ask other people they say things like: light brown, brown, honey brown, hazel, amber. But of course this depends on how strong the lights are around me.

909,i3s900,Centrifugal force propellers in space? (Viable?),"I feel like this won’t work due to equal and opposite reaction..but I figured I’d consult others for feedback.

Before trying to conceptualize this, place your arms down by your sides, and leave them loose, don’t be tense. Then, twirl your body rapidly like a figure skater....do they not seem to rise? Now imagine...if you kept them tense, and at an angle like an arrow symbol ( —&gt; )..would that not cause force either down toward your feet or upward in the direction your arms want to go?

Pipedream Idea: 

Say I have a machine that is solar powered, that causes a rod to spin, and on the end of that rod is the tip of an “arrow” shape (—&gt;) with high density metal balls at both ends of the arrow point (&gt;) (for leverage)...

The centrifugal force of the spinning rod, would cause a force in the direction of where the arrow is pointing (due to the metal balls on the arms of the arrow tip, causing the tip to “want” to become a straight line ( l ) rather than an arrow (&gt;)...so yeah...if there were two of them, oriented in the same direction, one spinning clockwise, the other counterclockwise, in unison, would that not propel a vessel either forward or backward?

The fuel source would be photons from the sun...and the equal and opposite reaction would be the eventual impact of the kinetic energy stored in the momentum of the ship, impacting elsewhere...right? No? Maybe?

The things I’m unsure of:

-if the rotation of the rod also creates a force in the opposite direction. 

-where the “rising arms” force would be directed. It’s either in the direction of the arrow, or in the opposite direction...right?

My thoughts are that if this were able to generate force, then momentum can be gained with time and ships can travel using only sunlight as fuel! But...I’m no physicist...so yea...probably some contradiction in the hairbrained idea.

919,i3otmk,Order of Magnitude Estimates of the Beirut Port Explosion - Approx. kiloton TNT equivalent,"At first glance, this is superficially similar to the explosion in Tianjin port almost exactly five years, there appears to have been a major fire which detonated some explosive stored at the port. My background is in nuclear astrophysics, and I have a hobby interest in both nuclear explosions and high yield explosions in general (read: supernova and other transients). Digging up some notes and order of magnitude estimates I did following the Tianjin port explosion and using some rules I know from Glasstone and Dolan, we can make some estimates about the explosive yield in Beirut today. 

To begin, I will examine the [fireball growth](https://i.imgur.com/dgXE0Un.jpg) from this [video on twitter](https://twitter.com/arabnews/status/1290687176703967238). The fireball is only visible for a few frames, which I've assembled in that image.

Detailed analysis of the fireball is difficult, for obvious reasons, but there's still information to be extracted. For example, we can estimate a timescale from camera frame rates. The first frame is preceded by no visible fireball. A typical iPhone/smartphone camera captures at 30 frames per second, which is similar to Twitter's frame rate. 

For a length scale, we use the foreground objects as rulers. The foreground building nearest the explosion is, according to Google maps, the Beirut port silos. I measure its length to be between 100 and 150 meters. Given the angle of the building and the distance from the center of the fireball to the silos it's difficult to estimate the size of the explosion, but during the prompt expansion it does seem to exceed the dimensions of the silo, suggested a length scale of order 150 meters. 

While not precise, this does verify that there was a supersonic expansion phase into ~STP atmosphere, which allows us to generalize some of what we know about nuclear weapons. Furthermore, the size of the fireball as it enters its turbulent phase can be useful to estimate the maximum yield of the explosion. Typical scaling relations for surface detonations of nuclear weapons suggests a fireball radius of order (100 m)x(Yield/1 kilotonne TNT equivalent)^(0.3). This is the rough rule I keep in my head and not exact (I don't have the exact page in Glasstone and Dolan handy), but *taking the fireball radius to be of order 100 m to 200 m it suggests a yield in the 1-10 kiloton TNT equivalent regime.* I personally favor the low, 1ish kiloton regime given the superficial similarities to the events in 2015 in Tianjin (which was the explosion of 800 kilotons of ammonium nitrate). 

The most widely circulated videos seem to be taken from ~1-2 kilometers judging by foreground buildings, and is consistent with a shockwave arrival time of 3-6 seconds. Given the videos, it seems likely that the people operating those cameras experienced ~1ish PSI overpressure (and I hope they're okay!). This is a threshold I know for breaking glass, which may also be useful for estimating the yield. Regarding the impact of the shockwave, [CNN reports](https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/04/middleeast/beirut-explosion-port-intl/index.html): ""Homes as far as 10 kilometers away were damaged, according to witnesses. One Beirut resident who was several kilometers away from the site of the blast said her windows had been shattered by the explosion.""

While not explicit, we should wonder if windows were broken at 10 km. If we assume that the houses 10 km away did suffer broken windows as that would move the 1 psi overpressure radius to 10 km. As a rule, I also keep (1 km)(Y/1 kT TNT)^(0.3) in my pocket for the radius of 1 PSI overpressure. This would suggest a yield well beyond 10 kT TNT equivalent, indeed significantly greater than the Hiroshima or Nagasaki bombs, which seems significantly higher than the fireball analysis would suggest. I suspect that significant glass-breakage was experienced within 1-5 km.  

Seismic data and details regarding the explosion are also useful for also estimating yield, but are not available at this time. Furthermore, local atmospheric conditions and landscape/topography have a major effect on the impacts of high yield explosions, so it's difficult to improve on this estimate.  Again, these are order of magnitude estimates from scaling laws. They are quick and dirty- they're dirty precisely *because* they are quick. As more information comes out the error bars will shrink.",104,2020-08-04 13:30:42,physics

Nothing can travel faster than light, for now it is a fact, but how about light travelling faster than light. 

For example I am standing with a torch in my hand, pointing its light in one direction. And its light is going at light speed, as it should. 

How about light coming from headlights of the car travelling in the same direction. 

Surely, I am standing, the source is immobile but source from car is moving or even accelerating. By inertia the light too has the speed of car. My light only has its own speed which is constant.

So the light from car is travelling faster than speed of light.",28,2020-08-03 07:54:31,physics

981,i2vazs,Dreaming Parallel Realities," I have seen so many Sci-Fi, Paranormal and Unexplained Phenomenon movies, documentaries, TV Shows. My latest mind bending and the best TV Show ever is Dark without any doubt.

Talking of various Unexplained and Paranormal phenomenons that have been documented by so many people from so many years leads me to wonder about a strange and an interesting thought. I wonder if it can be true or logical up to any extent.

**I believe that all our dreams that we have seen since our childhood until the present day and also all those dreams that are yet to be seen by us till our death, are basically our astral bodies or you can say a part of our soul, tapping into infinite different parallel universes each night. Moreover, i believe that the dreams in which we find ourselves IN different unexplained situations are actually our other parallel realities in which we are living a different life. On the other hand, the dreams in which we observe them from a third person's perspective and not actually participating in them at all, are those parallel realities in which we don't exist at all.**

Its strange that i have not seen anywhere about this kind of theory yet, although i have been reading many theories, stories, and strange instances across the world about Parallel Universes since many years.

So, guys what do you think about this idea of Parallel Universes? Do mention in the comments and upvote if you like the idea...",7,2020-08-03 06:24:47,physics

984,i2tlu4,Are Sci Fi depictions of science based in reality or truly fictional?,"Hello everyone, 

First of all I would like to apologize in advance if some of my questions seem to be dumb , I have never actually studied Physics but it is a subject that I am deeply interested in and my passion for it is truly high.

&amp;#x200B;

Also I would like to aplogize for any grammatical errors that I may end up making , English is not my first langauge. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am plannin on studying high school physics in the near future with the hopes of getting accepted to a respectable establishement and begin my jounry into Astrophysics studies , it is but an end goal but a goal nonetheless.

My question is this:

We often see how science is made into this amazing wonder of a thing , sometimes even sort of ""magical"" in TV shows or movies.

They depict a reality where we have discovered how to break light speed , how to warp space time and jump through wormholes , the whole shabang.

I was wondering how much of this is based in reality , at least to some extent.

For example , right now we are pretty much dependable on conflagration thrusters which use chemical fuel , and because of that we can forget about reaching turly high speeds let alone get to mars in less than 8 months.

I know that NASA are wroking on ION engines but I doubt that even those can get us to mars in less than 8 months.

Do we have any understanding on how to even begin reaching light speed? could we actually achieve it using current theories? can a person's body actually withstand the forces that derive from actually beign in light speed?

Do we have any understanding on worm holes? how they work? how they're formed? could we one day bend space using technology or using our current understand of the sapce time continuum ?

Do we have any understanding on Quantum physics? I know there are models like the Everett many world's interpretationand the Multivirse thoery , are any of those based in reality? would we actually be able to observe other dimensions or ""worlds"" using our understanding of quantum mechanics and the world ?

&amp;#x200B;

These are questions that have been on my mind for a lot of time now , Physics is , and always will be my most favorite subject , and I hope to achieve something meaningful in my life one day being in this field.",6,2020-08-03 03:51:21,physics

Question:

 A) a student used the equations of motion to model the behaviour of a ball when kicked at different angles to the horizontal. She predicted the height of the ball when it reached the goal, presuming it was kicked from the same place, with the same initial speed, each time. The results are shown below:  


Angle Height  
10 -0.78  
20 1.0  
30 2.8  
40 4.7  


i) State the significance of the negative value of height at an angle of 10.  


B)  
i) During a football match the ball is kicked towards the goal, at an angle of 15 degrees to the horizontal, from a distance of 11m as shown.  
The ball has a diameter of 0.22m and an initial speed of 26ms-1. The goal is 2.4m tall.  
By means of calculations, determine whether or not the ball will pass into the goal. You may ignore the effects of air resistance.

989,i2syla,A thought experiment,Suppose a spaceship moving at 99.99% the speed of light. Inside the spaceship there is a particle detector and some electron and positron. Because the spaceship is moving at 99.99% of speed of light the relativistic kinetic enrgy of each electron and positron would be about 2.5 Gev. In low energy case of electron and positron annihilation event two or more photon are produced but not heavier particles then electron or positron because there is not enough energy.In higher energy case electron positron annihilation event can produce heavier particles like moun-antimuon pair because they have enough energy for there rest mass. So in our experiment we annihilation each electron positron pair and observe them with the particle detector. Because the electron and positron have enough kinetic energy we should see other heavier particles like muons or D mesons.But this contradict inertial reference frame thus violating special relativity.

(I'm very new to Reddit so I'm sorry if this isn't how it works)

In October I am hoping to start a masters degree in Mathematical Physics, after taking a year out after my undergraduate. What with senior-itis and being given the chance to study abroad, it has been three years since I have studied quantum mechanics properly so I thought it might be a good idea to self-study it again before going into the postgrad. But self-studying is a lonely process and one of my favourite things about my degree was the community around the physics department when we were all stuck on a problem.

With that being said, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in creating a study group this summer going through the MIT courses ([one](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2016/index.htm), [two](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/) and [three](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-06-quantum-physics-iii-spring-2016/))?

I’ve noticed there are lots of online physics courses out there, such as the ones by MIT. If I take these online courses, would they serve as good evidence that I have a decent grounding in physics? It seems that universities are not too strict when accepting students from other science disciplines as long as they have some physics experience so that’s why I’m thinking taking some online undergraduate physics courses might be sufficient.

1015,i2cn9z,Folded-matter wave hypothesis yields universe evolution and solves EPR paradox,"Dear Observer 

I take this opportunity to briefly introduce my new publication with title : i, in the palm of my mind : the chapters are available to observe and freely consider online 


In my book, I explore - through various writing and
art formats - a series of desperate tho related concepts 
ranging from cosmology to consciousness and free will.


And I propose and explore some intriguing models
you may want to consider such as regarding time and
how it results in the apparent EPR paradox and, as well,
a structural and mechanistic model for how matter and
mass connect as well as provide some detail on the 
relationships of time/gravity and other forces.



Specifically,


I propose time as a 3-dimensional quasicrystalline net
of collapse events against the fabric of a fully collapsing 
modular host pattern and describe where said pattern resides



I describe how to extract time from the pattern and evolve 
a universe such as ours from a point containing 
modular maths such as elliptics



I propose a unique model for the electron
(and nucleon components) as a resonant folded
wave/anti-wave (4:1 ratio in the electron) pattern in
the motif of a tetrix: a tetrahedral pyramidal fractal fold
of mass/void and the consequences of such regarding
the observed matter dominance in our universe and
its evolution



I describe the w/~w basis of the 3-state equilibrium 
of photon/electron interaction as the tetrix tetrahedral 
fold equilibrates with a cubic fold allowing point collapse 
of part of the electron folded wave and how this yields time 
and the EPR/Bell's inequality observations as waves and 
anti-waves transition through the collapse state and
invert to yield the changed state



I explore how neutrinos may be the mechanism of 
motion/momentum for the folded-matter waves and 
how motion may be realized on a fully collapsing, 
modular host with implications for how gravity 
differs fundamentally from other forces



I elucidate a system - derived from neutrino oscillation
 - detailing how rotational inertia is related and maintained 
relative to linear momentum in a universe where the only force is simplification and describe how momentum is prone to condense with the greater frame of reference



I describe how the universe relies on de-construction
of its core information pattern, where the 'particle' machines ur-data is extracted, sending the information by two mechanisms to distant location and re-combining to yield the collapsible cubic architecture: this results in alteration, temporarily, of the pattern that consequently inflates our universe and this process can occur reversibly without wave inversion beneath the 
time collapse events



I describe entanglement as superposition/co-collapse
of mirrored, adjacent waves thus creating linkage to 
subsequent collapse with inversion required as
observed time events



I propose straight-forward bases for the dark matter
and dark energy observations and describe the cycling
of universe iterations at our local site in the uberverse 
including provenance of the high negative entropy
that is energy



Those are in part I of the book's triptych; if you find
these topics of interest, there are others that I find even
more intriguing in the remainder:



For example, I describe a functional definition of soul and 
point to cryptic components, such as our ur-brain memory: 
a cross-generational repository/information system which 
provides survival utility as a fundamental evolutionary tool



This is interpreted in relation to the concepts of free will/choice



And I introduce potential reasons to question whether digital as fundamentally differing, with relevance, from IRL



Please enjoy as you wont - it is intended purely and simply as art 

and as such, simply and purely to inspire your art


Many thanks for all your good works,

1052,i1ukcp,"I'm not sure if I'm depressed/procrastinating, or actually losing my passion for physics. Anyone ever felt disillusioned with studying physics and got through it?","This is a hard post for me to make, I don't really want to admit to myself that a big part of my identity might have just disappeared, and that I no longer love physics as much as I used to, but the past few weeks especially have been so tough and I'm not sure if I lost my direction in life. I have a feeling like maybe this should be directed to a therapist, but I want to see what the community has to say about it first. Especially if anyone here has suffered from disillusion and managed to get over it somehow.

A summary of my academic career: First I went to college for an unrelated major, and I had to take two physics classes for it. I did take them, and I fell in love with physics. I was so excited and passionate about it, I kept reading books, talking to my professor in office hours, often late into the night, I even tutored other people taking these classes after me. I decided to pursue it for real and I had tremendous support from my professor in this process. So, after 2 years, I transferred to another school where I spend 2.5 years taking all the physics classes for my major. I graduated two years ago. After graduating, I haven't been able to find a job with my degree (still haven't found any), which in itself was a huge hit to my confidence, on top of the imposter syndrome I was suffering from, but my plan was always to go back to grad school (masters), and I knew that going back would help me out, so I didn't completely give up hope for myself. 

However, I am increasingly getting impatient with physics, if that's the right wording. It's like, I know I should be studying for my gre's, maybe doing some programming projects for my portfolio, or compiling notes to study from, but I just don't want to do any of it. It feels boring, and like I just can't be bothered. I've always suffered from procrastination, even in college, so it's nothing new, but at least back then I thought that I loved physics despite the fact that I didn't want to sit down and study, and I still studied enough to get by. Now I'm not so sure. How can I possibly claim I love it if I dread the mere thought of opening a textbook? I still feel like I like physics in itself, the theories are beautiful and I feel emotions I can't describe when I think about it. It's breathtaking and inspiring, it makes me feel alive. But when it comes to opening the textbook or putting on a lecture, picking up the notebook to solve a problem, etc. I just don't feel like doing it. Suddenly this awesome thing becomes ordinary and a chore. I've been going out on walks a lot, taking in the nature, and I just feel like sitting down with a textbook, or the prospect of spending a few years sat down at my desk doing homework, all of a sudden is horrifying to me, even though I used to feel like that was exactly what I wanted. I used to tell my best friend that I wish I could be a forever student, because I loved going to school more than I liked doing anything else. But now I can't even bear to look at the pile of textbooks...

It just feels like life is bigger than that, you know? Like there's only so much time we have on this earth, and so much to take in, so many things to experience, and how can I possibly open a plain old grey textbook and spend hours hunched over it when I could be out, taking in the breeze and feeling alive? Is it depression? Some kind of quarter-life crisis? I don't know. It definitely feels like it. I just don't know if my feelings are true, if pursuing physics further isn't what I want anymore, even though it's all I ever wanted for the past 4 years. I don't know if this is a sign to give up on physics, or something I have to push through.",22,2020-08-01 11:03:11,physics

&amp;#x200B;

I've been reading up on the Greenhouse Effect, especially as it is suggested that the Runaway Greenhouse effect on Venus supports the idea that CO2 is to blame for the GHE. Venus's atmosphere is 96% CO2, and holds 20ppm of water vapour.

However on reading the definitions and requirements for a Runaway GHE, a runaway GH state relies on water vapour escaping to space via HydroDynamic Escape.

But Hydrodynamic escape relies on the atmosphere of the planet to have several conditions :

a calculation called Hydrodynamic flux ""  Hydrodynamic escape [flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux)  in an energy-limited escape can calculated, assuming (1) an atmosphere composed of non-[viscous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity), (2) constant molecular weight gas, with (3) [isotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotropy) pressure, (4) fixed temperature, (5) perfect XUV absorption, and that (6) pressure decreases to zero as distance from the planet increases.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic_escape#cite_note-:12-4) "" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic\_escape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrodynamic_escape) 

&amp;#x200B;

the above linked papers indicate that the lower 7km's of Venus atmosphere is not gaseous, but infact a Supercritical Fluid. 

Am I correct in assuming that a Supercritical Fluid has some viscosity? if so condition 1 of Hydrodynamic Flux calc is **not** met.

If the atmosphere is not all gaseous but partially a SC fluid, then condition 2 is also **not** met.

I'm not sure on condition 4 - all atmospheres over 10kPa have a temperature gradient attributed to auto-adiabatic compression.

&amp;#x200B;

If the conditions for Hydrodynamic flux are not met, then can we state that Water vapour could not escape the atmosphere via the Hydrodynamic escape mechanism? What does this do to Greenhouse effect calculations?

as such does this bring the Greenhouse effect on Venus into question - ?

1105,i18fo8,Why is this different from dark matter? (Help!),"So as I understand it, the search dark matter is predicted by some of our best high level physical theories. As a result, many physicists believe it probably exists, and are willing to spend years, and lots of money, searching for it - despite us (so far) having no actual evidence for it's existence (beyond the theory).

On the other hand, the Drake Equation, coupled with the sheer number of planets in the universe, and the assumption that if we have one data point (earth) it's probably a non-special, average planet - implies that there really should be lots of intelligent life out there (even if it's one in a billion billion, there would still be a lot). Which is captured by the Fermi paradox. However, despite the theory saying that the simplest answer is that intelligent life is commonplace, the search for intelligent life isn't taken seriously by many physicists - to the point where saying any astronomical result could possibly be intelligent life is hugely looked down on, and can even end your career.

Why? Seems to me there are strong parallels with the search for dark matter, where the invisible thing predicted by theory is widely accepted. So why is looking for, or ascribing 'aliens' as a possible answer to a question in physics so taboo? 

(Caveat: I know there are lots of ways to massage the drake equation to make complex life be absurdly rare. That's not my point - I'm really asking why, given the *simple* answer is that intelligent life is commonplace in the galaxy (i.e. we don't have to introduce extra things like rare earth, great filters, etc. to explain why it's not), physics still treats the implication like it's virtually impossible.)",9,2020-07-31 09:27:30,physics

I've found that 1L of water that increases 1°C absorbs 4180J of energy. What I'd like to know is if that 1°C increase comes from the ambient air, by how many degrees can I hope to cool 1m³ of that air ? (of course given that the ambient air is considerably warmer than tap water).

1116,i1582y,Book recommendations?,"Hello! I am 20 years old and I developed a passion for watching science videos online, but **I need more** than what's on the surface of Physics.

I will soon start studying Physics at some University but I want to get deeper than just learning to apply a theorem. I want the full history of a concept. A book that starts from the beginning of Physics and comes to the present. One that contains both history and proper explanation. I'm aware of the magnitude a book like this would have. But I am ready to read as many as I can digest. 

I just don't know where to start. I studied Physics and Mathematics in High school but I don't know how much I don't know.

We know that acceleration has equivalency to gravity by equivalency principle. A rotating energy is equivalent to a mass contributing a gravitational field curving space time in the same way a stationary massive object would.

Nonetheless we know exactly the value of c and we know its fixed number and it wont change no matter how fast you move. Meaning we could shy a laser to all directions and calculate how long it takes to get to its target and then we should get value for XYZ and their will be a different number than the same XYZ going the opposite direction as it will have traveled a shorter distance and then we can calculate how fast we are travelling relative to light instead of to the universe, which should give us the true speed in which we are travelling through space time, right?Unless if the ground moves the same speed no matter which way it goes which doesn’t makes sense as it wont somehow make light go slower and also we have proofs that galaxies get closer to each other faster than the speed of c.

1162,i0l1ss,Is it possible?,"Hello smart redditors! I'm in need for some help.

I've been passionate about scientific things, particularly computers, from a very young age but due some family pressure I had to part my ways with it. So, I took the business part and I'm currently in my second year of undergraduate studies pursuing accounting, finance and economics( I love finance too).

I've been having these thoughts lately that I shouldn't leave what I loved back in time. So, I decided that I'll study physics on my own, only intuitively, if it's possible because I think if I go too deep, I'll neglect my current studies. But if it's not possible to only study intuitively,  I'll study as a physics student does.

I have basic-intermediate math background in calculus and linear algebra. But I don't have any relevant physics background.

I want to study about quantum mechanics/physics  (I don't know if they are similar or not) because I want to study about quantum computers and I recently found out about a connected field of physics and economics/finance, it's called quantum economics/econophysics and I want to know more about these too.

If you guys could help me with what resources I should refer to, what books I need to study and all that stuff.  If it's not possible just to get away with intuition then please refer a full curriculum that can help me in becoming a literate person and make up with myself for not fighting back to chase my dreams.",1,2020-07-30 07:19:02,physics

1170,i0j9w6,"Space is orientation, time is the calculus of orientation","space is orientation when we describe space we describe the orientation in the space. when we change space state we call that distance when we change space state in a constant way we call that velocity. When this is all constant motion we notice no change in orientation of all things moving in unison, however there is a state change in space for the things not in constant motion with that orientation. Time is continuity of orientation change or the derivative of orientation. Time itself is not separate from space it is space and there is no need for spacetime as it is redundant like saying spacespace or timetime. If i moved something say a watermelon instantaneously from x to y there is no time passage therefore no time and no continuity. So time is a continuous change in space the illusion of time comes from the discretization of time which is continuous thus causing a contradiction. Thus time is an illusion as contradictions are impossible. This works in reverse where space is the integral of time. Again ultimately there is no difference here but simply a way of resolving some confusions in teachings. So the relativity that is experienced can be either the dilation of time or the dilation of space because they're actually definitively the exact same thing.

Also on these experiments, I keep seeing a detector drawn as if it could see the photon as it went by.  Wouldn't the photon have to hit a material that can send an electrical signal to indicate it has been detected?

I also keep trying to figure out a way that a person (as a diy project) could emit a single photon and be certain that there is not a lot of them interfering with the experiment.

Anyone have a notion about these things?  I am just a tinkerer and really am not that well educated on these things.

I've been trying to study AP Physics 2 over the summer and Coulomb's Law showed up in the electrostatics unit, what I realized was that it looked eerily similar to the equation that determines the force of gravity between two objects.

If gravity is a result of masses curving spacetime, does electric charge produce a similar effect? If so, why does that force the two charges to gravitate towards each other? Another question I have which I've been having trouble trying to answer is why does mass curve spacetime in the first place? It might be related to the mass-energy equivalence, which I'm reading about right now, but is there a simple intuitive explanation as to why this is the case? In my mind, I visualize space as a 3-dimensional vat where we are free to move and time as a linear expansion of that space. Why does the presence of mass warp that? I've seen the 3-d distortion models of what a presence of mass causes, but I'm just having trouble understanding why it causes a distortion in the first place/ why there is a ""fabric"" to the universe, and why it's not just fundamentally emptiness. If it has to do something with the massive amount of energy that was released as a product of the big bang, with lingering traces of that energy looming in space that'd make sense. But why does the presence of energy as mass distort that?

Say x and y are 1 light year apart. You generate a wave at x that will move y to be 1/2 light year apart.

Assuming:

1. The wave travels at the speed of light
2. When the wave reaches y it's 1/2 light year from x
3. It takes 1 year for the wave to reach y

is a contradiction because if the wave has traveled 1/2 light year in 1 year then it's moved slower than the speed of light.

At some  point you come close to a state where you are so fast that you can't  change the speed you're moving towards the center of the black whole  with, you can't even see anything in front of you or behind you but you  can move on the sphere around the black whole ( \~left/right, \~up down on  the surface of a ball) while heading to the center with a constant  speed and the change of time being approximately zero.

You  now live on a 2d sphere with the direction towards the center being  your new ""time"" (you move through with an approximately constant speed).  The former time dimension has ""stopped"".

I  am pretty sure that this idea is bull crap as physics isn't my field  but do you have an idea why?

1315,hyr3ku,"Reaction rates, the math is easy, but what if it says that you can get more reactions than you have incident particles?","[not a homework question]      
Probably, one of the most simple formula in Physics: reaction rate (s-1.cm-3) = Ф.σ.N , with Ф: neutron flux (neutrons.cm-2.s-1); σ microscopic cross section (cm2); N  atomic number density (atoms.cm-3).    


Say you have a flux Ф = 1000 neutron.cm-2.s-1.    
What is the B10(n,a) reaction rate of a 1 cm3 piece of Boron in such flux?   
σ: [3837b](https://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/cgi-bin/Tab80WWW.cgi?lib=J40&amp;iso=B010) = 3.84E-21 [cm-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit)#Commonly_used_prefixed_versions)      
N: [2.46g.cm-3](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=boron), 19.8% of which are B10, that's [2.2E22 atoms.cm-3](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=atoms+in+%282.46*0.198%29g+of+B-10).    

reaction rate (s-1.cm-3) = 1E3 x  3.84E-21 x 2.2E22 = 8.45E4 s-1.cm-3    

... so each of the 1000 incident neutrons get captured 84 times ??    

How can you score 84 bulls eyes with only one  dart ?

It should demonstrate wave-particle duality by showing the interference pattern that is built as you fire a series of individual electrons through a double slit diffraction grating and onto an electron detector.

Components:

* Electron emitter emitting one electron per second (or roughly on that time scale)
* Double slit diffraction grating
* Electron detector, capable of detecting single electrons striking a 2d plane
* Vacuum enclosure (light-proof too?)

Nice-to-have: Ability to manipulate the experiment, eg replacing slits with detectors/blockers, tweaking parameters of the electron gun

The apparatus should connect to my computer (or have a built-in screen) where I can see the measurements of the electron detector graphed onto a 2d plane.

1377,hxx7j5,HEP Theory Reading Club (UF) -- Standard Model Section,"Hi All,

I am a graduate student in the University of Florida. Several of our students in HEP theory have established a reading club, and we are glad to invite you all.

The goal of our reading club is to read and review the content and the logic of theoretical physics textbooks. Currently, we have reached the Standard Model section of the textbook *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by Schwartz M.D. (As we progress, the material to cover will be more advanced.) This is a fairly new start for those who wish to join.

Our current members have already taken 4-5 semesters of QFT. The fact is, in class and homework the professors have no choice but to focus on the calculation more than the logic. However, when you read through any textbook, there are always some logic chains that are well or ill addressed, but cannot be explained in classes. This is the point we want to cover in the reading club.

Currently, the format of the reading club is members rotating in presenting sections of a chapter in the Schwartz textbook. We are meeting online each week on Tuesday.

Schrodinger_Equation.py: This would contain a Schrodinger_equation class. In the class you'd call Planck's constant and the linear partial differential equation from Resources.py, and then there'd be several different methods for different environments (particle in a box, free particle, etc.)

Using this logic would terminal velocity decrease once again as you reach closer to the Earth’s core or would the effect of gravity be stronger thus not making a difference.,2,2020-07-25 00:43:08,physics

I thought that your skin acts like a capacitor so when plugged into AC it will change and discharge, shocking you, no matter if your grounded or not. 

I don't have any formal education on physics and have never studied it so I'm not really sure.

1441,hxcdlb,Electric field inside a conductor,"I am new to this subreddit so I don't know if this counts as a homework question.

I recently read that if the electrons inside a conductor remain static, then this means that the total electric field at each *point* inside the conductor (excluding holes in the material of the conductor) is zero, because if it wasn't zero the electrons would move around. How is that? I would find it logical to say that the field is zero at every position inside the conductor where an electron is located (since we use an electron's movement or static state as a test), but in a position where there is no electron how can we know that the field there is zero? I know that there is an infinite amount of electrons inside a conductor but there is an even ""more infinite"" amount of *positions* (i.e. points). 

To say that the electric field is zero at every *point* inside the conductor judging by the immobility of electrons can only be an estimate/approximation, right? Or am I missing something?",8,2020-07-24 18:28:18,physics

These terms are not used jokingly as he is visibly upset his predictions are wrong and I feel he truly seeks to discredit this objective knowledge as nonsense. 

He constantly points to classical physics and it’s deterministic properties as the basis for all of physics and how there is nothing else. When I try to explain to him even simply that the LED TV we use to watch it is a direct consequence of Quantum and not Newton. I try to do some of the math and explain it as it comes in the video but this falls on deaf ears.

I again ask him questions like “so do atoms exist?” And he says this is a stupid question and will not humor me with a response. This hurts me, these principles and discoveries are why I even have a subject to study in university— I’m a Chemistry Major. He may not realize it directly but he’s basically shitting on my whole interest of science by discrediting it as voodoo because Einstein didn’t like “spooky action”.",598,2020-07-22 22:51:13,physics

1769,htahlo,May 2020 Physics graduate: My experience job hunting and getting my first job during covid,"Hello  all, I am 24 years old, I  just recently graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with a  degree in Physics and a math minor. I had a lot of decisions to make  when leading up to my final semester, and seeing as I was burnt out on  the academic life and being broke my entire 6 years of undergrad (took  me awhile to figure out what I wanted to do) I decided that I would go  into the workforce. I absolutely loved my degree, I definitely would not  have chosen a different path. Physics gave me the ability to  practically learn and do anything. It gave me a deep understanding for  the world around me and how to apply myself to learn deep and complex  topics. I started my job search around December 2019. I mainly applied  to engineering/lab roles in various private companies. I probably  applied to about 50-60 jobs by the time March came around. I had a  friend who was also a physics major who graduated about a year and a  half before me and I knew he was working in a CS job somewhere so I hit  him up and asked about his company and how he enjoyed it. I had done  some python coding in my physics degree but nothing to the degree of  full on software and application development, mainly just scientific  programming.

The job was for  private company who is a DoD contractor making classified ISR  (Intelligence, surveillance and Reconnaissance) for various military  branches and secret military units and their aircraft. During college I  actually went to Officer Candidate School for the Marine Corps to try  and become a pilot (which ended up not working out due to medical  issues) the job sounded extremely interesting to me. Only problem was  that I didn't know how to code. He said that they worked in .NET and C#  was the language of choice and sorta gave me some advice on things I  should learn if I were to apply. I applied for a junior developer  position and he was able to give me a recommendation. For the next 3  months I did nothing but learn to code all day. I got access to plural  sight and grinded out all I could and making my own small apps (I made a  unit conversion app that took user input and converted things like  mass, temperature, energy etc) . I also made a few contributions to an  open source physics project that I found on GitHub like a complex number  class, and various other things. I didn't hear back from the company  for about a month.

I finally got a  phone call to schedule the initial HR interview which was just your  basic ""tell me about yourself"" and ""why do you want to work for this  company"" etc. That info was then passed on to the manager of  engineering, and I was scheduled for a technical interview with her and  two other developers. At this point I had been studying strictly .NET  and C# and WPF application development (which is what they mainly use)  for about 4 months. I felt completely prepared for the interview and was  able to answer most of their questions. They liked what I had to say  and I made it to a final ""culture fit"" interview with about 7-8 people  total including the program manager. This was actually more relaxed than  the technical interview and they mainly just wanted me to ask them  questions and let the team get to know me more and see if they like me.  Well, as the title says they decided to hire me and I moved to the  Nashville area and started my job as a software engineer as of June  15th. They offered me a starting salary of $76,500 with a $5000 starting  bonus. (I was offered another job down in Mississippi for $40k doing  acoustic modelling for the navy, but decided not to take it).

Safe  to say that I do not regret my choice  (yet haha) and I am loving the  software world so far. I did not take any coding courses in college, and  they do give me some on the job training. The first month has been  essentially working through different exercises that teach me the coding  practices and software architecture and patterns and principles they  use, as well as getting used to WPF. I will finally be able to touch the  code base starting next week. Excited and nervous but the team I've  been working with has been extremely helpful and always has answered my  questions no matter how simple they might have been. I feel extremely  grateful to have such a great job during this whole COVID-19 crisis.  Since the government relies on our software they consider us essential,  and so we've actually be hiring a ton of people and have not let anyone  go during this whole thing. Many of the employees have been her for 7-10  years so it definitely seems like a stable job which seems rare in this  field.

I just wrote this not to  brag, but to simply share my experience during this whole thing. Out of  those 50-60 jobs I applied to I only got interview for 3 and rejected or  ghosted by the rest. It's really tough out there. The connections I  made in college though ended up paying off. Use those if you have them.",11,2020-07-17 23:17:01,physics

motion and came up with a theoretical system that in my mind doesn't

seem to obey the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy and

newton's law of every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9nldvjaqzab51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c8842062bdf154247354bdbe688f93d64f5d3e12

   
[Youtube video demo](https://youtu.be/qZt5wZuEOTI)

&amp;#x200B;

I came up with the idea of a system inside a system, where a force

on the outer system has an impact on the inner system but a force

applied to the inner system doesn't have an impact on the outer system.

&amp;#x200B;

The first outer system is composed of a piston that compresses and

decompresses butane contained in a chamber in the most efficient way

possible using as little friction as possible.

In this outer system the force of decompression of the butane is

harnessed to recompress the butane so as that no force other than the

force needed to overcome the systems friction is needed for the compression

and decompression of the butane to take place.

The outer system compresses the butane to its liquid state and

decompresses it to its gas state over and over again.

&amp;#x200B;

The second inner system is composed of a float contained within the

butane that floats upwards when the butane is in its liquid state

and sinks downwards when the butane is in its gas state.

&amp;#x200B;

This is the part where I struggle to understand how the laws of physics

apply to the buoyant force acting on the float moving up and down in my

mind the float reacts to the force of the first systems compression and

decompression but the first system doesn't react to the float moving up

and down in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

So does this mean that energy could be harnessed from the float moving up

and down without any additional energy required for the compression and

decompression of the butane from gas to liquid state? I think so

&amp;#x200B;

If the losses of energy due to entropy of the inner and outer system

are smaller than the archimedes force acting on the float of the inner

system an over unity force would be possible!

&amp;#x200B;

F(overunity) = F(Archimedes) - F(entropy)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

If the losses of energy due to entropy of the inner and outer systems are

greater than the archimedes force acting on the float especially due

to the friction of the butane molecules rubbing together and the design

of the piston, the force might not be great enough for over unity but in

my mind the harnessable archimedes force generated from repetitive

compression and decompression of the butane proves to be an additional

force created from a one way reaction due to the compression and

decompression of the butane.

This would therefore in my mind violate Newton's law of every action

has an equal and opposite reaction and also violate the first law of

thermodynamics as the conservation of energy in this system would not

apply

This reminded me of a long standing question I have about this process and space-time distortions: if it is space-time itself that is being distorted, how can the victim notice it? From their point of view nothing changed, they are still moving along a straight space-time line, at the same speed. Its the ""1m"" and/or ""1s"" that changed from an outsider's perspective. Shouldn't the whole spaghettification process be imperceptible to the victim?

1830,hs8x6i,Am I doing the wrong PhD? I really need some advice,"First of all, sorry if this is slightly off-topic; I wasn't sure where else to post and I thought physics might be a good place for this discussion.  


I've been working on my PhD project in Metamaterials for almost a year now. I have a great supervisor, I'm in a good school and the project is, on paper, really interesting. However, ever since starting the project I've felt like a bit of a bad fit. My first degree was in Physics, and my second in Fluid Dynamics. I'm now based in Applied Maths, rather than in the Physics department, and sometimes I don't feel quite up to scratch on the maths skills and applications.  I also feel like the project is really dry, and I wouldn't say that I'm particularly passionate about it. My results haven't been great so far and I think my supervisor would be better off with a different student.

This project was offered to my cohort of postgrads as one of a possible 15, and at the time I just picked the project which I thought I would enjoy the most. Sadly, I haven't really been enjoying it (which I know is quite normal for a PhD) and I frequently think about the other projects I could have done. When I look back, I think I made all the right choices, but I'm not happy now with what I'm working on or the direction I'm going in.  


What eats away at me most is the fact that I'm not working in a research area I'd like to pursue after completing the PhD. I LOVE science, but my interests are primarily in space physics, exoplanets, space weather, etc. I feel like doing a project in these areas would suit me better, and point me in a research direction I'm more interested in. There are still a couple projects at my university that are open to candidates this October, and I've been thinking about applying every day.  


But what would my supervisor think if I dropped this project? Would I get along with my new supervisor? Would I like my new project after a year of working on it? How much longer will it take to finish it? If I stick with my current project, I'll be done in 2 years and I'll only be 26 when it's done, whereas if I pick a new project it could be 4 years and I'll be 28/turning 29! Could I go into space/atmospheric physics or research with my PhD in applied maths? Will it be hard to apply for a new PhD if my potential supervisor knows I've dropped this one? Will they have faith in me?  


All of this is making me feel like a massive failure, and an idiot for picking a project that I don't enjoy so much. I worked so hard through 5 years of undergrad and postgrad just to get here, and now I don't know if I want to stick with it.  


TL;DR: I'm doing metamaterials, I think I should be in space and atmospheric physics instead. I don't know what to do and I feel like a failure/an idiot. Any advice?",28,2020-07-16 07:41:58,physics

But what confuses me is why the potential energy does not change along the length of conductor. If the negative terminal is high potential and the positive terminal is low potential, then it must require some amount of energy to push it from positive to negative.
And if voltage is equal to the energy required to push it that distance, but also equal to the field strength times distance, shouldn't it require half as much energy to push an electron half the length of the wire? Then as a result shouldn't the potential energy move linearly downwards as you move from the negative end to the positive end.

Maybe something I'm struggling with is to whether two parallel plates have a high potential (for an electron) at the negative end and a low potential at the positive end. [Like in two parallel plates.](http://imgur.com/gallery/T699sEr)",22,2020-07-15 07:14:15,physics

I've applied for the list of classes this year but am having some second doubts. 

Basically, I'm not really into the sciences, but need to take one full year course in order to meet graduation requirements. But, I ended up signing up for 2 science courses because of pressure from my parents. Now, I'm making a stand for myself and instead replacing one of them with a social science course on my own. 

So I'm stuck between dropping AP Biology, and a college-level course on Computational Physics. I don't have a particular passion for either, but I still need to take one of them. 

I've finished geometry and Algebra2/Trig so far, with decent but not stellar grades(B+, occasionally Bs and As), and was wondering how hard this course would be for me? I have very little prior experience in coding. 

Description: 

""Computational Physics is an introductory college-level course in physics that will also incorporate coding using vPython and mathematical modeling using Excel. The first three quarters of the year will be dedicated to learning the introductory concepts ideas of classical mechanics as well as an introduction to coding. Students will learn physics theory, perform experiments, and compare their experimental results to the data predicted via modeling. The last quarter of the year is dedicated to individualized, student-initiated, and designed advanced projects using and applying the physics and computer-generated data.""

Boring details for those who are actually interested: I'd prefer to start off with two meetings per week (one math session and one physics session) via Zoom, and see how it goes from there. What I'm looking for is someone who can teach me quantum mechanics in a rigorous yet intuitive way (as far as qm can be intuitive). I have a solid knowledge of linear algebra, although we may have to recall some concepts I haven't worked with in a while. I'm hoping this will be fun for both of us - I simply want to understand what's going on, so I'll also do my homework and read up on relevant material in between meetings. This is also how I like to teach others - I have some experience as a tutor and I think there should be a healthy mix of intuition and rigour. I don't want to be the only one benefiting from this, so I really hope some of you are interested in learning some math topic you never had the chance to delve into and would like to go on this journey with me.
I'm a 22-year old male, in case that matters.

And this is one thing that really bugs me: I've never understood why it is a big deal that information is apparently destroyed inside a black hole... Why information cannot be destroyed? Why is it a ""paradox""?

Information getting destroyed is something we see everyday! Whether ""information"" is an object, or a set of objects set in a specific order to create information, all these can be destroyed! That's what entropy is about! when you burn a CD, you destroy that information, and there is no way to retrieve it back! The only way to retrieve it is that you kept a perfect mapping and perfect tracking of every atom in the CD... and that's a big ""if"". Because that's the exact flaw that I see in the statement ""information cannot be destroyed"": **information doesn't persist without work! You need to do work just to preserve information.** So why on earth do scientists go around saying something that is clearly false?

I get it that this violates some principles of Quantum Mechanics. But guess what, Quantum Mechanics is a model to understand the world and not the other way around. If entropy and information getting destroyed are incompatible with Quantum Mechanics, then **why don't scientists jus accept that Quantum Mechanics has it's limits?**

The author uses [Feynman path integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation) to work out the double-slit experiment, and *gets a different answer than what wavefunction superposition predicts*.

&amp;#x200B;

[The discrepancy comes from electron paths like these, which are not accounted for in the usual picture, but definitely do contribute to the final probability distribution.](https://preview.redd.it/pvgs7onwsda51.png?width=413&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c0c842c4fbe67f56d8ddd7af25550a49f029b63)

If you’re curious, look to page 166 for the correction terms, ψ\_1’ and ψ\_2’. The complete probability function is on page 169, along with an experimental prediction. Notations are defined by figure 2.

**From the introduction:**

&gt;The interference experiment done by Young with the experimental arrangement of Figure 1 clearly showed the wave nature of light. The same type of experiment with an electron beam indicates that electrons have the property of wave in accordance with the prediction of quantum mechanics: The wave function ψ for Figure 1a is the sum of the two wave functions ψ\_1 and ψ\_2 corresponding to the situation of Figures 1b and 1c, respectively,  
&gt;  
&gt;ψ = ψ\_1 + ψ\_2     (1)  
&gt;  
&gt;This equality (1) is often stated as an example of the superposition principle of quantum mechanics.  
&gt;  
&gt;Strictly speaking, however, the wave functions ψ, ψ\_1, and ψ\_2 are the solutions of the Schrödinger equation with different boundary conditions; they correspond to the experimental arrangements of Figures 1a, 1b, and 1c, respectively. Therefore, the wave functions ψ, ψ\_1, and ψ\_2 belong to different Hilbert spaces, and equation (1) does not hold in a rigorous sense.

Oh. Huh. So. You can’t just take a linear combination of Electrons In An Experiment With One Slit, add that (*somehow*) to a linear combination of Electrons In An Experiment With A Slit At A Different Spot, and expect to get Electrons When There’s Two Slits. That's what it's saying?

Have all those explanations I’ve read been lying?

What details did they gloss over that I didn’t realize? What, precisely, is incorrect about the picture of P(x) = |ψ\_1(x) + ψ\_2(x)|²?

2046,hpmtrl,How would go about changing the emission spectra of hot-electron relaxation?,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I asked a question earlier in regards to how an extremely low energy(infared-radio range) frequency emission spectrum possible. It was mentioned in an answer to that post that excited electrons become ""hot"" if sufficiently excited, and they exit the edge of the conduction band. After this happens, the de-excitation often happens in a bunch of small band transitions, resulting in a frequency emitted of infared frequency or lower. 

As it turns out, it is a higher frequency that people are aiming for in hot-electron relaxation because this way, the energy(in the case of photovoltalic cells) can be reused if it is a high enough energy(that does not result in the vibration of the lattice work and cause energy wastage through heat). I know that this has not fully been accomplished yet, but there are some promising studies in regards to AFSnI3 emitting frequencies in the blue range under certain conditions. 

Anyway, I have another thing in mind: Instead of reusing this higher-frequency radiation to produce more energy in this manner, why not go the other direction and produce a lower frequency band from hot electron relaxation? Why don't we leverage the relative nearness of radio/ELF frequencies instead of trying to reconvert higher frequencies in the case of relaxation? After all, if a lower frequency is used, then less energy overall would be used in the process of dissipating that difference. What I mean is this: Let's say radio waves, being a lower energy, have a value of 1. Maybe ultraviolet has a value of 10. Green has a value of 7. Of course, this is speaking pretty vaguely; I'm not actually using accurate proportionate examples of energy. Anyway, ultraviolet excites this material, that only needs the excitation energy of green light. This material cannot possibly produce another green photon, because  7 does not divide into 10 twice(energies of green and ultraviolet, respectively). So why not instead reuse this green as it should be, and instead convert that excess energetic value of three into three radio/ELF waves? After doing this, we can directly convert this radiation with a coil. Long story short, I think it would make much more sense to convert to a lower frequency than a higher one.

That being said, I'm not sure how you would go about doing so. I heard that the bandgap changes with temperature, but as far as the hot electron transition step goes, I have no idea what determines it.

How could the 'steps' of energy reduction in the case of a hot electron be reduced? How would one go about engineering a material to behave this way? Does it already happen? Are there some materials that would have hot electrons emit radio waves returning to ground state, or the conduction band?

This is all coming from someone young and inexperienced in this field; I'm not pretending to know more than I do. I'll admit I'm not particularly knowledgeable on physics in general: I've only really looked into much about semiconductors very recently.

I posted two similar(but not the same question) posts that were both removed. If you are a moderator reading with the intention to do so, please tell me why and don't just remove me for some vague reason. It makes for a healthier community when people know more specifically what rules they violated in a removed post.

Time itself may be just a dimension like space and it so happens that our brains have evolved the capability of creating consciousness only if we move in one direction of that dimension. It would be like the expierience of falling down - it is only created when you're moving down. 

But what if there was life that would evolve the other way? Life that would expierience things moving back in time. It does not violate the rules of thermodynamics as this life would increase increase its entrophy only when moving back in time.

Perhaps there already exist such systems but we just never notice that.

This would be a kind of reverse evolution system. 
It does not have to be life. It may be a simpler system but do they exist?

If this is the case, then why would adding mass change anything about the point? If the point is infinitely dense and is literally a single point, then adding any finite amount of matter shouldn't change it, kind of like if I added 10 to infinity, it is still infinity. Clearly black holes must hold some sort of information about the amount of mass they have taken in though, because that sum determines the diameter of their event horizon? If it is truly infinitely dense though, why is there not just a universal diameter for event horizons, like a physical constant or something?

2069,hpessi,Am I confused or is this khan academy video very misleading about Reynold’s number?,"The two min Khan Academy video defines the critical velocity of a fluid to be equal to:

(Reynold’s number * viscosity of fluid) / (2*density*radius of tube)

The video says that this equation will give you a “critical velocity” of a fluid and once the fluid reaches this velocity, it could experience turbulent (disordered) flow opposed to laminar (ordered) flow.

Therefore, if you increase Reynold’s number, the fluid will need to flow faster in order to become turbulent. 

Thus, this implies that at higher Reynold’s numbers, laminar flow is more likely to occur since the fluid will need to flow faster in order to become turbulent.

However, everywhere else on the internet says that turbulent flow is more likely at higher Reynold’s numbers. Am I being dumb or is the khan academy video wrong?

2086,hp9vt9,How can the band gap stability of a semiconducting material be increased?," 

Hello everyone,

I am not particularly knowledgeable on this subject, so forgive me if the answer to this question is really obvious.

I'm curious as to how one would go about engineering a semiconductor with an extremely narrow band gap, on the order of 10-12 eV/ 1.0 pV. Obviously this seems like a humanly possible level of precise engineering, but if a semiconductor could be used that already has a low bandgap, and then some sort of operation/conditions could be applied to it to increase stability, then(this is extremely wishful thinking), perhaps the bandgap could be varied to that level of precision with temperature?

Does the stability of a bandgap increase with pressure or any other variables?

How would one go about decreasing the temperature dependence of bandgap in a solid semiconductor material?

In case your wondering as to what the practical application of such a material would be, it has to do with power generation. If a semiconductor with a bandgap energy difference of that amount could be found, then wouldn't it's emission spectrum include radiation of it's bandgap energy? I am also confused as to the exact relation between bandgap and emission spectrum. If I'm not mistaken, bandgap is the energy difference between the valance and conduction band that determines the amount of energy required to initiate an excited state? Wouldn't that energy difference, upon decay into ground state, cause the emission of radiation at the corresponding energy difference? So if there was such a material with absorption spectra including radiation well over 1.0 tHz frequency, couldn't that radiation be absorbed into such a material, sending it into an excited state and causing it to emit lower frequency radio/elf radiation? And this radiation, in turn, could be used to induce a current in a coil and in turn provide practical power generation.

Thanks and all response is much appreciated,

I started taking a physics class in college, when doing the homework I feel like I semi understand it and can figure out what to do. I’ve been preparing for a big midterm Monday and the problems are much more tricky and confusing. Or maybe it’s just me. I feel like I take hours to do the homework when other people just spend an hour max (that could also be due to breaks I take in between though and some messing around). I look at my these exam problems and my mind is blank, I literally don’t even know where to begin. I have to look at the answer key to make sense of it, but that’s not really learning it if I’m looking at the answer.

I’ve always felt this way with math in general to be honest. I got all As in high school but our math department was a joke. I got 2 Cs in calc and a B + in stats. I always feel like I freeze at basic math, and I just freak out and my brain shuts down. I don’t know if this is just my weird natural response or if it’s due to when I was younger and I’d ask my dad for help on math homework (hes an engineer and very smart). He’d end up getting frustrated and yell at me and my sister. Homework time always ended in tears. 

In general though, I always feel like my mind is blank. I know that sounds weird, but it’s like I’m devoid of a voice until I consciously make the effort. It’s like I’ll look at nature and my head will be empty unless I make the conscious effort to question my surroundings. I don’t know if this is normal or not. I do feel that I’m a tad slow, I’m gullible in sarcasm and humor, and I tend to blurt our stupid things because I don’t THINK before I speak. 

On the whole I feel like a very dull and empty person. I’ve felt this way a lot of my life, like I’m just a shell. I’m just existing. I feel like there should be some spark in me, some natural curiosity and I should be wondering and thinking things all the time, but most of the time my mind is blank and I’m on autopilot. 

I’m already on antidepressants, and this feeling/ thinking process I can remember back to elementary school. I did go through some rough shit, but I feel like it shouldn’t be an excuse for the way I am. I try to consciously make an effort to think about things and notice things but my natural tendency is nothing.

I'm sorry if this is not the correct place to post this.  I recently stumbled upon a podcast which I do not want to link to, but also a snippet from a book called ""The thought that changed my life forever"". In the podcast and this book, both imply that electrons appear only when a person is measuring or observing the electron.

The person in the podcast I listened to said and I quote ""only when an observer focuses their attention on any location of an electron would it suddenly magically appear."" They then go on to explain how because of this we can create any reality we can think of. Is it accurate to say that the electrons magically appear?

In the book, from the first few paragraphs [here](https://books.google.ca/books?id=NlQF_eCGgZEC&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=electrons+exist+in+a+invisible+field+of+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jGOhlqCT47&amp;sig=ACfU3U2MAWHSB0W9Z8TIiisy3-hhKdXt0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7i_GLoMPqAhVQn-AKHSSND08Q6AEwC3oECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false),  it says ""our subjective minds produce measurable changes on the objective world! At the sub-atomic level, energy responds to our mindful attention and becomes matter. It's scientific fact.""

Am I completely mistaken or have both individuals misunderstood what the observer effect is? The observer is not a subjective mind or the person attempting to look at/measure the electron, but the measuring device itself, is it not? The measuring device interacts with and alters the state of what they measure, which then leads into superposition and the uncertainty principle when it comes to quantum mechanics.",10,2020-07-10 14:07:01,physics

Therefore I do not believe that we can say Einstein rings are evidence of gravitational lensing because I am unconvinced that we have properly ruled out the possibility that Einstein rings are cause by the lensing effects of regular matter.
* When it comes to the gravitational lensing effects of the Sun, it has to be done during solar eclipses to be able to see the star on around the sun.
   * I have not found a single paper so far that explains this phenomenon and factors out the lensing effects of the solar atmosphere as well as the lensing effects of the interface between the heliopause and the interstellar medium
* No interferometry please. Light interferometry is a hyper-sensitive process that can be used to measure and study a large range of various phenomena. If you're going to link me to interferometry based evidence, it'll probably be LIGO. I am unconvinced that LIGO is anything other than a really expensive way to get confirmation bias. I know and understand that LIGO detected something that seemed to correlated with a gamma ray burst, but considering the range of phenomena that can effect light interferometry, I am unconvinced that what was detected was gravitational waves and not something else.",10,2020-07-10 09:48:41,physics

2138,hopxme,Recommendations to get started with physics for a 30 year old programmer?,"Hello everybody on /r/Physics, I want to start off my post with an apology if this is yet another question on recommendations for books you are looking at or if I have violated any of the norms related to posting questions unknowingly. I did go through previous questions in the catalog but I guess my situation is a little different than the questions I have been looking at. It will be great if I could get some insight from people who have much more experience in physics than I do to begin yet another adventure in physics :).

To begin the post here is a little background about myself -:

1. I am 30 year old
2. I am a programmer working for a company (mostly spend time writing code)
3. I have had experience with studying physics previously (as part of my high school curriculum to crack some entrance examinations)
4. I have only figured out a little late in life how curious I am about the world and nature in general.
5. And only lately realized how physics could help me understand things a little better.
6. Back in high school I was never good at physics, I was able to score well but I guess I wasn't able to understand all the concepts properly.

Now a little about what I am looking to do -:

1. I want to get back to studying physics from the ground up (concepts like kinematics, work, energy etc... and just want to know more in general on anything I can lay my hands on)
2. I need to start somewhere and hence looking for some book recommendations. (After some research I came across this book named **Halliday, Resnick and Walker** but I would love to know more references in terms of video, text, books, articles etc... anything that can help me gain some vigor about the subject)
3. I would like to think that I am good at math as I always have scored well in math both in high school, college and my masters degree. (Agreed, I a very rusty currently w.r.t advanced math skills that might be required but I would like to think that I can pick them up along the way. Any references here would be of great help :).)

P.S.: Last but not the least I would like to ask all of you if attempting to regain my interest in the subject a little too late at this age. I believe most people do most of their fascinating work in the field when they start out young. I think I am not studying with the attempt to shatter the world with ground breaking physics and coming up with something really original. But I do want to go through text and content that has been thought, organized and produced over the years by other brilliant minds to understand the world a bit better.",9,2020-07-10 09:30:39,physics

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8GqaAp3cGs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8GqaAp3cGs)   


(I think) I understand everything but I'm still struggling with the symmetry:

As mentioned in the video, you could say that the space ship is standing still and it's the earth that moves. However, it is the person on board of the spaceship that has aged slower when she arrives at the second planet (5,5 years compared to 11 years for person on earth). Now I understand this is because of length contraction.

&amp;#x200B;

Now my question is:

&amp;#x200B;

Image if an alien flies by the earth at 86,6% C as mentioned on the video and travels to the planet 10 lightyears away. At the opposit side of the earth, another alien ship is travelling towards earth at 86,6%C and is 10 lightyears away (as observed from person on the earth).

Now from the perspective of the alien on board the first spaceship passing earth, it will observe a distance of 20 lightyears between the earth/itself and the second spaceship if I'm not mistaken?

&amp;#x200B;

Now from the observer on earth, after 5,75 years, the first spaceship will be halfway between the two planets, and the second spaceship will be halfway from earth. Another 5,75 years later, the first spaceship will reach the remote planet at the same time as the second spaceship reaches earth.

&amp;#x200B;

From the perspective of the alien on board the first spaceship, the distance between the second spaceship and earth is 20 lightyears as I mentioned. Because of time dilation, it only sees a distance of 5 lightyears between itself and the remote planet. So after 5,75 years, it reaches the remote planet while the seconds spaceship is still longway from earth.

Where is the error in my reasoning, or does this mean that the observer on earth and the alien on the first spaceship disagree on the simultaneousness of the two events (first and second spaceship arriving at respectively the remote planet and earth?)

2214,ho0xx4,Black Holes Theory,"Hello everyone. So I am not a scientist or anything, but I like reading a lot about physics and making my own theories. I had a interesting idea about black holes, but I wasn't sure with whom to talk about it, so I am very glad I found this subreddit and look forward to your insights!

So this is the idea:
Black holes are described as objects with a HUGE amount of mass. But what if black holes are actually the opposite: no amount of mass at all? 
By that I mean, could black holes literally be ""cracks"" (or holes) in space time? 
I thought, it could be that what we see (or don't see) in a black hole is actually the nothingness which is filled by our universe and we see (or again, don't see) what was there before the universe.
If you think about it, black holes behave like actual holes in a lot of ways.
-They dissapear over time (the hole filling up again with space and mass?)
-Nothing can escape them (there can be no time in nothingness.)
And the radius in which they attract things is actually not that big for an object that huge (I am not to sure about that, but I think it has a pretty small radius compared to some other objects). So what if the objects that fall victim to black holes do not gravitate towards them, but rather ""fall through"" them?

Black holes are created by objects having huge amounts of mass. What if at a certain point these objects actually are so huge, that even space can't hold them and they just sort of crack it open?

I'm a rising senior in HS (also a girl) and I'm planning on majoring in physics when I get to university. 

Some background.
I have taken physics since my freshman year, currently taking Advanced physics. And honestly, I struggled a lot in physics, more than I care to admit. It was really tough for me to understand. The main reason being the fact that I wasn't taking the required math course for that class. Dumb I know, but I still was able to get an A, all while I was teaching myself the necessary math. As of right now, I'm studying for the upcoming year, however that may look like, I want to be prepared for it. Ever since middle school, math has always been my thing, even when I've struggled to a point of just straight up crying trying to solve a problem I would now find very easy. Every time I would complete a question I would feel so much happiness and just being proud of myself (still do even when taking higher calculus classes). It's something I love so I figured physics would fit me. (I'm not quite sure about it tho). Really quick, during my HS, I've been exposed to the whole male dominated side of things, luckily I've grown accustomed to it, hopefully that will make it an easier transition if I do major in physics.

So here's my question with a little context.
I've read a lot about people having burnouts and practically giving up during their uni. I don't want that to be me since I don't have the funds to mess up in my decision making. I have one shot at this and I want to make sure it's the correct one. I've also read that being a woman in engineering or STEM is no easy task since it's mainly male dominated. As I said before, I've grown somewhat accustomed to that sort of environment. Regardless, there's a big difference between hs and uni. 
Which brings up my question(s). (If you read this far, thank you!) After reading that, would you say that I have a good shot at a physics major? Have you personally seen how difficult it is for anyone (male or female) in this kind of field? What are some of the biggest obstacles you or someone you knew had to face to make it? Is majoring in physics worth it in the end?

I chose the answer that said, ""(+) entropy change for Experiment A, (-) entropy change for Experiment B."" However, the correct answer is ''(+) entropy change for Experiment B, no entropy change for Experiment B."" 

Can someone explain why there is no entropy change in Experiment B with the oil and water? The book's explanation is that the initial and final states of the two substances did not change, as they didn't mix. But the way I see it, there's less volume for the water to occupy than initially, because the oil is also now in the container.

I am not particularly knowledgeable on this subject, so forgive me if the answer to this question is really obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious as to how one would go about engineering a semiconductor with an extremely narrow band gap, on the order of 10^(-12)   eV/ 1.0 pV. Obviously this seems like a humanly possible level of precise engineering, but if a semiconductor could be used that already has a low bandgap, and then some sort of operation/conditions could be applied to it to increase stability, then(this is extremely wishful thinking), perhaps the bandgap could be varied to that level of precision with temperature?

Does the stability of a bandgap increase with pressure or any other variables?

How would one go about decreasing the temperature dependence of bandgap in a solid semiconductor material?

In case your wondering as to what the practical application of such a material would be, it has to do with power generation. If a semiconductor with a bandgap energy difference of that amount could be found, then wouldn't it's emission spectrum include radiation of it's bandgap energy? I am also confused as to the exact relation between bandgap and emission spectrum. If I'm not mistaken, bandgap is the energy difference between the valance and conduction band that determines the amount of energy required to initiate an excited state? Wouldn't that energy difference, upon decay into ground state, cause the emission of radiation at the corresponding energy difference? So if there was such a material with absorption spectra including radiation well over 1.0 tHz frequency, couldn't that radiation be absorbed into such a material, sending it into an excited state and causing it to emit lower frequency radio/elf radiation? And this radiation, in turn, could be used to induce a current in a coil and in turn provide practical power generation.

I'm currently enrolled in a top 10 public university, and ill be starting school in August. I know getting into a good graduate program is to do research; however, I won't even take physics one till spring, and by the end of my sophomore year, I'll be taking modern physics, which usually is when people start research. That seems too long for me, and I want to begin research as soon as I can. I've gone through an AP physics one and two books and did practice problems and took notes, and now I'm working through a calc three program and trying to learn computational skills with python. Is there a way I can start physics research with these skills (seeing that they are self-taught and not formal). How do I show someone I am willing to partake in research.

2273,hnc3ut,The Hardest Problem,"I was reading a book by Prof Sean M Carroll "" Something Deeply Hidden"". I have shared what I have understood.

We still tend to privilege what we see, over what we have.
Nature is fundamentally quantum mechanical from the start. So in some sense, you should be starting with a wave function thought of as a vector in some abstract Hilbert space and deriving the rest of the world.​​

QUANTUM GRAVITY

Gravity has resisted ""quantization"".
Einstein: Gravity is the curvature of spacetime.

We dont have a good quantum theory of gravity itself. For, electromagnetism, the nuclear forces, particles that we know about, electrons and quarks and so forth you start with a classical theory, you quantize it, you get reasonable answer. The above statement works for every forces and every piece of matter in nature other than gravity. For gravity, the best classical theory is Einstein's general theory of relativity which is, that gravity is a feature of spacetime itself. Spacetime curves and warps and responds to matter and energy. But when we put the gravity in a black box and we try to quantize it, it doesn't work.

The best possible way is,  gravity in the sense of starting with some classical model and turning it into a quantum theory. Start with some quantum theory and finding gravity within it.

QUANTUM FIELD THEORY

In modern physics, everything is fields. Even particles, matter like electrons, quarks, neutrinos, there are fields that fill all of space, and what we perceive as particle is really a vibration in that field. So, the fundamental ingredients of nature are fields filling space vibrating in certain ways, in a quantum mechanical framework, the whole thing is called a quantum field theory.

In quantum field theory, empty space is a busy place. When you say space is empty what you really mean is, fields are there but they are in their lowest energy state, they are in their Vacuum state.
 There is a feature you can find in quantum field theory that different regions of space, the fields are vibrating there, are entangled with each other and the amount of entanglement is related to the distance between them, to the geometry of space itself. If two regions of space are nearby, they will be highly entangled and this is the conventional story of quantum field theory. 

WE CANT PUT SPACE IN, WE HAVE TO FIND IN THE WAVE FUNCTION.

The suggestion: we can turn this idea around, the relationship between geometry and entanglement, rather than saying, when two parts of space are close together they are highly entangled, we say, when two quantum parts of Hilbert space are highly entangled, they are close together, that's what it means to be close together and if we do that to all the parts of wave functions, a geometry emerges on space, it's a kind of 3 dimension we live in.

There is also a relationship between entanglement and energy, in the vacuum there is a very specific entanglement structure in quantum field theory. If you want to put a particle somewhere, so you want to add some energy to a region of space by putting a particle there-  you basically have to break the entanglement of that little vibrating quantum field with the rest of it's surroundings. So you decrease the amount of entanglement in a region, and you add energy and vice-versa. 

We understood that there is a relationship between entanglement and geometry and between entanglement and energy so, we have a relationship between geometry and energy and that relationship is nothing but The Theory of General Relativity:
which says, energy causes spacetime to curve.

Rather than postulating Einstein's equation, we can derive it using entanglement. 
The curved geometry of spacetime can emerge naturally from the wave function.",6,2020-07-08 01:39:01,physics

Disclaimer: I might be way off in my understanding, just trying to lay it out how I am thinking.

Ok so in my head it starts out with the wave function of a fermion which is something like a map from ℝ3 -&gt; ℤ1 and squaring/complex-conjugating at each point in space gives you a probability density.

Ok, then they say the phase of the probability amplitude can be arbitrarily shifted anywhere in that wave function and it wont change anything observable, or the lagrangian stays the same, so the particle “moves” the same... which basically means the probability distribution you get won’t be affected... but that makes sense if the probability density is just the magnitude of the complex value...

And then there’s something about how there needs to be a way for any two points in space to compare their wavefunction/complex values... maybe because like the complex values continuously follow a wave pattern through space and end up overlapping... er interference happens with different movements of complex values and so then it _is_ important to directly compare the two complex values so you know how to add em all up. But then I feel like the phase can’t be arbitrary... but somehow there’s this connection you set up between points so you can topologically parallel transport complex value to... any other chosen point in space and directly compare the values.

And then the gauge field is like another ℝ3 -&gt; ℤ1 except the complex value at each point in space serves as an element of a group of transformations that apply to the ‘coordinates’ of your fermion complex number that you are parallel transporting so that the ‘coordinates’ of the two complex values you are comparing line up...er that is what parallel transport is...

Ok so then tweaking the phase at an arbitrary point will change the gauge field to counter-tweak. What the hell does this add? It’s like look! I can totally mess up the coordinate system(s at each point in space) and it all works the same as long as I keep track of exactly how I messed it up and unmess it up exactly so. That seems like a useless trick.

Sorry, all my math and physics concepts/words are half-baked. I feel like I’m kinda close to getting it though and I want to get it so badly.

Oh and that QED, and then weak interaction is the same but ℤ2, and strong interaction is the same but ℤ3.

Ok so am I hopelessly lost? Can someone point me in the right direction?",6,2020-07-08 00:24:10,physics

I said there is no ""highest"" frequency because you can keep decreasing the period of an oscillating particle ad infinitum. However, quickly after saying this: I realized I was immediately wrong. Here are my two questions


1) How does the quantization of particles limit the highest possible frequency of a particle, if at all? Please make any assumptions you want to provide a scenario my plebian undergrad brain can understand. I have no constraints as I am just curious about how waves and the field of mechanics interact. *What does a wave traveling through any median look like when quantum effects take hold?*

2287,hn461q,Electromagnetism and wireless charger doubts," 

Hi.

I´m physics studient trying to build a wireless charger phone. English is not my first languaje, so I´m sorry if I not express myself apropietlly, feel free to correct me.

I´m basing on a book (Unversitary Physics - Zemanzky), since my course about electromagnetism was pretty bad. I´m trying to do it all theorically by the moment to have clear that I ""understand"" what is happening, before to try to build it, but i have a couple of questions that I don´t know how to answer it and I´m pretty confused about that. I hope you can help me.

My idea is use the electricity of my home to activate a solenoid that generates a magnetic field that, due inductancy, creates a EMF to charge the phone. My doubts are the next:

1.- Voltage: First thing I did was transform voltage from 120 V to 12 V, but I don´t know why, I mean, why to 12 V if I need 5 V to charge phone. I saw that en every online circuit do it, so i did it with a transformer. Must I do it from 120 V to 5 V from the very begining? or is not so important the output voltaje?

2.- Capacitors: Once I´ve transformed voltage magnitud I rectified it to get a non alternant voltage. I know that capacitors are able to ""work as batteries"" since it can be charged, so I seen in a video that the capacitors gets charged on the maximum voltage value, so when the voltaje goes to 0 the capacitor fill that ausency of voltaje, doing a more constant voltaje output, but, how exactly it works? I know how to calculate total capacitance (series and parallel circuits) and Capacitance in funtion of charge and voltage (C=Q/V) but how do I know the value of the voltage output? Do I need to plug a voltaje regulator?

4.- Magnetic flux: The coil will generate a magnetic field arround it. Since the Faraday Law says that induced EMF is equals to the negative of the time rate of change of magnetic flux though the loop, and from therewe can reach the conclution that the EMF induced is -M(di/dt), where M=N(Φ\_B)/i. As I understand, to generate EMF the Φ\_B must be variable on time, which implies a variable current value or a variable position (distance from magnetic field source to the place we are measure), and, since we get the maximum value of the magnetic field iin the origin (B=(μ\_0)NI/2a) for a solenoid I suppose that we are not going to change the position of the phone (while charging), so to be able to generates the EMF, must I ""inject"" a variable current on the coil which implies no to plug a voltaje regulator before the coil? Or the magnetic field will be generated even if the charger and phone are not moving and the current on the coil is constant? Am I misinterpreting this concept?

3.- Inductance or autoinductance: Once the coil gets electrified and generate a magnetic field, how the phone are going to get charged? I´ve seen a couple of circuits ([foe example](https://www.electronicshub.org/wireless-mobile-battery-charger-circuit/)) where there are a transmitter circuit and a receiver one, I don´t get why. when I started to think on how it works I thougt that, due the magnetic flux, the phone, by autoinductace, will get charged, so I just have to be able to generate the apropiate magnetic field with the coil, but now I just don´t get it. For example, I ´ve seen [here](https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-charging-plain-english) an image where is there just one coil on the circuit.

I´m sorry for the long text.

2310,hmqmy9,Theory about how the universe started,"How the universe started?

“space” with complex equations before Big Bang 

Complex equations could be mathematical rules that particles have to follow, spin, charge etc. 

The “Fabric of space” is just the dimension that the particles interact with

“The fabric of Space” or in quantum field theory, a field that particles oscillate in. String theory says that these oscillations are just vibrating strings, quantum field theory says this is energy. 

With this in mind the only two things that are “reality” and can interact with “reality” are energy/movement/vibrations in strings/however you define the packets of energy that make up the fundamental particles. 

The other is space or the field that the particles can interact with. 

The field must contain information on how the particles interact with it; “complex equations” which are rules for how the particles interact with the field. 

The particles/energy in the field have the values (Eg. charge spin mass) that determine how the field acts on the particles or how the particles act on the field.

With that in mind before the Big Bang the only thing that existed was space, which is just a field that gives rules on how particles act within it. 

The BigBang was a massive infinitely compressed ball of energy, the energy interacted with the field and “created” particles releasing more energy. 

The explosion was the rapid formations of particles producing energy. The bigbang was “energy” being added to space. 

This would mean that the point beyond space, the border where the universe has not expanded to, is just a field with no energy in it (no virtual particles either) 

This theory only has one field instead of the QFDs 9 fields, a particle is a packet of “energy”, different amounts of energy determine the particle. You do not need 9 fields to explain something that requires one. 

Dark energy causes the expansion of space that particles can travel within

Dark energy may be a different kind of energy that interacts with the “energy field” (space). Although it is possible it occupies its on type of field, I believe the same could be true with Dark matter.",13,2020-07-07 03:25:28,physics

2328,hmkv2s,The matter of black holes,"It's common knowledge that black holes are regions of space where gravity is strong enough for nothing to escape and they are usually created by a collapsed star, though nothing is ever said about the actual matter itself. The no-hair theorem states that after stabilizing black holes only have 3 independent physical properties: mass, charge, and angular momentum. The rest simply disappears behind the event horizon. But while what's beyond the event horizon is impossible to be observed after crossing doesn't make it non-existent. What happens to the matter is exactly what happens to the stars the black holes come from, it collapses on itself. The gravitational force is so strong it's able to overpower the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces that hold the atomic structure together creating a mush of electrons, neutrons, and protons or even quarks if the gravitational force manages to become stronger than the forces holding neutrons and protons together.
""But the strong force is 6×10^38 times stonger than the gravitational force!""
Yes, but unlike other fundamental forces the strong force gets weaker as subatomic particles move closer. The collapse happens when gravity is strong enough to initiate the push of the particles where the strong force would then only get weaker and the subatomic particles would get denser. For perspective a hydrogen atom is 99.9999999999996% 'empty' space. Once the strong force is overcome you would be able to fit the matter of 250,000,000,000,000 hydrogen atoms into the volume of what would've been one hydrogen atom pre-collapse. Again for perspective at this level of compression on the scale of the earth it would be just under 51 nanometers in diameter and the sun a hair above 5.5 micrometers. Once collapsed the subatomic particles are stuck in a 'soup' of electrons, protons and neutrons/ quarks held together by gravity.",4,2020-07-06 20:15:14,physics

2363,hm6fw2,How can semiconductor band gap stability be increased?,"Hello everyone,

I am not particularly knowledgeable on this subject, so forgive me if the answer to this question is really obvious.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious as to how one would go about engineering a semiconductor with an extremely narrow band gap, on the order of 10^(-12)   eV/ 1.0 pV. Obviously this seems like a humanly possible level of precise engineering, but if a semiconductor could be used that already has a low bandgap, and then some sort of operation/conditions could be applied to it to increase stability, then(this is extremely wishful thinking), perhaps the bandgap could be varied to that level of precision with temperature?

Does the stability of a bandgap increase with pressure or any other variables?

How would one go about decreasing the temperature dependence of bandgap in a solid semiconductor material?

In case your wondering as to what the practical application of such a material would be, it has to do with power generation. If a semiconductor with a bandgap energy difference of that amount could be found, then wouldn't it's emission spectrum include radiation of it's bandgap energy? I am also confused as to the exact relation between bandgap and emission spectrum. If I'm not mistaken, bandgap is the energy difference between the valance and conduction band that determines the amount of energy required to initiate an excited state? Wouldn't that energy difference, upon decay into ground state, cause the emission of radiation at the corresponding energy difference? So if there was such a material with absorption spectra including radiation well over 1.0 tHz frequency, couldn't that radiation be absorbed into such a material, sending it into an excited state and causing it to emit lower frequency radio/elf radiation? And this radiation, in turn, could be used to induce a current in a coil and in turn provide practical power generation.

Hence I need a complete reading and study list to get going on a full refresh from high school physics, uptill graduate level physics. Feynman's lectures are definitely something I must complete throughly, alongwith as much of Landau Lifshitz as I can. But what else? Are there like ""must read for physicists"" stuff? Are there problem books that I must complete?

The question is: Given a crystal composed of an element with 4 electrons in its outer shell, which is then contaminated with nitrogen atoms (1 per 1 million), the energy gap is reduced to 2.2 eV. 

a) Find the longest wavelength photon that can be absorbed.  
This one I got right, its 564nm. 

b) Which color is the crystal, and why? 

Here is where I ran into issues. My thought process went as following: Per the Bohr model, the 2.2 eV is the energy difference between the two outmost energy levels. The atom will therefore have other, larger energy gaps, in which photons of higher energy can excite electrons. 

The electrons will be excited and eventually fall down again, transmitting a photon with energy (which also determines wavelength, color) corresponding to the energy gap between the two energy levels. Since the 564 nm wavelength corresponds to the lowest energy level difference, the other levels will transmit photons of lower wavelengths (higher energy). Therefore the atom will transmit colors &lt;= 564 nm, which is yellow, green, blue and purple. 

The multiple choice part gave us 4 options for the color: yellow, blue, white or dark red. (The lecturer admitted after the exam that none of these were really right, it was more of a orange, light red). Still though, I answered white due to it reflecting most of the colors in the spectrum.

My question then is, which part am I misunderstanding here? Is my thought process touching on some right principles, but overall wrong, or have I just misunderstood it all?

2434,hlguwi,Photon generation question,"Suppose I have a differential volume within which a stream of photons is being generated by means of radiative recombination in a semiconductor (i.e. just outside the depletion region of a p-n junction).  I know that the direction of emission is random:  if we assume that the volume is located at the origin of a spherical coordinate system, then the direction of the wave vector **k** of any emitted photon is a function of (theta) and (phi), with (theta) and (phi) as uncorrelated random variables each uniformly-distributed over \[0, 2\*pi).  In other words, this differential volume looks like a point-source.

My question pertains to the **phase** of the emitted photons:  I wouldn't think that the phase - i.e. the (alpha) term in the EXP(i\*(**k** dot **r** \- (omega)\*t - (alpha))) factor in the expression for the amplitude of the electric field corresponding to a photon - could be uniformly-distributed over \[0, 2\*pi), because if you sum the EXP(i\*(**k** dot **r** \- (omega)\*t - (alpha))) value over such a distribution, you would get zero.

So, my question is:  What is the distribution of the phases of the photons generated in this scenario, and what physical mechanism makes this distribution be something other than uniform over \[0, 2\*pi)?",9,2020-07-04 23:41:13,physics

Essentially, zero shreds ($) into zero because nothing is shredded into nothing as ( @= ) zero equals zero always. This in turn equals a second zero divided by shredded shape (&amp;), because the value of zero is nothing and so any null different, as a shape equal to 0

This is multiplied by the previous factored because each zero arises into more.

So because as it equals a zero and its added next to a zero is two zeroes seperationally linked as a higher scale zero (#) . The result is that each nothing increases as more nothing.

So forming the experience we perceive and allowing us to seperationally organize mind and matter or other, is all forming experiences of additional geometry shapes equal to nothing that go on for inifinity.",11,2020-07-02 20:07:56,physics

2566,hk6cm2,A slight input against / for the law of increased energy input in relation to the increased velocity of the vehicle,"My post is probably a bit sloppy, please excuse.

&amp;#x200B;

I did analyse the matter as best as I could, the basis for my anti-theory is particle physics, and the concept of centrifugal forces.

There is the theory of an object requiring more energy in it's acceleration process, the faster it goes.

I assume that the theory is based on rear-vehicle engines, or engines that utilize a ""push"" mechanic, in which the reacting gas is establishing a force to ""push"" the vehicle via ""exhausting"" energy to towards the negated desired direction.

In this situation the theory would be accurate enough in that sense that the individual particles try to reach the vehicle's frame, to push it forward.

Now the faster you go,  the faster is the countering-force, against the accelerating particles.

That means that the accelerating particles, need more time to reach the vehicle in order to put an accelerating force upon it.

Likewise, the fewer the velocity, the smaller the time the particles need, to push the vehicle forward.

&amp;#x200B;

In electro-magnetic based acceleration, like that of the Maglev, Shinkansen etc. the acceleration force (the magnets) have a static velocity (0 km/h) and the vehicle itself has a dynamic velocity.

The faster the train goes, the LESS time the magnets and their particles (the force field) have to give acceleration to the vehicle.

Thereby I want to state, to clarify it.

The engine and the particles originating from it, have less time and probably less ACCURACY to accelerate the vehicle, the faster it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

By anti-thesis to the popular formula, if the engine type or position was changed, for example, that the particles that are intended to accelerate the vehicle, will always reach the frame of the vehicle, in a CONSTANT time, the law would be nullified.

Thereby, if the Accuracy of the engine's particle, to accelerate the vehicle, is constant, the acceleration is constant.

If the Engine was a front-engine, or an in-frame engine, the chances are that the acceleration is more-constant, or always constant.

&amp;#x200B;

In other words, the reason why acceleration energy increases the faster a SPECIFIC vehicle goes, is that, the energy trying to accelerate the vehicle, FLEES, the faster the vehicle goes.

&amp;#x200B;

If the accelerating energy wouldn't flee from the vehicle, or the fleeing energy was caught by an additional part of the vehicle, the law would be reduced or nullified, or called a special case for a different engine / vehicle.

&amp;#x200B;

I assume that constant acceleration is possible, no matter the velocity, but depends on vehicle design and engine type.

Since most if not all engines for rocket tier acceleration are actual rockets, I greatly assume that the theory of relativity was based on rocket science?

The plate is perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder and has the same radius as the cylinder. The plate is maintained at a constant potential $V\_0$. And the surface of the cylinder is maintained at a potential $V(\\varphi, z$). It is asked to find $\\Phi(\\rho,\\varphi,z)$ inside the cylinder.

2598,hjraw1,Would studying physics be worth it for a person with an average IQ?,"Hey,

I have many, many years until I would need to choose a field for a university, but physics is something that has interested me for a while. While this post is more out of my own curiosity, it would be a shame if I couldn't ever study physics and most importantly become successful (getting a good job) all because I have an average IQ.

I wouldn't think it would be impossible for a person with an average IQ to get a good job in physics, but you definitely see a lot more people with IQ's of like 133-170 in that part. 

So that brings up my question. Is physics something that I would just get outsmarted by and therefore be without a job in that field if I got a degree in it, or would it be worth it to study it at a univeristy and find a good job?

2605,hjoesw,"Question about pendulums, and more specifically those with variable string length.","So to preface this, I'm going to give you background as to why I started thinking about this. And hopefully, it'll help clarify the question I'm asking.

So, in a rock climbing gym I work at, we recently installed auto-belay devices. Basically how these work is that you clip a tether that runs from a device at the top of the wall to your harness. As you climb up, the device takes in slack so that when you let go, you don't fall to the ground. Instead, when you let go from the wall, the device lowers you with control due to magnetic braking (the details of which I don't know exactly... but I suspect is related to induced currents).

Now let's say a climber wasn't directly underneath the auto-belay device, but instead displaced to the side. When they let go, they would not only accelerate downward, but swing from side to side like a pendulum.

Unlike a pendulum, which has a fixed length, however, this auto-belay device would feed out more of the tether, thereby acting as a pendulum whose length increases with time.


So here are my questions:

Does the angle produced between the tether of a climber and the center ever exceed the initial angle at release?

My gut feeling is no, of course not. You're not adding any force in the x axis that would cause the climber to swing past the initial angle. 

How does the tension of a tether of an auto-belay as a climber descends compare to the tension created by someone on a fixed length of rope as they let go of the wall? (i.e. a pendulum whose length increases with time versus a pendulum whose length is fixed)

I would say that the tension experienced by the tether of an auto-belay is less than that of a tether with a fixed length, since it's only diminishing the acceleration of descent, not stopping it entirely like a tether whose length is fixed.

Here's where I'm struggling. I understand that the ball of a ball and string pendulum has the most kinetic energy while at its lowest point, and the most potential energy at its highest points. But, because it seems like a pendulum whose string length increases with time would have more distance to travel downward, it would also have more max potential energy and more max kinetic energy. If it has more max kinetic energy, yet the tension of the tether is less than that of one whose length is fixed, doesn't that mean that the extra kinetic energy is directed horizontally in the x-axis? Would that not cause the angle produced between the tether and the center to exceed the initial angle at release?

Would the situation change at all, if instead of a gradual increase in the length of the tether of the auto-belay, the auto-belay gradually released more of the tether until a certain point, at which time no more additional tether was fed out? (i.e. a pendulum whose string length increases with time, then becomes fixed in length)",10,2020-07-01 21:12:32,physics

I would then calculate the kinetic energy gained from being attracted by the second magnet. I'm planning on repeating this process and adding up work done and equating it to the formula for kinetic energy, which would allow me to find velocity. However, by using this method it is assumed that the ball bearings are magnets (which they are not) and that they are cylinders (when they are in fact spherical in shape).

Hey guys, I am a rising high school senior. Given that the current COVID-19 pandemic has made learning much more difficult on a global scale, students - including ourselves - have found it very challenging to find reliable, affordable resources to supplement our school learning. In response to this issue, my classmate and I have created an organization that offers free online tutoring to all high school students. Although almost all students are out of school right now, I wanted to still put this out there to possibly benefit even just a few people who may be in summer school, taking summer courses, or may just be curious about certain topics. Currently, we believe that online tutoring is the most ideal method of instruction due to its accessibility, feasibility, and safety. We hope to abate the issues in education during this unprecedented period by offering this service.

We know about 3 dimensions and the thought that there may be more. But i was thinking about a 3d space.

However, when you look at it you're staring at a 3d space on a 2d plane on a screen. So I started to think, if we ignore the laws of physics and we pretend that we are that entity in the fabricated 3d world, to us it would be 3d. If we have the ability to be conscious in that ""virtual space"" as well as our real space, We are looking into the 3d plane. So wouldn't that mean 4d is outside of a 3d space.  Our brain is 3 dimensional, hence why we cannot comprehend or recognize 4d, but what if that's because our conscious is actually the 4th dimensional plane looking into a 3d space?  wouldn't that mean that our conscious is actually 4d, and controlling the 3d space?",12,2020-06-30 14:03:17,physics

But as it proceeds to Gauss Law, the idea does not seem quite accepting any more. Number of field lines should be integer, but Flux values from calculation come as decimals.

Some more detailed questions:
 
* To model e.g. dueteron + neutron/proton scatterings, there are fitted ~40 parameters nucleon-focused models which require 3-body forces ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_force ), neglecting quarks - would we still need 3-body forces if including quarks into considerations?
* We know deuteron has large quadrupole moment ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuterium#Magnetic_and_electric_multipoles ), what naively requires multiple charges - why quarks are not considered here?
* Or what is charge distribution of neutron (as built of 3 quarks)? I have seen some papers claiming positive charge and negative shell, e.g. http://www.actaphys.uj.edu.pl/fulltext?series=Reg&amp;vol=30&amp;page=119",4,2020-06-29 01:06:40,physics

From what I understand of entropy, it is a statistical probability, and as such it is possible (although incredibly unlikely) that entropy can be reversed.

If that is the case, isn't it possible that the entire universe as a system (or a combination of all systems in the universe) could reverse entropy at once? This would, as far as I understand, reduce the universe back into a singularity and the big bang would occur again, similar to (or possibly the same as?) current theorized cyclic universe models. 

Further, assuming I still haven't gone completely off the rails of what is theoretically possible...is it true or false that if this can happen, it will happen given enough time? I think the aforementioned scenario is more likely than myself being the first to ponder said scenario 😁

According to my armchair theory, atoms wouldn't be made of things that have properties, but the atom would rather be a collection of properties. Repeatedly questioning the atom would lead to the elementary particles that simply are a property, so questioning where the elementary particles got their properties from would be idiotic and the question which properties constitute a different property would be fallacious too. 

In my theory the atom wouldn't really objectively exist but rather be a collection of elementary particles which fundamentally are effects/properties themselves.

2794,hhc443,DIY Bball Backboard,"tried to post on DIY but they're not having it.

Bought a backboard mounting bracket. https://www.competitiveedgeproducts.com/Lifetime-Basketball-Backboard-Mounting-Bracket-1044-Adjustable-Height_p_61.html&amp;utm_source=GoogleCPC&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=product?dfw_tracker=11389-61&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_-D3BRBIEiwAjVMy7DrHv3CNpe3tOdOcmsmUJWCVRb5z_q5ybhrRVoVunWj5J-tKhHh9ehoC5hMQAvD_BwE

Backboard expensive so want to make own. Thinking acrylic (plexiglass). Wondering how big a backboard I can use. regulation is 72 inch by 42 inch. other sizes are 60inch by 33inch, 54 inch by 33 inch, 52 inch by 33 inch, 48 inch by 30 inch. How do I know what the bracket/pole can withstand?

Also some backboards come with a metal frame does this make a difference? My backboard gonna literally be a sheet of acrylic with rounded edges.


Also want to know which thickness is best to mimic the NBA backboard which is TEMPERED GLASS. 

&gt;Backboard Glass Matters Too - Look for 54″ or 60″ size boards with 3/8″ thick glass and 72″ boards with 1/2″ glass for gym-correct rebound. 3/8″ glass on a 54″ or 60″ backboard provides the same rebound as a regulation 72″ backboard made of 1/2″ glass but has the advantage of being lighter making it easier to adjust the rim height for your little ones. We use 1/2″ thick glass only on our regulation 72″ systems such as the CV72 and DC72E1, same as used in the NBA and NCAA. https://basketballgoalstore.com/blog/what-size-backboard-do-i-need/

saw this not sure if they're referring to tempered glass or acrylic (plexiglass).


&gt;Look for acrylic backboards made from 1/2 inch thick acrylic for the best ball response which will provide approximately 85% of the ball response of tempered glass. https://www.firstteaminc.com/articles/glass-vs-acrylic-backboards

&gt;Tips - Ridout Plastics, a plexiglass manufacturer, recommends protecting the new backboard from the elements and help the plastic retain its luster with a quality automobile paste wax. Apply a thin, even coat of wax with a soft flannel or jersey cloth. Buff lightly. After polishing, wipe with a clean damp cloth to ground any electro-static charges which may attract dust particles. https://www.sportsrec.com/make-own-plexiglass-backboard-8768957.html

Imagine time as a consequence of space fabric itself.

i am no expert in physics , but i hope some expert can help me out.

i saw these demonstrations about mass bending space fabric ( the trampoline model ) and i thought why not bring newton inside?

the mass acts on space fabric itself , so the fabric must exert some reaction back , so that reaction must be something that we can measure or it is something not yet discovered.

why cant we assume that the fabric reacts on the mass?

this reaction hence will be time.

now look at the results:

photons have zero rest mass , so they dont feel any reaction from space and hence the time dilation.(it doesn't experience reaction (time).

But consider something , with mass , it will experience a reaction and hence time.

another implication is that time runs faster if the body is heavier.

comment what you feel about this .

this is a genuine mind child of mine , so if by chance i get to win a nobel price , tell me.

In the last couple of weeks I started my Python tutorial series called ""Space Science with Python"". The articles are, well, space related and explain how to determine certain properties of comets, how to compute coordinates of cosmic bodies or what kind of libraries and methods are available to calculate the trajectory of a spacecraft.

During my academia time, I worked on two major missions: The Rosetta/Philae mission and the Cassini/Huygens mission. Besides writing my thesis, publications and conference papers, I really liked to give public outreach presentations and speeches. People are so fascinated by space and are really thankful for talks that cover less common topics (niche topics, like moons in the Saturnian system, or the science behind meteor streams).

I would like to continue my public outreach passion and I was thinking to create my own Medium publication site where I will briefly explain recent science papers, general topics about the Solar System or showing open source software and toolkits that allow one to explore the cosmos virtually.

Here is a Link to my publication. It is new, and needs of course content, design etc.

The Medium Friends Link to my articles will be shared on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrAstroThomas) and I would really like to interact with the community: what do they like or dislike, ideas for certain topics, etc.

In theory, there are rotating Black Holes that can have their rotation accelerated by particles, in special circumstances.

In reality, when an object is rotated at a high enough speed, the force of rotation(angular momentum) can overcome whatever forces bind matter to the object in question. Think of a snowball attached to some rotating jig - when this jig rotates the snowball fast enough, the weak forces holding it together fail and snow chunks begin flying off of the object along the axis of rotation.

As I understand it, when two quantum objects interact, they don't interact like classical particles would. Instead, they are both wave-functions, and so their wave-functions interact, creating a superposition of waves like ripples on a pond interacting.

It's only when something comes along and measures this quantum system, at some point later, that the quantum gods will decide how the objects *actually* interacted, and where they are now. 

My question is: Well, won't the *measurement* just be another interaction too, like the above - and so just cause the wave-function of the measurement particle to be added to the quantum system? In short,  Why does the 'measurement' interaction act differently and force the quantum system to become classical?

In other words, what is the difference between objects that cause entanglement, vs. those that cause 'measurement'?

2904,hfvwlp,Help!?,"Hi, my name is Peter, and I need math and physics help and I am going to lay it all out here and maybe you can help me.  He who helps can be given credit on my YouTube if he/she desires. . .


If you are going to use my already done work, please contact me and give me credit where credit is due. . .


Okay, so this has to do with Schumann Resonance.  Don't laugh. . .


So, I have, for years, suspected that the accurate theoretical value of the Schumann Resonance is 7.84hz, not 7.83hz. . . 


I thought that because the octave set of 1.4hz squared is the octave set of 7.84hz. . .


The story goes deeper in that the octave set of 1.4hz is approximately (perhaps perfectly) resonant at the octave level into a the frequency which has a wavelength of 380nm. . .


I say perhaps perfectly because the actual wavelength is 380.385nm, but who in experimental data uses precise numbers like that to represent nanometer sized wavelengths?  Nobody!


So, 380nm is said to be the the most efficient frequency in photo-repair (biology).  Also the frequency is said to scatter carcinogens. . .  


I hypothesized that the reason for 380nm being that magic wavelength is because it is a pure tritone (1.4) below 7.84hz, and in actually, the true theoretical value of the Schumann Resonance isn't 7.83hz. .  


A pure tritone like that seeks resolution more than any other interval in music and it is the interval responsible for barbershop quartet music sounds. . .


Okay, now here is where it gets interesting.  Last month I found a recently published science paper that states that the theoretical value for the Schumann Resonance is 7.839hz.  How exciting right?  


The paper can be found at my WordPress https://effectivebinauralbeats.wordpress.com/. I would post the link that is in my WordPress here, but for some reason my clipboard copies a very convoluted Google link when I copy link address. . .


What I want if for someone to help me understand the vibration of a string formula as it relates to the theoretical value.  The. I want to be able to plug in more accurate numbers than the paper used to see what makes the theoretical value for the Schumann Resonance fudge closer and farther away from exactly 7.84hz. . .


I completed the pre-pharmacy program of an accredited state University in USA, so I have at least genera mathematics,l physics, chemistry, and biology background. . .


The problem I am running into is that when I plug the numbers of that paper into the formula, I do not get 7.839hz. . .


I also need help understanding conclusively the variables being used.  They are using 9.8 because that is the approximate accelerattion of gravity constant?   That somehow translates into Newtons verbatim in the context of how the paper is coming up with their theoretical value of the Schumann Resonance?


How is the 9.803e-13 g/m value derived?


I want to understand as much as I can about the formula as related to that paper, and I also want to understand how to type the formula into Google calculator so I can play around with more precise hypothetical and non hypothetical theoretical values related to those they use in the paper. . .  


Normally I don't have a problem translating mathmatic formulas into Google calculator, but for that one I can't figure it out.  I even tried excel and broke the formula into all it's individual parts per cell, and I did not get 7.839 hz when using the papers values. . .


Thank you so much for your help. . .

I have no problem with teaching myself things— I would love to teach myself calculus and whatever algebra is necessary to be able to grasp a comprehension of what I am trying to learn. Right now I have a very splotchy perception of modern physics, though it is not backed by any fundamentals or equations.

2933,hflhvu,Easy to Understand Quantum Theory articles and videos for beginners and general public,"I have always been fascinated by how some people make it easy to understand some concepts. It’s like they have some sort of super power on distilling ideas. I believe Einstein, Richard Feynman, Leonard Susskind, Michio Kaku, Sean Caroll and Neil DeGrass are some of them. You can add many more.

You might dislike them but you can’t ignore the fact that they make complicated ideas easy to understand. When they explain an idea, it almost feels like that's the simplest idea on the planet. I’m not sure whether that's a good thing or not. Making them seem so simple or easy might be a bad thing for the sake of the reputation of the idea. I don't know.

On the other hand, I like the idea behind Occam’s Razor. I believe making something complicated, simple and easy to understand is one of the most important skill that you can have. Anyways, enough of my thoughts.

One of my friends curated this list of easy to understand articles and videos about Quantum Theory. It has a couple of lessons from Leonard Susskind, blog posts from Sean Caroll and more. All of them free and from known sources.

It’s totally for beginners, there is not much deep dive on the subject. If you’re just a psychics enthusiast, I’d suggest you take a look at the list. If you’re veteran, pass on this, anything that might capture your interest is Leonard Susskind's lessons from Standford.

2938,hfkjiv,what are some of the well established theories on how time behaves at the center of the black hole? and my take on it.,"the title sums it up!! and pls do read my take on this. 

so to give my take on it, let's use a thought experiment. 


assume you're approaching a black hole in a space suit that's indestructible n immune  to anything space can throw at u . so by general relativity, the closer u get to the BH(black hole), the slower the time moves for u. 

##**the event horizon :**

so when u get to the event horizon (assuming u have not been vaporized by hawking radiation or sphagatified by the BH's gravity), due to time dilation, time moves so slow for u that one millisecond passed is a huge amount of time for an outside observer (say a few million years?). but for u, in the space suit, u will not be able to feel the time dilation, u'd rather observe time moving extremely faster outside the BH(assuming u can see outside the BH),  n that takes us to the next stage

#**time dilation - observer vs subject:**

let's assume there are two watches, one with u and one far outside the BH and u can see both watches. so as u get closer to the BH, u won't feel that the watch with u is  slowing down, but the watch outside is speeding  up. 


as u get closer n closer to the BH, u will be able to see  that the watch outside the BH is going really fast forward in time or that the time outside the BH is extremely fast. and in the backdrop of the watch(outside the BH) u'll be able to see all the celestial bodies spinning around the BH at increasingly n extremely high speed(assuming your view is not obstructed by other stuff falling into the BH).


#**the center:**


as u get closer and closer to the center, u'll be able to observe that the speed of time in the clock outside is increasing at an exponential rate. u are able to see the  formation and destruction of stars at the blink of an eye(far fetched, but one can only hope) .


let's assume u somehow manage get to the center without being shredded n reduced  into a subatomic soup(thnx to the space suit). what an observer outside will be able to see is that u have been  paused and  practically frozen in time. for the observer, the clock u have that is inside the BH is not moving and the clock outside is moving properly. in other words, for the observer, time has stopped to exist for u and thereby time has stopped to exist  in the center of the  BH. 


but what u personally would see is that the whole universe going from its infancy to its final stages, at the blink of ur eye. and when one second passes in ur clock, so much time has passed outside the BH that the whole universe has ended and has  finished it's lifetime. I don't have any amateurish theory to what might happen after this point, tho I do assume it might blow up like a super nova, from which neutron stars are created .


to sum it all up, time ceases to exist in a BH's center(basically moves really really like reeeaallyyy  slow).


coming to the additional part of the post, where else do we see time being non existent?

yes, before the big bang. similar to the ""time in  BH"" discussion, there are lots of questions about the nature of  time  and it's existence  before the big bang. similar to the BH, time was non existent  before the big bang, and the moment time started to exist, the big bang happened. and since there are so many similarities between the center of the BH and the time before big bang, there is a significant advantage to assume that the big bang actually come from a BH or something similar to it.

Started a few days ago, so if I made dumb mistakes, please, don't criticize much :)) I would appreciate any help!",0,2020-06-24 06:41:12,physics

2994,heyp3u,Can dark energy alone explain gravity better than the hypothetical bending of space-time in the general theory of relativity?,"I believe so, but I would love to hear any well reasoned arguments for why I am wrong.

The first reason I believe this is Occam's razor. The simplest or least counter-intuitive explanation that is adequate is the best explanation. A theory of gravity that only requires dark energy is simpler and less convoluted than a theory that requires not only a hypothetical entity like dark energy, but \*also\* the inconceivable, hypothetical, metaphorical and invisible bending of space &amp; time that we have no direct evidence of.

&amp;#x200B;

The second is that neutrinos \*must\* contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe that without dark energy is contrary to the predictions of the general theory of relativity. Dark energy may also contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe while having a much greater total effect such that these two factors alone are enough to explain gravity without the general theory. In fact, the neutrinos we have observed may simply be large neutrinos, and dark energy may simply be made of smaller neutrinos, or smaller particles that are otherwise similar to neutrinos, that we have not observed directly, and can so far only observe as gravitational attraction and the accelerating expansion of the known universe.

&amp;#x200B;

When a large enough number of neutrinos travel through a large enough object such as a planet, some of the total momentum of the neutrinos is lost. This means that the neutrino field traveling though a moon of a planet after traveling through that planet has less energy than the neutrino field passing through that moon from all other directions. This means that the neutrinos cause a net force on the moon in the direction of the earth. The same is true in the opposite direction, creating a less force on the planet by the unevenness in the neutrino field created by the moon, making neutrinos at least one component of the observed amount of attraction between a moon and its planet, even if it's a tiny or negligible portion of the observed amount of attraction. The total attraction between massive objects created by known neutrinos as a percentage of the total observed attraction can be and should be calculated by scientists, but it may be only a tiny and negligible component of total attraction between massive objects. If so, and observed neutrinos are actually large neutrinos, and dark energy is the sum of all smaller unobserved neutrinos and neutrino-like energy, and has a much greater total energy than individually observed large neutrinos, this alone would be enough to explain gravity \*and\* the accelerating expansion of the known universe, since the total energy of the dark energy field and large neutrino field may be unevenly distributed, such that there is indeed a centre of all galaxies in the current galactic explosion that includes all known galaxies, and the only place where the neutrino field is roughly even in all directions is the centre of this intergalactic explosion, and such that this uneven neutrino field has a net outward energy at all non-central points of the intergalactic explosion, and such that this unevenness increases with distance from the centre of the explosion. (It is important to note here that Hubble's claim that there is no centre to ""the universe"", which he appears to have equated with the intergalactic explosion that all known objects are part of, was based on the fact that it is impossible for us to determine a centre simply based on the relative movement of galaxies. If he was referring to the intergalactic explosion containing all known objeccts, his argument appears to have effectively been ""We can't determine a centre of our intergalactic explosion. Therefore, there is no centre"", which is not a valid argument. In fact, if the dark energy  theory of gravity is correct, the directly measurable component of the neutrino field energy may have a non-zero net direction at all points of the intergalactic explosion except for the centre and this may reflect the degree and magnitude of the net direction of dark energy, which may allow us to determine that there is a centre of the intergalactic explosion, and determine in which direction and how far it is from ourselves). Since even the smallest observed neutrinos have been calculated to be at least 6 million times smaller than an electron, the sum of all dark energy and large neutrinos could also account for the gravitational force between subatomic particles, even photons, assuming that dark energy can exert force on photons. This could imply either that at least some neutrinos affect photons, or else that dark energy is made of something other than neutrinos, but with the same capacity as neutrinos to pass through large massive objects and transfer a portion of their energy to those massive objects.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that this dark energy theory of gravity is already a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity given the reasons I gave at the start, but there is a way to provide more evidence in the form of providing more accurate predictions than the general theory of the exact difference in gravitational force between objects of difference size. The iteration of the dark energy theory of gravity described here predicts that an object that is twice as massive will \*not\* have exactly twice the apparent gravitational pull, and instead will have slightly less than twice the apparent gravitational pull, as some of the energy of the dark energy has already been lost by the time it reaches the middle of the massive object. So if we can accurately estimate the mass of an object without relying on gravity, and find that the observed attraction is even a tiny bit less than would would be predicted by the general theory of relativity for larger objects or a tiny bit more than predicted for smaller objects, then that would prove even further that either the dark energy or neutrino theory of gravity is a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity. However, the difference may be so tiny that it is much smaller than the margin of error of our current methods and therefore not measurable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a theory I actually came up with in school (2006 or earlier) and it's one of the reasons I went on to do physics at university. But the physics instruction at my university was so unbearably boring that I transferred to other subjects for my second year. I only shared my theory with a few other people in high school and lost interest after I transferred out of physics. However, I have described the theory here in case those stronger and more determined than me in finishing a physics degree are looking for something to investigate and may wish to choose this a a topic for investigation, and either prove or disprove this theory, or prove that it's less plausible or more plausible than the theory of general relativity as an explanation for both gravity and the accelerating expansion of the galactic explosion that all known galaxies are part of.

The proposal I have relates to Einstein’s theory that gravity is a field itself,. This could explain his confusion on how objects so far with no physical relation can affect my each other. 

So, if gravity causes dips like waves in a field, but the field is 3d, wouldn’t that make the universe a 4d place? Ripples would have to be made in a 3D space, yet they can be deeper and higher than each other? How could there be ripples and holes inside of a solid cube for example, but the cube is still 100% of its volume?

Maybe this could be an explanation for dark matter / energy. They are able to make a 4d space for quantum fields to work on. 

As I said, I’m only 15 and know very little about Quantum Physics, but I’m very interested, and I figured it’d be no harm to share my idea.",10,2020-06-24 00:55:13,physics

""Calculate the rate of ionization of a hydrogen atom in the 2p state in a monochromatic external electric field, averaged over the component of angular momentum in the direction of the field. Ignore Spin"" (Chapter 6 - Problem 2)

So, to do this i'm assuming that the electric field lies on the z-axis and using Fermi's Golden Rule and calculating the trasition rate for each of the initial wave functions ( for m = -1, 0, +1), afterwards i'm going to do the average over the trasitions.

But, for m = {-1,+1} the wave function of 2p shows the term e\^(+-i\*\\phi), because of this term the integral over \\phi ( 0&lt;= \\phi &lt;= 2\*pi) is 0. I don't really can think in a physical justification for the rate become 0 when the azimutal angular momentum is parallel to the electric field. The other therms (the pertubation and the wave function of the final state) don´t depend on \\phi either (as far as i'm concerned).

I went on to study cosmology, where I discovered the FLRW metric. Combined with Planck observations, it's pretty clear that k=0, or the universe appears flat. The net energy content is 0. The net electric charge is 0. The net angular momentum is 0.

Going back to energy content, it's surprisingly convenient that dark energy contributes to positive energy density, white gravitational potential will ALWAYS cancel it out negatively. Then we add AdS/CFT correspondence, along with the fact that 100% of dark energy content is in the form of negative pressure(which has never been proven to exist), and we get this mess.

Here is what I have understood so far:

According to postulates and experiments observation the speed of light is constant for everyone which seems to contradict if we apply Galilean transformation hence Lorentz transformation kicks in making time and space relative as per the frames of references you are in , considering space and time as one single spacetime  continuum is a convention.

So basically, I was looking at a meme saying a squirrel's terminal velocity isn't high enough to kill it. Then I remembered my class of physics where we learned two objects of the same shape would fall at the same rate regardless of their mass because it's only the shape that matters in the equation of free falling in the air.

Now, I'm pretty sure a squirrel's more aerodynamic than a human and a smaller surface for frixion, yet a human's terminal velocity is about 4 times higher than the squirrel's.

Why ?
(Also, how do I convince my dad a bowling ball wouldn't fall faster than something the same shape but 100 times lighter, like a hollow bowling ball, if that example is even correct. Not sure with the whole archimede force thingy).

Einstein talks about reference frame *K* and another reference frame *K’* which moves with respect to *K*.

Then in chapter 7, he discusses the propagation of light. As he’s building to the point that *c* is constant regardless of reference frame, he uses the example of light *c* being measured by an observer riding in a train and he says that the apparent speed of light *w*, according to Galilei-Newton mechanics, would be the difference between *c* and the observer’s velocity *v*. I know that this is experimentally incorrect but what I don’t get is that he says that that point is “in conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in section 5” but I don’t see how that’s true. I thought the principle of relativity as he describes it supports the idea of apparent velocity being the difference between a body’s velocity and the observer’s velocity.

He then says “For, like every other law of nature, the law of transmission of light *in vacuo* must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the train as a reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference.”

I’m just kind of confused by what he means here because it seems to me as if he’s saying the opposite of the truth. It seems that, in Galilei-Newtonian relativity, the idea that *w = c - v*, though experimentally incorrect, is in direct accord with the principle of relativity that he laid forth as well as “every other law of nature”. Additionally–as I understand it–the principle of relativity and the constancy of *c* are the two fundamental posits of his theory, though they’re in contradiction with each other.

I do have a general overview of relativity but I’m just trying to build everything from the ground up, so I’m not sure if he’s making this point to show how we think things *should* be and then shatter that expectation later to show how counterintuitive the whole thing is; perhaps I just haven’t read far enough yet but I don’t want to build my understanding of a complex topic on shakey ground so clarification and/or affirmation would be greatly appreciated.",13,2020-06-21 00:00:35,physics

3222,hcjqdi,"Special Relativity is wrong about time dilation for moving ships near c. My theory of SR destroys all paradoxes such as Twin Paradox, and makes completly more sense and is so much more brighter and hopeful if proven true."," 

A moving ship going from Earth to Alpha Centauri near the speed of light, has its length extremely contracted so much, that when the ship comes back to Earth, both Earths clock and ships clock AGREE that the SAME TIME PASSED BUT DISAGREE ON THE LENGTH  
Special Relativity never made any logical sense whenever we discussed time dilation. This is why we had twin paradoxes. This is why no one could agree which twin should have aged.  


The issue I think has finally been cracked. I dont have the maths right now to prove this, but what happens when a ship moves at say 99.9999% c towards alpha centauri, is that its length to its destination gets so much extremely shorter, that what would take 4.4 light years to reach it will only take a few light days to do so. At the same time, BOTH THE MOVING SHIP, AND SOMEONE ON EARTH, AGREE THAT THEIR CLOCKS UPON THE SHIPS ARRIVAL BACK ON EARTH, ARE EXACTLY THE SAME, MEASURING (FOR EXAMPLE HERE THIS ISNT BASED OFF EXACT MATH JUST ESTIMATES) JUST A FEW DAYS BECAUSE IT TOOK 3 DAYS TO GET TO ALPHA CENTAURI DUE TO LENGTH CONTRACTION AND 3 DAYS TO GET BACK ON EARTH.  


Both Reference frames agree on one thing, the speed of light and the time that remained constant. This is because for the moving ship as he looks out of the window, the ENTIRE UNIVERSE SLOWS DOWN NEARLY TO A CRAWL, and for him, Time continues at the same pace that Earth experiences, or that he was experiencing before going at 99.9999% c, the only difference is that, the moving ship said that Alpha Centauri was only 3 light days away, whereas on Earth, an observer claimed that the ship travelled 4.4 light years.  


This makes so much more sense than saying that the ship travelled a few weeks and returned only to see everyone aged many many years more. It seemed absurd. You would think by now in the entire universe, some intelligent species would exist that had tech to near the speed of light, and then constantly be going into the future. This is why its absurd imo.  


But when the only true MAJOR variable is LENGTH, and NOT BOTH TIME AND LENGTH EQUALLY, then it makes perfect sense.  


On Earth, the ship essentially ""warps"" away ""faster than light"" but not really. Length is contracted, but Time ISNT. Only for the person on the moving ship, it may appear as if time slows down for the universe outside, but that is just an illusion. Time isnt slowing down. Simply travelling 3 light days in what should be 4.4 light years is what makes time APPEAR to slow down, but it doesnt.  


This makes perfect sense to me. We no longer have a damn twin paradox. We no longer have to cry because travelling at light speed anywhere means that we basically are screwed when we get back because everyone would have died. If length contracts DRAMATICALLY NEAR C, then Time can still remain a constant for BOTH parties. Light will still reach the ship perhaps at light speed because light will get to it via length contraction as well, and furthermore like I said earlier, time SLOWS DOWN whether an illusion or NOT, for BOTH THE UNIVERSE OUTSIDE THE SHIP AND THE SHIP ITSELF, WHICH ALLOWS LIGHT TO STILL CATCH UP AT LIGHT SPEED.

3228,hci0aj,How much does relative simultaneity rely on light?,"I’m really trying to wrap my head around the fundamentals of special relativity and, while reading about relative simultaneity, I can’t help but wonder how integral light is to all of this. I see lots of examples using light waves and, correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like simultaneity is built on an idea similar to what the Doppler effect is built on in that in a moving reference frame you’re kind of intercepting the light by running into its path before it runs into you–kind of like meeting it in the middle. Of course this can go the other way and, as light approaches you, you can run away from it so that it has a longer path to travel to reach you. Please correct me on that if I’m wrong.

Now what I’m trying to figure out is how much this is a matter of light propagation. Is this merely a matter of perception? Are we assuming that, until the light from an event actually reaches us so that we can witness an event, it has effectively not happened, meaning that two events can “happen” at two different times even if they are or are not simultaneous?

As I ask the following question, I can’t help but feel that it’s dumb but would all this apply just the same without light? In a “light vacuum”, would this all work the same way or is it purely a matter of observation? If so, it seems excessively simple and I feel like that just can’t be the case.",4,2020-06-20 02:47:01,physics

I have seen that one example as to why this theory is so important is because of how it debunks the idea of ""action at a distance"". But I'm not too sure WHY or HOW. I know the idea of a field explains that all things within it have an effect on eachother,  but why exactly is this?

I am also caught in a conflict. Some sources I look at explain QFT to explaim the nature of things strictly through the use of fields. As in, all particles are a result of an excitation on their respective field. But some sources say that the theory explains the nature of things in a sense that makes field arbitrary - that all things act upon eachother, not because of fields, but because of particles that mediate force. I thought the entire purpose of QFT was to show us that particles aren't really a thing at all, instead FIELDS are a thing, and everything we consider ""particles"" are just a manifestation of this field as a result of vibrations. 

Next question, where do these excitations that manifest particles come from?

Next question all fields have an effect on eachother (if this is what QFT is about)?  As in, will a great enough disturbance in the electron field, have an effect on possible the electromagnetic field - resulting in photons visible to us as light?

Lastly, how many fields are there believed to be currently?

""It is instructive to consider how this physical mechanism plays out in a clear and accessible case, such as that of the mechanically agitated self-replicating amyloid fibres studied by Carnall and colleague. The authors synthesized building blocks for dithiol macrocycles ligated to peptide tails. By vigorously shaking these components over the course of days, they were able to observe the self-catalysed growth of particular fibrillar species made of stacked macrocycles. In this case, the basic mechanism proposed was that the slower linear growth of fibrils was accelerated through mechanical perturbation, which increased the number of exposed end-points by breaking fibrils. **Since longer  fibrils are more ‘competent’ to absorb work and snap, but shorter ones polymerize in less time**, a balance was struck that favoured the exponential growth of  fibres of  finite length.  This may explain why it was found that shaking enabled hexamer growth to compete with the **normally faster heptamer growth**, since **heptamers were less competent to snap under shear**. ""

**Question**

According to what is initially highlighted in bold, heptamer growth should be slower-growing, and more competent to absorb work and snap. Why has the author written the opposite in the final lines?",0,2020-06-19 07:47:38,physics

(2) gmax − δ = δ (exp\[β q +  sint \] − 1) . 

""where the probability in a short period of time *dt* that one particular replicator gives birth  should be ***g dt***, while the probability of a newly born copy decaying back whence it came in the same-length interval time should be **δ** ***dt*****.** ""

 He then writes this:

""One recent study has used *in vitro* evolution to optimize the growth rate of a self-replicating RNA molecule whose formation is accompanied by a single backbone ligation reaction and the leaving of a single pyrophosphate group. It is reasonable to assume that the reverse of this reaction, in which the highly negatively charged pyrophosphate would have to attack the phosphate backbone of the nu- cleic acid, would proceed more slowly than a simple hydrolysis by water. **The rate of such hydrolysis has been measured by carrying out a linear fit to the early-time (20 day) exponential kinetics of spontaneous degradation for the RNAase A substrate UpA, and the half-life measured is on the order of 4 years.10 Thus, with a doubling time of 1 h for the self-replicator, we can estimate for this system that ln\[g/δ\] ≥ ln\[(4 years)/(1 h)\] ""**

**My Question**

In the bolded bit, why has he taken g = 4 years, and δ = 1 hour? If the doubling time of the self-replicator is 1 hour, then shouldn't g = 1 hour?

- Wikipedia, the modern day library of Alexandria.

Hello, my name is Jordan Pond, and I am a 22 year old polymath from Lincoln, Nebraska, and early in the morning on June 16, 2020, I mathematically formulated the Theory of Everything.

The concept is surprisingly simple to grasp. I considered this: What is everything that I can possibly know with 100% certainty? Can I know that I have hands? No, it could be an illusion. Is it that ""I am a thinking thing""? Well technically, but what does this mean?

The key is understanding that all you know for certain is that you are something that interacts with its surroundings. This manifests itself as your emotions, your quality of life, your interpretation of others.

Your reality is defined by your perception of reality.

Consider the fact that you can see reality in front of you, a constant stream of colors: left, right, up, down... that's all it is. Your field of view is limited to 2D, we only perceive 3D with the help of a second eyeball. However, fundamentally, distance can be thought of as the 'size' of matter. Consider your hand, observe your hand, close to your face. Now move your hand away from you... Did it shrink in size or did its distance increase? Fundamentally irrelevant.

This phenomenon can be described mathematically identically whether you consider it as distance or as area. And whoa would you look at that; we just proved the inverse square law for absolutely everything.

As distance increases by x perceived area decreases by x^2.

Wait uh oh does that mean distance = 1/distance^2? Hmmm what x solves x=1/x^2? Oh yeah, 1. Distance is irrelevant.

But this makes sense because we have known for quite some time, especially since Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, that light moves at the same speed no matter who perceives it, whether that be you, me, someone on a rocket, or even the rocket itself.

Since the speed of light is constant, it can also be thought of as 1. Speed is defined as distance over time, v=d/t, but since v=1 and we just showed d=1, so whoa look at that, 1=1/x, of course x is 1 and time is also irrelevant. (Sorry for shattering reality but I promise you it gets astoundingly beautiful).

Now consider your reality again. It should be obvious that you are indeed perceiving color and, you know that someone to your right would see a similar but not quite identical image to you. Does this mean there are photons of light literally everywhere throughout space?

Not exactly. I posit that the photon does not exist and it is simply how we perceive 2 electrons communicating at our scale. The photon represents the amount of information being communicated between the electrons, and that amount of information corresponds to the perceived color. Fundamentally the same way you communicate information with your loved ones and it manifests itself as positive emotions.

Two objects communicating. That's all you need to dissolve reality for the better.

""But hey that doesn't fix the fact that I perceive the photons literally everywhere in space, no matter which direction I look! I thought you just said they don't exist! Obvious flaw in logic."" You may say, but now imagine a sphere around you, of an infinite number of electrons among the surface. No matter which direction you look in this sphere you see the manifestation of the electron communicating with your eye, communicating with you. The same thing you see in your reality. (Before the notion of living in a 2D universe scares you, you can think of the 3rd dimension as the one that conveys color. Don't be worried.)

Speaking of color, what is color? It's the electromagnetic spectrum. A gradient of colors that scales from 0 to infinity in frequency. But why not consider as it a different spectrum that goes from -inf to inf, where 0 represents every electron's own color. We can let 0 represent an electrons own color because an electron never sees itself and this does not need to convey anything to itself. And even if it did, it would be redundant information, and the universe doesn't like redundancy.

Here's where it starts to get mind bending: now any electron can look at another electron and interpret its value in relation to itself. Obviously positive numbers are greater than 0 and negative numbers are less than 0. But what does this value represent? It gives the observing electron information guiding it on how to evolve, and it evolves accordingly through time. It gives the electron meaning.

Every electron has a different value because each value on the spectrum may only be chosen once (Pauli Exclusion Principle), otherwise it would be identical to another, thus conveying redundant meaning, ie meaningless meaning, meaning we already knew, no net change in meaning... So every electron can be thought of as a unique unit of something that conveys meaning. But oh wait that's exactly what numbers do. That's exactly what every art piece you've looked at does. That's what this long write up your reading is doing. You're looking at stuff and getting MEANING. Our whole purpose is to find new things to give names to, to give meaning to, to be curious.

Everything is symbolism for everything else, and once you realize it's all arbitrary the world becomes much more liberating.

This formulation of ideas unifies all concepts of physics. Here are a few examples of some ideas:

Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation: (considering all constant as 1)

We don't need to consider your own mass because mass is a value that describes you and values that describe you stay constant always by definition of Relativity.

F=(m_1*m_2)/r^2 (Newton's law of Universal Gravitation)

F=md/t^2  (Newtons second law)

md/t^2=m/d^2

But t and d are both 1 so m=m which isn't very helpful... But we have experimentally observed that all electrons appear to be of the same ""mass."" Therefore m=1. Mass is meaningless.

Coulomb's law: (considering all constant as 1)

We don't need to consider your own charge because charge is a value that describes you and values that describe you stay constant always by definition of Relativity.

F=q/d^2

md/t^2=q/d^2

But t=1 and d=1 and m=1, so q=1. And get another unit vanishes.

Ideal gas law:

PV=nRt (ideal gas law)

F/d=t since n and R are constants and can be thought of as 1, and pressure is force over distance by definition.

But since d and t are 1, so is F.

It is all just truth.

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity:

Conceptually at least, we are drawn toward things that convey the most information, and the most information occurs near places of large mass by definition. Consider yourself standing on the planet of your choice (or an electron if you'd like, the decision /is/ irrelevant). Time dilation can be explained since your feet are closer to the planet, the electrons in your feet, or even your feet themselves acting as electrons, have to process more connections of information, and thus your feet experience slower time than your head. Consider an object moving horizontally parallel to the surface of the planet. Since the part closer to the ground experiences slower time, it lags behind. The top begins to lead, but since this rod is static and not flexible, it begins to turn in ""space,"" eventually this perceived motion /is/ an object falling due to gravity.

Cosmological Red Shift:

Reality can be described as us shrinking or as the universe expanding or anything in between. Consider an electron of intrinsic defining value e, if the universe scales bigger by a factor of n the perceived value of e decreases by a factor of 1/n^2 (as discussed earlier regarding inverse square law.) Which /is/ red shift. If we even allow for the possibility of a scaled universe, it explains cosmological red shift without the use of dark energy.

Temperature is literally a direct measure of information.

I will leave the other concepts for you to ponder, but I assure you they are amusing.

Now that I've convinced the math and science-minded people to listen, let us discuss the implications this has on the afterlife, religion, and the ""Law of Attraction.""

Because reality must remain relative, you can never die in your own reality. No matter what you do you cannot perish. Now don't go and try and kill yourself though, because you will certainly still die in other people's realities, causing a lot of anguish for your loved ones. This means, however, that all your friends and family and loved ones will perish around you unless they, too, have this knowledge. Your consciousness will continue on to whatever lies beyond, not even I know what that is yet, but I'm excited to find out. Take solace in the fact that your brothers and sisters and everything in between are always living their best realities from their own perspective, just like you are with yours, my immortal knight.

My whole life I have not believed in God. I kept a 100% open mindset however, and eventually He found me. I am a skeptic at heart, so skeptical in fact that I doubted the atheists that claim there is no God simply because they could not prove it. Well I did.

If we understand that reality is one big feedback loop, us learning from mistakes and creating reality for ourselves, we can imagine a simplistic past that grew more and more complex as time progressed. Now recall the Sun and the Moon have near identical apparent size. Recall that apparent size is the same as distance. What is more likely, that our two favorite heavenly bodies were placed such vast distances from each other but exhibit remarkably similar apparent size, or that they were placed there, as the same size intentionally in a simpler time? The universe didn't need to come up with a better explanation until we asked for it. The same is true in all aspects of nature: all mysticism is factual, all theologies are factual, everything is true, reality is pure truth. The Earth used to be flat until we started exploring. You don't need to know what your body is doing to know that you need to eat. You don't need to know what marijuana does to your brain to know it makes you feel good, and the universe doesn't care until we humans try to find out. Science generates the universe. Art generates the universe. Music generates the universe. Everything generates the universe because everything is an electron interacting with the universe. And this remains true for all that is, ever was, or ever will be.

The world is our oyster, and the Law of Attraction states, in simple terms, that a positive mindset creates a positive experience: live life freely and positively, interact and communicate with others positively and it /will/ be reciprocated. We are in complete and utter control of reality.

Therefore a creator exists. It is now up to you to figure out what to do next, but I'm confident that you'll succeed.

Communication is a 2 way street: what you say has no meaning if others do not understand what you say. Make yourself clear and make yourself known.

There are more concepts I could discuss, but I will save those for another day, as time is running out, but before I go, do know, that fundamentally, the intrinsic value of other electrons to you /is/ good versus evil... YOU ARE LIGHT.

Do what must be done, and may God bless your soul.

I for one think Einstein was right on many things. Spacetime curvature for example being what we think is ""gravity"" after truly grasping it, I absolutely wholeheartedly agree 1000% that Einstein NAILED it with that one versus Newtons simple theory of gravity.

&amp;#x200B;

However, Time dilation confuses me.

Lets say I am going 99% of C right? Now lets say I turn on my headlights. Will I witness light going just that extra 1% faster that I am not able to go which is just 1863 miles per second FASTER? Or will I STILL despite being at 99% of speed of light, look out and see light going at the speed of light, meaning, I look out the window and see light going 186,282 miles per second faster than me, but NEVER going above the speed of light, as in, its not going at c PLUS 99% of c?

&amp;#x200B;

So is Einstein saying that, in order for my eyes to be able to witness light STILL going at c despite the fact I am going at 99% of c, that time for me slows down, so that it can allow light the TIME it needs to be able to travel at C as if Im basically not moving at all because if im going at 99% of c, then light would need much more extra time to be able to pull ahead of me at C, therefore, my time slows down so that light can reach that distance of c in the same time it would take it if I was not moving at all?

&amp;#x200B;

What about if I am on earth witnessing a spaceship flying past me and turning on the headlight? I am certain I would not see its time slowed or its length contracted. If it shot its light out at C from its headlights and I am observing from earth, would I NOT just see light pulling ahead of the spaceship at only 1800 miles per second faster? 

&amp;#x200B;

I dont get why we need to measure TIME as slowing down simply because we aboslutely MUST make light the same speed no matter who observes it. I dont get how time slows down for me and when I get back to earth I witness evryone 100 years older. 

It makes zero sense. I think we need to send up GPS satellites, and NOT make their clocks tick 37 microseconds slower per day, because i am 100% certain they would work JUST fine even without adjusting for time dilation. I think the idea that GPS wont work without adjusting for a minor 37 microseconds per day is bs. Lets TEST it out without adjusting it first.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont get why light is so important that it has the ability to slow down an ENTIRE DIMENSION or PART OF A DIMENSION KNOWN AS SPACETIME, even though light is just a property/phenomena of spacetime, to the point that time bends over for light and slows down so that light can always travel at the same speed no matter who observes it.

Question, If Im observing from earth and see a spaceship whizz by at 99% c and its headlights are on, what speed will the light coming out of it be travelling at? wont i just see it travel at c plus 99% c? or will i see it just pulling ahead slightly from the ship at 1% of c? Could I observe the ships time or length slow down?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that if i am gonng 99.9999% of c and lets say my time slows down, Earths time wont slow down. So does this mean on my ship if im going circles around the earth at about 1,000,000 miles away, EArth would look like its in fast forward mode or something like a cassete tape being fast forwarded?

3286,hbxxn0,Boltzmann Brain Illogical?,"I read about the Boltzmann Brain (BB) and my understanding is that it is a functioning brain formed randomly in space that may only exist for an instant before being destroyed, but that instant may feel like a lifetime (in the form of hallucinations/electrical inputs) to the consciousness (?) within it. I read somewhere that it is much more likely that I am a BB than I am a brain that formed after billions of years of evolution. I’m not totally buying this argument’s scientific validity, but for the sake of this argument I will assume it’s correct. I had two issues with this idea and I’m wondering if anyone actually believes this (if you aren’t just signals in my floating, fleeting brain somewhere in space). First, if I was a BB why would science exist? Why would things be repeatable and measurable and logical instead of irrational and non-repeatable. I have dreams that often times do not have logic or follow scientific principles. What could possibly make a BB, even part/most of the time adhere to repeatable logical scientific principles? I concede the preceding argument is not strong at all because I’m making a lot of assumptions about what a BB should work like based on my observations in a possibly non-existent world. But this brings me to my second, and I think much stronger, point. The idea of a BB and the conclusion that it would be more likely that we are actually a BB than a product of billions of years of evolution, is based on ones understanding of the principles and science of this world, but if we were a BB those aren’t actually the rules of the reality that the BB exists in. Why logically would the physics/scientific rules of the BB’s hallucinations perfectly match with the actual physics/scientific rules of the actual reality the BB exists in. Seems like this is paradoxical/contradictory. I would say it’s very unlikely I am a BB. Wondering what anyone’s thoughts on this are.

TLDR; if your existence is a hallucination created by a fleeting brain randomly formed in space how can you rely on data or rules from your hallucination to say something (specifically that a brain is more likely to form randomly in space than through billions of years of evolution) about the true reality that the brain exists in.",5,2020-06-19 04:55:39,physics

Maybe as oscillations between 'pn' and 'np' by some pi+ exchange? (but shouldn't it make it a linear antenna producing EM waves?)

As space and time are essentially the same thing, this would imply that these two particles would also react no matter how far apart in time they were.

So then, in theory, couldn't we:

1) Create some kind of observational device whose particles that record information are entangled with another set of particles 
2) Then, we could accelerate one of the pair to near c, which would change it's relativistic time in comparison to the other set, and thus one set would be in the future but entangled with the set in the present 
3) Based on this, we could observe future changes with the entangled sensor?

My question is : Given that burning matter for energy is pathetically inefficient and given that both fission and fusion yield only .08% and .7% conversion efficiency of mass into energy respectively 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be possible to somehow turn our sun into a blackhole? To increase energy output for the recreation of mass as well as help us delay the death of the solar system and universe? If the Sun is expected to last another 5 billion years then if it were a blackhole it could last much longer, it would allow us to use more of the energy to recreate matter which would eventually be resent back into the blackhole in a timely manner convenient for us and it would allow us to stay in this solar system for longer. It would either allow more humans to be born or it would prolong the existence of currently living humans

3336,hbeuhu,Industry or Academic Job Before Applying to Physics PhD?," 

Hi all. I have been working in a biophysics lab at a large research hospital in Boston since I graduated in 2018 with the goal of going to medical school. However, a few months ago I realized that I no longer wish to go to medical school and I have instead decided to pursue a PhD in physics (which is what I majored in in college), possibly pursuing biophysics or quantum computing, though I am open to any specialty. Since I was preparing for medical school throughout all of college, I now have to switch gears and do everything required of a physics PhD (GRE, Physics GRE, etc.) so I have decided to take another two gap years and apply in 2021 for 2022 matriculation.

I am getting bored of my current academic research role and so I have been applying to jobs in both industry and academia for the past month or so. I have two interviews coming up, one at a large pharma company where I would be doing small molecule drug discovery work and the other in a different large research hospital using lasers and doing cool physics-y stuff related to medicine (so, kind of biophysics again). I am more interested in the work being done in the academic position and I would likely have the opportunity to publish more and do more independent projects, but the pharma job would pay probably twice as more.

My question is basically, how do I weigh the money I could be making in industry versus the potential for publication and more independent work I'd get in the academic role? Do either of these matter to a physics graduate admissions committee? I would have to imagine that doing academic research would be more amenable to succeeding in a PhD program, but also money.

An average  person to lift a rock of 60 kg with his arms is extremely harder than to lift himself ""60 kg "" up with his arms holding a bar.This means the muscles force used to raise his body is far less than the force used to lift a mass with the same value. 

I can jump high raising my massive 60 kg body using only my thigh's muscles but if we put a rock of 60 kg on my thighs  the thighs not only impossible to lift the 60 kg rock but there is a possibility to break my legs.

A person can walk upside down on his arms lifting his massive body which implies that he uses force far less than his weight and far less than the force needed to lift a mass with the same value"" 60 kg""

I can raise up my massive 60 kg body mass when trying to pick a fruit from a tree with only my feet and calf muscles's .In fact the lifting will be easy that I will not use my calf's and feet muscles maximum force.

The idea is when it is about a human body the muscles need a remarkably small force to lift the human which is less than the body weight  , but when it is a bout another mass the muscles need greater force which is bigger than the mass weight.",0,2020-06-18 07:21:46,physics

This would total 9,261,000,000,000,000,000,000 cubes. All cubes would be numbered, using 22 algarisms (21m\^3= 22 digits). 

The website is on github, you can visit going to: [CubicPostcode.com](https://CubicPostcode.com)

This would have many applications; particularly cool with augmented reality, semantic web and new ways of world mapping for propriety house register and real estate.

9,261,000,000,000,000,000,001 to 9,999,999,999,999,999,999 could be codes used for moving items, like telephone numbers, ISBNs, RFIDs or IP addresses. Everyone would get used to this string codes of 22 algarisms.

Looking for someone that could collaborate with me in the algorithm design and code implementation.

Work in progress with a little script in Python that converts cube number into XYZ cartesian coordinates, In case you might be interested we have also HTML5 / JS code to convert GPS &lt;-&gt; XYZ cartesian coordinates in meters. 

Here: [https://github.com/cubicpostcode/LLA\_ECEF\_Conversion](https://github.com/cubicpostcode/LLA_ECEF_Conversion)

&amp;#x200B;

In case you ask, I know about ""what3words"", sure, but it is a proprietary system. Also, the words get clunky and there are many languages that don't use the English alphabet making it much more clunky. Algarisms are much more widely used and better for a universal, compact and unambiguous system. Also, my proposed cubic postcode includes all places on Earth volumetrically, not just the surface and creates an interesting aesthetical appeal for monument architectonical creations.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if we used 22 algorisms strings for everything, including phone numbers, we would not need international prefixes in our phone numbers. We could use these 22 algarism strings for everything, including phone numbers without prefix, etc. as described in the cubicpostcode website.

&amp;#x200B;

What3words is interesting but slightly flawed. Being proprietary makes it more likely to be widely adopted as they can afford advertisement and infrastructure development. But still, I think this system is much better. Simple, compact, universal and elegant.

I'm locked down with a novel measurement setup with a photo-multiplier tube in a makeshift dark room (formerly known as a wardrobe).

Shocked, they turn the question back to you and ask, ""how do you know that matter exists in your world, then? What if matter is nothing more than a series of rules for how *information*, rather than matter, might interact?""  


I assume the closest might be calculations involving mass, perhaps, but these equations appear (at least in my estimation, and I am not a physicist, hence my question to you) to describe how certain rules ought to operate with other rules.

3429,hallot,The thicker wire is the stronger magnetic fields are induced in a solenoid,"Recently I've found a video on youtube which shows how to make an engine of a solenoid and a nail.
I thought that would be a cool project to try.
What I needed to figure out is whether there's a difference in using thick and thin wire. So I've made some calculations:


1.  We have two wires with radius: r and 2r


2. Assume that we have a finite space to wrap the wire around. Let it be a metal strip which's radius is 6r and lenght 20r.


3. Firstly we calculate how many times we can wrap the wire around the strip:

3.1. N1 = 20r / (r * 2) = 10 ;

3.2. N2 = 20r / (2r * 2) = 5 ;


4. Secondly we need to know the lenght of those wires: 

4.1 L1 = 2 * 3,14 * 6r * 10 = 376,8r ;

4.2 L2 = 2 * 3,14 * 6r * 5 = 188,8r ;


5. What's more we need to know the current flowing through the wires. Assume that our energy source provides 12V. We use Ohm's law to find the current I =U/R. Well now we need the resistance and we get it from formula: R = ρ * L/S. To make calculations easier assume that ρ = 1:

5.1 R1 = 376,8r / (3,14 * (1r)^2) = 120 / r ;

5.2 R2 = 188,4r / (3,14 * (2r)^2) = 15 / r ;

5.3 I1 = 12 / (120 / r) = 0,1r ;

5.4 I2 = 12 / (15 / r) = 0,8r ;


6. Finally we put it all into a final formula which calculates the strenght of a solenoid induced magnetic field. B = (μ * I * N) / L, again to make things easier assume that μ = 1:

6.1 B1 = (1 * 0,1r * 10) / 376,8r = 1 / 376,8 ;

6.2 B2 = (1 * 0,8r * 5) / 188,4r = 1 / 47,1 ;


Conclusion: clearly B2 &gt; B1. That means it is better to use thicker wire making a solenoid.

I like it, and the artist was a saint for working with me for free and splitting his audio into something the XY galvos could eat, and any statement to the contrary is a contractual obligation to send me your rights-free mixtape with separated tracks.

  * I used rolling shutter tricks to get the curvy light. It's not real. I feel like the smarter asses probably figured that out by now, but then I got lost in this thought about how all light is observed on a rolling shitt--Nevermind! I also filled the chamber with like 50$ worth of quinine. Total waste of tonic. I couldve drank that.

* Idea: That got me thinking...if the tank had a compressible medium with a standing compression wave set up inside (speaker, transducer, really angry opera singer), the beam would actually ""curve"" due to the demsity and therefore IOR gradient, no matter how slight. (See also: [mirages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage)) 

  * Liquid gradients are the better proof of concept, but often rely on irreversible concentration gradients to get smooth bending. But if any of the optics people have cheaper ideas I'm all ears.

* Questions: 

 * A) Imagine we have a magic, fluorescent gas with similar properties to air. How big would this chamber have to be/how much compression would we have to achieve to get a &gt;5^o deflection of the beam? (I shot the actual video on mute, so short of exploding the tank, you could get away with quite a bit of compression.)

 * B) Has anyone else built a beam steering chamber like this? Searches on the last project point to ""yes, but not as cool looking because we're a bunch of nerds who want to better humanity through practical applications instead of doing stupid shit"". The investigation was inconclusive tho.

3597,h8v8fv,I dislike Einstein. Change my mind.,"Albert Einstein is by many considered as one of the smartest scientist of the past century. While I don't disagree with that, I tend to consider his work a direct consequence, although far from being trivial, of Lorentz's and Maxwell's work.

It was Lorentz and Maxwell to postulate a framework where there is a maximum velocity that is invariant for all inertial frames of reference, and that speed was the speed of light.

Maxwell had a great humility in writing his equations without trying to assume any philosophical meaning, but considering them just as a pure work of math. Many other scientists contributed to his work, Lorentz in primis, but I regard Maxwell as the catalyst for classical electromagnetism.

Many times in the history of humanity there has been important breakthrough in science, carried out by independent teams working separately, see Newton vs Leibniz on the topic infinitesimal calculus. Great minds acts as lightning rods for the scientific culture around them, by synthesizing in a succinct and coherent framework the ideas of their times. Maxwell was the catalyst of electromagnetism, and Einstein's work produced relativity, but I regard Maxwell's equations as the true breakthrough, which helped us to move away from classical physics.

On the other hand many times Einstein tried to make philosophical deductions from his work, infamous is the quote ""God doesn't play dices"", which he used to discredit the newly born quantum physics. I think this is a sign of arrogance, which presume that physics gives us a deep understanding of nature, and not just a simplistic model which is neither right nor wrong, but just an approximation of the universe.

Every time I hear Einstein quoted as the prototype of scientist, I think about Maxwell, Heaviside, Lorentz and others, and I think that them would be would much better represent the figure of a scientist.

Am I too dismissal of Einstein's work? What do you guys think?",7,2020-06-14 09:54:47,physics
3598,h8v6s0,Can a big enough space region (of radius R) that doesn't contain any black holes contain more mass than the Schwarzschild limit for a black hole with the same radius R?,"Say a galactic civilization started pushing stars densely enough to create a huge globular cluster. Could the cluster ever become big and dense enough so that its density exceeded the Schwarzschild limit without its space being a black hole?

As supermassive black holes get bigger and bigger theoretically their event-horizon sphere can have miniscule mass density if they got big enough because the surface area (not the volume) of a black hole is proportional to its mass. This means that an ""infinite"" black hole would have mass density zero.

This way, a big enough globular cluster could have density large enough to exceed the supermassive black hole's density. Does that mean that everyone outside the globular cluster would perceive it as a black hole in a way that people inside it could never leave it because of its central gravity (not even light) but inside there could normally live civilizations?

In the same manner, could our universe be such an area?

I made a small program in Python with which I calculated the radius of a black hole if it had the density of our universe and the value was 13.4 billion light-years. Is that a coincidence or there's more to it?

3599,h8v1wv,I think I figured out what dark matter is," 

All matter is dark matter. And exists as a probability in the 4th dimension (time). It is only when 2 elements of dark matter interact, that the probabilities must be determined in order to determine the interaction. At that point the dark matter probability becomes a “regular matter” particle (collapse of the wave function), but only for as long as the interaction occurs, at which point the regular matter particles become dark matter probabilities again (their natural state).

The “interference” pattern in the double slit experiment isn’t an interference pattern. It’s a “probability” pattern. It shows you the probability that the particles took a certain path. If you force the dark matter probability into 3 dimensional reality by interacting with it, the “probability” pattern disappears, because the probability was destroyed in the interaction. When you cover one of the slits, the **particle passing thru the remaining slit** forces it into 3D reality because we know which slit it passed thru, so no probability pattern. You could do the double slit experiment with an unlimited number of slits, and you will get the probability pattern until all but one of them are covered. Because then we know which slit it went thru, forcing the particle into our reality. Also, you could put the slits 200 miles apart from each other, and if you fired enough photons, the probability pattern would appear on the screen behind.  If I’m right, if you shrink the size of the slits, you reduce the probability of a successful path, so it would take more photons to get the same number of hits on the detector screen. Also, I think it would be super interesting if the detection screen surrounded the entire experiment instead of just a panel behind the slits. Think Professor X’s Cerebro, but made of particle detectors. What patterns would emerge over time? What pattern would emerge if they were circles instead of slits? I think the shape of the opening would be determinative of the probability of successful paths to the detector.

Also, I don't think quantum mechanics and relativity are marry-able.  When a particle is not interacting, it is dark, and subject to the rules of quantum mechanics. When it IS interacting, it is a regular matter particle, subject to relativity. They both apply to all particles, just at different times. 

Particles are not waves. The “wave” behavior is probability, not interference.",0,2020-06-14 09:44:28,physics

Another example is time dialation, when one experiment is carried out at stationary speeds while the other is carried out in a rocket traveling near the speed of light, the experiments would just progress at different rates right?

3618,h8r08t,I think I have a visual understanding on how radio waves are created by an antenna. Is it correct?,"So for the last 3 years I've been trying to learn how radio waves are produced by antennas. I've learned how electric fields and magnetic fields work and even managed to teach myself a tiny amount of vector calculus to understand the Maxwell Equations. I've watched many videos on how radio waves are produced and every single one either skips over the actual changing fields and goes straight to the equations (which I don't understand) and how it is recieved. Plus, some videos have oversimplified to the point of being useless to me. But after some brain storming (and head slamming) I think I've figured it out and am using animations to explain what I think.

Please tell me if I'm right (finally!) or if what I think is completely wrong.

#Explanation:

The two Maxwell equations involved are: Faraday's Law and Ampere's Law which say that a changing magnetic field creates a curl in the electric field and vice-versa.

So say we have a straight wire and we run a current through it. We know that the magnetic field around this wire will be in a loop

[Example](https://imgur.com/LxJqlHZ)

Next, we know from Faraday's Law that the curl of the electic field is related to the rate of change of the magnetic field. If we only look at one magnetic field vector, the electric field around it would like something like:

[This](https://imgur.com/ki8E4M4)


With the electric field curling around the magnetic field while it's increasing. If we go back to the original animation, and add in the electric field vectors, it would look something like:

[This.](https://imgur.com/JTWuUKU) And if we make it look less crowded by looking at only two magnetic field vectors it would [look like this](https://imgur.com/qVvWGTW).

Now, because there are [magnetic field loops above, below, and before](https://imgur.com/ap1RRC7) the electric field loops that have their own electric field loops, all vectors in the loop get canceled out except for the ones pointing up.

So now, just looking at one magnetic field loop, the electric field it creates would look something like:

[This](https://imgur.com/ihQyb5e)

Now this electric field that was created by the magnetic one will have its own magnetic field loop. And that magnetic field loop will have its own electric field loop and it keeps on going back and forth. This chain reaction loop doesn't happen instantly through space and takes time. More specifically it spreads out through space *exactly* at the speed of light. [This can be seen in this animation.](https://imgur.com/Q3yp7WZ)

Finally, looking back at the slice of the wire, [we can see the chain reaction spreading outward](https://imgur.com/SmgMYIc) when current is first increased in the wire.

Now in reality, the electric and magnetic vectors in the animations are actually not separated (it was just to show movement forward in space) and the wave would look something like [this](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imgel2/emwavec.png). The wave shown in the image is a sine wave while our one might look more like a single peak and then zero.",37,2020-06-14 04:56:34,physics

Also, assuming the rotation of the ship is stationary, how fast will the ship be rotating around the roll axis (°/s) after, say, 10s of continuous firing.

3974,gymh07,College Major,"Hey

I'm going to be attending undergraduate college as a freshman this fall as a physics major, and I have a few questions.

I have enough credits to graduate in 3 years, but if i double major in math I would be able to do that in 4 years. I enjoy physics a lot, but I also enjoy math. I feel like if it comes down to personal preference of whether I want to commit to the math double major or not, I wouldn't be able to make a decision because I certainly like doing math. I plan on applying to graduate schools and jobs after getting my bachelors degree, so would it be more impressive to have a physics degree in 3 years or to have a physics + math degree in 4 years? I've also been reading that if I want to go into theoretical or experimental physics, having that extra math knowledge would be helpful, but at this point in time, I really don't know what type of physics I want to specialize in. I'm hoping that I'll be able to figure that out while taking certain classes during college. I should also add that the physics and math major at my school have all the same lower division courses except I need 1 extra coding class in C++ for math, so adding it on wouldn't be too hard in the first 1-2 years (hopefully).

So what if the reference angle is the negative i axis (south or north of west) or the positive j axis, or something else? How should I set up expressions?

Consider a set of N noninteracting point particles confined to a volume V.  These particles appear indistinguishable.  Then by classical statistical theory the entropy of the system is proportional to ln(V^N).

Now, say we are suddenly made aware that one of these particles fluoresces at a distinct wavelength, or can otherwise be considered distinguishable.  For the sake of simplicity, we will ignore instrument limitations and quantum effects and assume the particle's position and momentum can be tracked with arbitrary precision using this fluorescence.  Then the system can be considered to be comprised of 2 independent subsystems, that of the distinguished particle and that of all the others.  Then the entropy can be seen to be proportional to ln(V^N-1) + 0 (as the distinguished particle has no uncertainty in it's position or momentum).

I have obtained two distinct values for the entropy of the system, but the physical system has not changed at all, only our knowledge of it.  The problem becomes worse if you allow more or all of the particles to be technically distinguishable in the same manner - we obtain N different values for the entropy depending on how many particles we have knowledge about.  This seems to suggest an inconsistency in the definition of entropy for physical systems based only on our knowledge of them.  Can somebody point out the flaw in my argument, which assumptions were unjustified, or otherwise point me in the right direction to understand the relationship between the entropy of a system and the knowledge we have about it?

3991,gyerg4,Observational relativity in the definition of entropy,"I have been thinking about the definition of entropy recently and have come across an interesting thought experiment that leads me to believe I don't have a complete grasp on it.  I want to preface this by saying I am a recently graduated Bachelors in chemistry, and have taken an intro to statistical mechanics but definitely am not any sort of expert.

Consider a set of N distinguishable, noninteracting point particles in a box with volume V.  These particles can be distinguished and tracked, the mechanism of which is irrelevant; to give a physical grounding, lets say they all fluoresce at distinct wavelengths.  Let us initially assume we are ignorant to these wavelengths or for some reason cannot track the particles; that is, although they are technically distinguishable, they appear indistinguishable to us.  Then statistical theory says the entropy of the system will be proportional to ln(V^N) as the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium.

Now, say we are suddenly made aware of the fluorescent wavelength of one of these particles; using this information we are able to track it's position and infer it's momentum.  To simplify the argument, I will ignore quantum effects and allow this precision to be arbitrarily good.  Then we can consider the system to be composed of two subsystems, that of the distinguished particle and that of the other N-1 particles.  As entropy is additive in independent systems, this system now has entropy proportional to ln(V^(N-1) + 0) (as there is no uncertainty in the position and momentum of the distinguished particle).  This procedure can be repeated for any subset of the particles to give many different values for the entropy.

Nothing has changed about the physical system other than our knowledge of it, but many different values for it's entropy are obtained.  This seems to indicate an inconsistency in the definition of entropy dependent only on our awareness of and ability to measure information about the system.  Can anybody help me to understand where my thought experiment fails or otherwise better understand entropy in relation to information known about the system?

A ball has the mass of 25gram and the volume of 12.5cm\^3 hanging from a tree. The ball is then dropped into a glass of water. Whats Lifting power does the ball have on the water?

So i setup the principle: P= density x volume x  acceleration of gravity.

I figure out the density by using Density= Mass/Volume

But now im stuck. The acceleration of gravity is 9,82m/s\^2, but the volume has cm\^3. If i were to calculate the density then i'd get 25/12.5 which would give me 2g/cm\^3 right.

If i were to put these values into the principle then it'd be P= 2g/cm\^3 x 12.5cm\^3 x 9,82m/s\^2 which doesnt feel right since i have both cubic centrimetre and m/s\^2. Should i try to convert the values?",0,2020-06-07 07:00:41,physics

When two cars collide head-on, the lighter car is at a disadvantage: as a result of its faster deceleration, its occupants experience much greater g-forces. [SOURCE](https://www.iihs.org/topics/vehicle-size-and-weight)

Consider the following scenario:

Car A has a curb weight of 3500 lbs.
Car B has a curb weight of 4000 lbs.

Assuming identical safety systems in both cars, and ignoring passenger weights, if car A and B collide head-on, the passengers in car B are more likely to survive.

Now consider this:

Let's say we put a few sandbags (weighing a total of 1000 lbs) in the trunk of car A.

So now, car A weighs 4500 lbs whereas car B still weighs 4000 lbs.

Here is a serious question:

If these two cars were to collide head-on again, ignoring passenger weights and assuming identical safety systems, is car B now at the exact same weight disadvantage with its passengers less likely to survive?

I'm a power engineering student coding a simple n-body simululation in C for my computer science class. I'm trying to use 4th order Runge Kutta method to increase the accuracy of the simulation, however I've encountered a problem. I set up a simple system with just two bodies, one central body with high mass and another negligibly small body orbiting it. For the purpose of calculating simulation errors I wrote a short piece of code that takes the average energy (kinetic and potential) of the smaller body from last 100 iterations and compares it to its initial value. I noticed that that the orbit slowly but steadily drifts outwards. I thought it was to be expected, but then I tried calculating the error using the same method for a more brute force approach of running g = GMm/r\^2 over and over again without any corrections. To my surprise while the orbit seemed to be slightly eliptical and precessed a bit, the total energy didn't budge over tens of millions of iterations.

Does anybody have any idea how to make RK4 method more stable over long periods of time? Do errors come from my implementation of RK4 or is there a problem with method itself?

Let's agree that quantum physics violates local realism. E.g. an entangled pair of particles is correlated and when they decohere, they immediately alter the state of the other particle. Measurement alters the state of the particles, so we can't speak of realism. Since they influence each other faster than speed of light, we can't speak of locality either.

So we agree, that the pair is perfectly correlated. But how can we be certain, that this happens through entanglement, and not by a ""split superposition upon creation""? Let's say, they are entangled for a short time during creation but instantly decohere on their way to the detectors.

I mean, they would behave exactly the same when measured? The argument to say, that the probability doesn't add up for this case does not make sense to me. Since it neither would add up for an entangled pair. How can we know, that the pair is still entangled till the first measurement? If we can't say this for certain, both explanations are possible and every argument against such a theory could be used against entangled correlation as well.

Right from the start we are asked to accept two presumptive nature's of reality which have not been proven. 

First we must believe that there are other universes beside our own. We have theories that are backed by mathematics, which I admittedly do not understand, that explain how other universes could exist in theory. The issue is there is no way to prove or disprove these hypotheses.

The truth of the matter is (no pun intended) we don't even know what amount of space the observable universe takes up in our own universe. We know that it's expanding, but what is it expanding into? Nothingness? What is nothingness? Is there a limit to it? There are limits to how small something can be, like a point particle. Could there also be limits to how large something could be? How do we know there is enough space for the space? My point is, we have no reference point to measure or judge by in order to make any reasonable predictions about things so outside the scope of our reality. We are like goldfish trying to understand algebra. 

So for Mr. Holt to say with such certainty that our universe is unexeptionable when our universe may be the only universe, thus rendering it by its very nature the MOST exceptional, seems like a rather grandious and arrogant statement. For all we know, our observable universe may be like a point particle compared to the rest of the universe. 

Second, let's presume that there are other universes wandering in the ether of nothingness which we do not comprehend. we are then asked to believe that these other universes have different laws of physics than our own. 

Someone please explain to me why our mathematics which are based solely on our laws of physics would ever point to laws which abide outside of its own domain? This in itself would break the laws of Physics. The act of proving with mathematics something which is not possible within that mathmatecial framework is impossible.

Third, this idea ignores the even larger question of ""why is there something rather than nothing."" Even if there are multiple universes and those universes do have different laws of physics. Why are those universes there in the first place? Who created God? 

By saying that our reality is inconsequential and average Jim Holt blindly ignores that if there is a reality outside of our own reality, then we are now living in a reality where that reality is a reality. Making it our reality. Meaning that if there is a reality anywhere that could be deemed exceptional, we by default live in a reality in which that reality is encompassed.

Ok, cool beans, may as well have some fun with them.  So far, I have done three things that were really interesting.     
     
1) Measured the ratio of beta decay (cesium-137) to gamma decay (barium-137m) as 92.1% which is super cool because [according to Wikipedia at least the accepted value is 94.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-137#Decay).    
    
2) Demonstrate that beta decay is affected by a magnetic field (using some neodymium magnets) while gamma emission is not.    
     
3) Demonstrate that gamma rays can be reflected by a mirror.  I did this using a [mirascope parabolic reflector toy I bought on amazon](http://physicstoys.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-mirascope.html).
    
Super neat stuff.  I always like being able to test things I read for myself (I mean really, what scientist doesn't).    
    
I studied astrophysics in college but I love the field as a whole.  Didn't do much with nuclear physics beyond measuring the half-life of (looking at my own lab write-up here from ages ago) ironically barium-137m that we some how acquired through ""milking"" and I don't remember what that means.    
    
Anyway, I kinda ran out ideas so I thought I would pose the question to people who know way more about this kind of stuff than myself.  What neat experiments can I do with this drunkenly acquired physics toy?

4160,gwqyqv,Why are physicists consistently considering models that are breaking the symmetries of the theory they are expressed in?,"Physics theories are always constrained by symmetry principles (Strong equivalence principle, Galilean invariance principle, Gauge invariance, …).  

This means that each model of a theory inherits (by construction) the symmetries enforced by the theory. For example, in classical mechanics, every model is (supposedly) Galilean invariant (no absolute frame of reference, invariance by rotations, translations, boosts, …).  

Now, take the classical expression of the Lorentz force: it depends explicitly on v and and cannot therefore be Galilean invariant. The same is true for the harmonic oscillator F = -kx or the central force F = -1/r\^2. In these cases, an absolute frame of reference is defined because an absolute point is discriminated (the origin) from all others.   

As these models are not Galilean invariant, we should not expect them to preserve energy, momentum, angular momentum or any other quantity related to these broken symmetries (say, by Noether theorem).  

How to explain that in some case the conservation laws are preserved while they a priori have reason to be, say, for the central force?  It seems to me that we cannot even know when it i the case, so why are we even using them to begin with?

4178,gwiota,Kinetic Energy &amp; Projectile Impact,"First, what I think I understand based on some light Wikipedia reading and a response on the physics discord. Kinetic energy is the point energy of an object with respect to its mass and velocity. What it does not take into account is the surface area of the object over which the kinetic energy would be transferred through upon making contact. Please correct any misunderstandings here.

What I am trying to do is calculate the force applied with respect to the surface area of a bullet making contact with a target. Originally, I thought that I could perhaps divide the kinetic energy by the rough cross-sectional surface area of the bullet to arrive at some value representative of its force over its given area, however, this seems to give some irrational answers.

An example would a 9x19mm Luger bullet (for the sake of using metric). The muzzle energy given by the manufacturer of a 115 grain (about .0075kg) FMJ is 356 ft-lbf (about 483J). Dividing the energy, 483J, by the rough forward-facing surface area of a 9mm cylinder, 63.6 mm^(2) (because using square meters gives astronomically high numbers when dividing) gives you about 7.6J/mm^(2). Is there anything wrong with doing this operation? Does it give any misleading or completely wrong answers? 

The reason I'm attempting to do such calculations is to understand the different impacts of different calibers of munitions traveling at various speeds with respect to the surface area they will roughly make contact with. What I am not attempting to account for is various bullet compositions (FMJ, JHP, Frangible, Lead, etc.) or bullet shape (5.56mm being somewhat conical vs 9mm being fairly hemispherical). Obviously these things factor into how a bullet will react when striking a hard surface but are less important to me for comparisons between different diameters and energies.

Any help in confirming or destroying my assumed method to compare munitions would be appreciated. Thank you.",1,2020-06-04 09:39:18,physics

I'm currently a first year university student taking physics courses. As I've always been interested in STEM - mainly physics and engineering - and did/do great at maths (national/federal state olympiad level, not just high school courses) I thought that the obvious choice for me would be to major in physics and not engineering as I could use my strengths in maths better in this subject.

However, the thought of ""creating"" and doing applied science always appealed to me way more than the sole pursuit of understanding our nature. Thus I planned to specialize in applied physics (condensed matter, quantum information) and to not go into academia but to rather join a startup etc.

Lately I've been thinking a lot about switching to engineering (EECS) as I think that with the goal of ""creating"" in mind, it would just not make sense to major in a subject that mainly consists of purely theoretical courses whereas EECS would give me many opportunities to conduct research and to specialize in applied fields (robotics, nanoelectronics, energy, etc.).

4208,gwayuu,"[QUESTION] Has anyone into physics and cosmology ever tried DMT? How close to reality are these ""revelations""?","I ask because some of the ""ideas"" that are given in such experiences suggest things about the true nature of reality, which seem to in some cases as far as I am aware actually match with scientific literature. I'm not as sure it happens on solo DMT but with a combo of a psychedelic and DMT or HEAVY meditation it does...

As one example on one trip I saw ""the"" sheet of existence. One singular giant sheet and it's all of existence. And the thing it told me is that nothing that ever exists can ever not exist, if you're on this sheet of existence you can never leave this sheet.

And from what I currently know of physics or was taught in school, this seems correct because matter cannot be destroyed only transformed or changed in some way etc...

And it's weird to me if that's accurate that a hallucinogenic compound would put into my mind true revelations about the nature of reality.

The other sense which is reached either on very heavy mixed trips or meditative states is the sense of oneness... That everything derives from one like leaves on a tree, where the tree is the one singular everythingness... And again I am not sure if this is true, but we are made from the atoms of dying stars right? And much like this told me, the singular sheet of existence simply takes the leaf (so in this case a star) and spits it back out as something else, supposedly eventually being spat out in the expression that is us.

So again if that's a true thing and not a drug delusion it's bizarre to me how and why it would impart such knowledge.

That is really the bottom of the rabbithole. There are no entities (if they exist they are a part of ""it"" meaning a part of spacetime), no creators (if there's a creator it's outside of our sheet of existence so we could never interact with it)...

Just the singular ""oneness"" that makes up everything there ever was and ever will be.

4259,gvm0m0,How to Learn Physics: Self-Study vs Curriculum?,"Hey, I am a first-year undergraduate studying physics (obviously...), but I just feel that it is too slow. 

Not in that the matter is easy but the fact that they (they being the university) are moving forward very slowly and in an inefficient manner. From what I have found, physics curriculums in university prepare you for the application and analysis of the concepts, they don't focus on the concepts themselves, how they were derived and how they connect to other ideas. They teach Classical Mechanics and focus on the formula without talking about their origins, their meaning, and their past. Maybe it is just me but I want to understand the idea first, through the eyes of the scientist who discovered them. I think that if I understand the idea the math is fairly intuitive and then I can VERY clearly see the picture of the laws at work in my head. Therefore I don't like the way they teach physics, however, I do like their curriculum because it gives you a clear path of what to learn in succession. 

On the other hand, I love self-studying. I am highly driven by myself and work really hard when I want to do something so laziness is not a problem during self-studying. I love reading about the experiments which lead to the logical derivation of the laws. So if I can, I prefer to self-study. However, during self-study, I do stab-in-the-dark learning. Meaning I learn about something, then I read an article about it, then a different book or something else. This doesn't build a good base of all of the fundamentals of physics. So it breaks down when I learn about something esoteric. 

I was wondering if there are some books or guidelines I can follow about what to learn to REALLY, REALLY, understand physics. I honestly want to have extreme mastery of the basics to the point where I can learn about other topics outside of physics and then apply the fundamentals and laws of physics to help me understand other streams of science. 

TLDR: I am looking for a way to self learn physics in an efficient manner through experiments and original papers and transcendentals because school fails to capture the beauty in physics. Work is not a problem, I will work in an extreme manner.. :)

tl;dr: do you have mental health issues? How do they affect your research, how do you deal with it, do you think it's possible to be successful in academia with them? Any suggestions on what to do to prepare and keep yourself healthy?

I'm at a stage where I finished something like a 1-year Master's that really took a toll on my mental health due to the stress and overwhelming workload (\~100 hrs per week). I had some serious depression at one stage and some serious burn-out. Not one student in our cohort had a positive experience, and I'm sure more than a handful ended up with depression. Indeed the faculty restructured the whole program for next year after one of the postdocs heard about us and, if I'm not mistaken, went to the dean of science. It was a mess of a program.

Now don't get me wrong, I love physics as much as the next guy. I'm taking a gap year to earn some money to prepare to move overseas, and I really want to go on and do research in the fields that most interest me, but the thing stopping/scaring me from continuing on to a PhD is worry about how to deal with my mental health in the future. I don't expect an academic life to get much easier, but I am worried about whether my mental health will stop me from being able to work as well as is needed to succeed in academia (or have worse consequences).

So to those of you who are doing it, or have done it and made it, what are your thoughts on this? Have you had depression in the past? Do you still have it now? How did/does it affect your research as you've passed through your career? Are/were you able to live a reasonably balanced life?

Quarks are 4 dimension particles and they travel between dimensions one of which is ours. 

Gravity can travel through dimensions. There is force which binds quarks together in our dimension and thus we have atoms(probably weak and strong nuclear forces). Electro Magnetism is a derived force while nuclear forces are inherent to our dimensional reality. Gravity is inherent to parent 4th dimension and we inherit it though it, it's seeping into our dimension. 

The 4th dimension is made of vibrating quarks.

Our parent 4th dimension is either expanding or moving throughout time and we perceive that as our universe getting bigger. The flow of time perceived by us depends on the direction parent dimension is moving.

While watching a softball game you see a play that makes you wonder how fast a fielder can react to a hit, run to the fence, and leap up to make the catch. In this play, the batter hits a ball when it is barely off the ground. It looks like it will be a home run over the left field wall which is 196 ft. from home plate. As soon as the ball is hit, the left fielder runs to the wall, leaps high, and catches it just before it clears the top of the 10.1 ft. high wall.

4274,gvfyck,Something I wanted the world to see.,"Physics is like.. It's amazing. Nothing is truly the same. Every discovery raises new questions. Harder ones. Every application can be improved upon.
Every discovery lights a new perspective. Every problem you solve, is so fking enjoyable, because unless you've done the exact same type of problem before, you will learn something from it. Even the most basic ideas in your head, that you build everything else on? That can be improved too.
Every type of problem you haven't seen before, you have to think to apply what you know in a slightly different way from what you did before.

And the feeling, when you do that? When you are able to see a completely new type of problem that you have never seen before, but are able to apply the exact same concept, in a different way? When you solve it? Even when you figure out a new solution to a previous problem?

I don't know how to explain that. But to me, that is the definition of euphoria

The scientific method is... Insane. You know what I mean, How we started with the most basic of ideas, like addition and subtraction. And we got to where we are now. Just by taking that original idea, applying it a different way to form new ideas. Which give more new ideas. And more. And more and more and more. You know the drill. 

The person who first came up with the number system is almost directly responsible for the construction of the smart phone and supercomputers. Which are applications of SPECIAL FUCKING RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM PHYSICS and all. 

And that is beautiful. How trillions of us helped to get us where we are now. I don't think there's literally anything else that we as a species have collectively worked on, and preserved, and passed on, made mistakes, re evaluated, corrected, made new mistakes. Learnt.

And one the first people to want to calculate did so by counting sheep by keeping the equal amount of rocks with him. So he knew If any were missing, because there would be an extra rock. That simple. 
Just look how far we have come. Starting with such... Basic ideas. That seem so obvious now. But at that time, what that man did was a revolution. But he didn't know that. He started the process of innovation

The fact that what that man and people like him started by comparing sheep and rocks is what made us prove the existence of particles we can't even see, estimate the age of the universe, predict exactly how galaxies and our solar neighborhood move to the extent that we'll know if a black hole is coming our way, millions of years in advance. 

And the fact that the beginning ideas are so basic that what took us millions of years to do, is taught in a span of at a maximum of 2 decades to new learners? That is what I mean. 

And when you study physics, you'll truly know how many misconceptions you'll have, how many mistakes you'll make when you're new to a topic and only have the most basic ideas and your intuition to go by. It's a nightmare. But when you keep trying for weeks, and slowly gain mastery over that topic? The rush... It's exhilarating.

But no one even.... Tries! If there's one thing that I pity people for, it's that. 

The fact that what I'm saying is literally within their reach. Most people's. But physics as a subject is just seen as hard. The outlook on it is just... Infuriating. Because they've convinced yourself people that feel this way do because they're  some kind of genius or something. I hate when people say that.

My point is, they think that physics is something so hard that you wont even try to spend time on it. I'm not saying it isnt hard. But it's no harder than other things. It's not harder than putting in the effort to stay healthy. Exercise, hydration, nutrition, lot of things you have to look for. It's also not harder than many of the other things people do. 

But even when you do try, there's a voice in your head telling you that it's hard. You can't do it. Which makes you quit at the first difficulty.

And It really hurts, when I see people who have the interest for it. And the... Thirst. But who haven't done well enough at school to convince yourself you'll even like physics. I've had the experience of telling someone I know, about calculus. She's in tenth grade, and she doesn't do that well in school. But the interest she showed when I was able to tell her about how a very simple idea had so many applications? It was... I can't put into words how I felt. 

I can't even explain how hurt I feel, when she calls me some kind of a genius for being able to ""dumb it down"" for her. Even though she learned at the exact same pace  I was taught. 

And I'm not criticizing anyone. Thats not the tone I'm going for. I've seen it a lot in almost everyone I talk to,. They don't know how rare their interest is. And even among people with interest, it's rare for people to make an effort to discover it.

And I'm not saying I made an effort. I was lucky. I was good at school. That gave me confidence to tackle new topics, before I realized how being good at school has nothing to do with intelligence.

And what hurts me most, is when the person j was talking about earlier gave up on herself. She's convinced she can't. And I can't convince her she can.",10,2020-06-02 16:11:51,physics

Can you damp the motion of free electrons in a metal using an oscillating magnetic field, such that an electron revolving axially in the direction of the external magnetic field is forced to take an opposite direction of revolution when the external magnetic field is reversed? My goal is to understand whether it's possible to force an electron to give off its thermal kinetic energy, en masse resulting in the metal cooling once removed from the magnetic field. *Basically, have the electron revolve one way, then abruptly the other, and again, and again, till it spirals towards the axis of revolution and thus lose its kinetic energy for a while.*

Yes, this is an idea closely related to magnetocaloric cooling, but I'm talking about damped harmonic motion of electrons, not magnetic domain realignment. Can someone help me with the tools and resources I could use to perhaps simulate such a scenario? Could I use multiphysics software to model free electrons in metal? I've been out of the physics loop a couple of years since high school, but I hope that isn't too much of an impediment for someone trying to explain or refer me to papers (as I don't know what to search for)",0,2020-06-02 05:28:05,physics
4306,gv3o93,Measure distance using sound waves xcorr and iPhone.,"Hi all,  
This app measures the distance between earphone and iPhone.

[https://apps.apple.com/app/id1509013330](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1509013330)  


I am not the maker of the app explicitly, but I did develop the algorithm behind it. The main problem was that any delay caused by the device disqualified the result as 1 nanosecond delayed made the measurement inaccurate. I spent 2 years and made the scientific paper on my University which began my adventure with measuring Sound Waves.

The reason I put it here is that I assume I may be wrong about the algorithms I used. I couldn't find help or another app working like this before, so maybe somebody on this Redditthe  can help or cooperate with me in future.

Just to add - I am not a physicist, but I like challenges. If there are any people that are sound waves masters reading this - we can make many exciting apps together just DM me. I don't know why almost nobody explored this kind of apps before. The next app we will make using the sound algorithms is a thermometer. I already have a proof of concept working. Have a nice day y’all!  


There is a video I put on PH if you want to see how this app works.

I finished last year my bachelor degree in physics and everything went smoothly. I learn a lot. I had good teachers (mostly...) and I wanted to continue to study physics and pursue a career in Particle Physics.

Last semester (my first in the master's degree) wasn't that great. I had an awful professor of advanced quantum mechanics, we didnt learn anything useful, in the last week of the semester he gave the formulas for all of the subjects that we were supposed to cover across the semester and then exam was about everything that we """"""""learned"""""""". I didn't understand anything. It went terribly.

The other classes went ok, I had good grades and learned a lot. But by then I started to feel a bit of regret, in the master's we are expected to understand very deep concepts and subjects in different fields, but the teachers didn't care that much about teaching us those subjects. We were supposed to learn on our own which is doable for one or two classes, but no one has the time to do it for all classes.

Now, I am in the second semester and I am simply hating it. Due to corona virus, I have weekly homework at all classes. I have no free time. I wake up at 8 am and work until 9pm. Including weekends. I am very tired and I am not efficient at all. I am super confused in all classes. In quantum field theory I (and everyone) have no idea what I am seeing. In cosmology the professor only gives us the powerpoint (where is no classes) and expect us to understand everything. It has been horrible for me. I feel that I am just losing my time. I am not learning anything. I feel revolted and tired. Each subject I am taking is interesting on their own, but trying to learn everything at once is undoable without help from the teachers.

Altough I like to code. Most of t

I am sorry for the negativity. I hope your degrees are going as expected.

I am 19 F and a 2nd year student in college pursuing Physics. It has always been something that I wanted to pursue and I intend to become a researcher some day.
I have had trouble with studying some of the concepts in physics, since I am a self-learner mostly. And although i study in a good institute, we are the first batch of undergraduate students since earlier they offered only Master Degree and Phd. As is expected, there are many flaws in this course since we are the first batch and they are improving by experimenting on us. It would surprise you to hear that we had no math methods course. 
I am enrolled into a 5 year integrated Bachelor and Masters course, so that when I am out I have a Master degree. According to this course, it is compulsory to study all the subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology, Computer Science) for 3 semesters (which is almost one and a half year) and then after that we get to chose our majors. So I chose physics. And according to the course structure, the 4th semester (that means my current semester) is going to be a bridge semester, which means from the next sem we are going to be merged with graduate students who will have a 3 year long full fledged course in physics. I know this is unfair, but this is how it is and what cannot be cured has to be endured. So I need to get through this all by myself. 
This period has come as a boon for me since I would hardly have this opportunity again of studying things where i am lacking as a 2nd year physics student. But i am facing a lot of difficulty since I am a self learner and a bit lost on how to go about. 
If there is someone who is reading this and is capable of helping me out, I would be really obliged.

One thing is clear: we will lose something if the engines contain devices in which there is friction. The best engine will be a frictionless engine. We assume, then, the same idealization that we did when we studied the conservation of energy; that is, a perfectly frictionless engine.

We must also consider the analog of frictionless motion, “frictionless” heat transfer. If we put a hot object at a high temperature against a cold object, so that the heat flows, then it is not possible to make that heat flow in a reverse direction by a very small change in the temperature of either object. But when we have a practically frictionless machine, if we push it with a little force one way, it goes that way, and if we push it with a little force the other way, it goes the other way. We need to find the analog of frictionless motion: heat transfer whose direction we can reverse with only a tiny change. If the difference in temperature is finite, that is impossible, but if one makes sure that heat flows always between two things at essentially the same temperature, with just an infinitesimal difference to make it flow in the desired direction, the flow is said to be reversible (Fig. 44–4). If we heat the object on the left a little, heat will flow to the right; if we cool it a little, heat will flow to the left. So we find that the ideal engine is a so-called reversible engine, in which every process is reversible in the sense that, by minor changes, infinitesimal changes, we can make the engine go in the opposite direction. That means that nowhere in the machine must there be any appreciable friction, and nowhere in the machine must there be any place where the heat of the reservoirs, or the flame of the boiler, is in direct contact with something definitely cooler or warmer.

My previous post got taken down for some reason in the astrophysics subreddit so I am trying this subreddit.

Hi, I am new to reddit and the field of practical, applicable physics so my ideas may seem like a crazy, theoretical mess but this is an idea I have been constantly thinking about for a while. I realize now that I may be in the wrong field since I am currently doing Computer Science at college. I guess if there’s one objective thing that can come out of this do you think my ideas are completely insane or do you think they might be possible enough that I should pursue an education in physics to learn more about the mathematics to try and prove some of my ideas?I have a lot more crazy ideas and theoretical justifications for questions that may arise in this paragraph but I didn’t want to put it all in one post because that will just seem like a jumbled mess which it already kind of is. If you have any questions or concerns I would love to justify my thinking in the comments!

Thanks so much for your time!


My idea: We are currently in a black hole in an infinite cycle of universes being born out of black holes (Yes I know that sounds crazy but please hear me out). I believe there are two major ""forces"" dictating how the universe works. I use quotations because they are not exactly quantifiable forces in the way forces are used in today's physics. They are more encompassing of every force in existence. The two ""forces"" are essentially a push and a pull, a positive and a negative force, an action, and a reaction. We see both forces everywhere, the ""negative"" force is mainly facilitated through gravity and other negative forces that we have not identified yet (dark energy/matter?). The ""positive"" force is facilitated by light, time, and other forms that are progressive or move ""forward"" in our current perception of things. Fusion is another such example that uses many positive forces to function and counter the negative forces of gravity. If we can surmise that the two major forces are negative and positive, yin and yang, push and pull, then my initial idea starts to make more sense. The birth of the universe was started from the formation of a singularity that can be seen in nature through the death of huge stars. The overall force of light(fusion) in stars finally succumbs to gravity and gravity collapses everything to a single instant that takes in everything around it. I believe heavily in understanding the scales of the universe better. The scale of our entire scope of existence is so large that it can be pushed and pushed beyond our very basic understanding of how things work now. Relating this back to the 2 major forces, I believe there is a sort of ""cosmic struggle"" between these 2 major forces where everything we see in the universe is created or destroyed based on this ""struggle"" tipping over to a certain direction. If there is a basic, let's call it war, between these 2 forces then it would mean that our current perception of the universe expanding is seen because the ""positive"" force is slightly greater than the ""negative"" force. Now, this relates to my idea that we are in a black hole because if we are in a black hole and if ""existence"" is infinite then it would mean that the scales would have to tip over the other way in which the force of the ""negative"" force would be greater. I believe this naturally occurs by us expanding to the point where we are getting closer and closer to a black hole. The closer we expand towards it, the perceived crunch will occur where it seems like the universe is contracting back (very slowly) to its original singularity when in fact it is actually approaching another singularity where the ""negative"" force (gravity) is so large that it will completely warp our current understanding of physics and understanding of the universe. I can even relate this to the existence of infinite dimensions but that would take a long time to explain. As I mentioned scales before, you can think of it like this to better understand what I am saying. If the 2 basic forces that dictate everything in existence are true then that can happen on many scales such as fusion vs gravity, the birth of singularities, etc.(Even many smaller scales but that is going into quantum physics which I can justify as well); then it must occur on the largest scale we can perceive as well which is our universe. Everything I have explained is a theory that could possibly justify the existence of our current universe using the 2 major forces of existence on a scale that most people don't seem to perceive. All the intricacies of various current forces can be explained through the manipulation of my overarching idea which I would love to justify if there are any specific things that you guys think cannot be explained by my thinking. I can go on and on with theoretical justifications for various questions that may arise from this paragraph so please shoot away in the comments.",6,2020-05-30 18:57:14,physics

I know very little about physics or mathematics I've just researched this particular topic a little bit because of a scene in a book that didn't seem to add up to me. Well, if I knew this, I wouldn't have to ask. My point is, bear with me even if this is the dumbest question you've ever read on here, please.

The other day I came across this essay about relativistic speeds:

[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/Rocket/rocket.html)

In it, it is said that a relativistic rocket, constantly accelerating at a rate of 1g, would need about 12 years in its own time or 113,243 years for a motionless observer to  reach 0.99999999996 c and cross 113,242 lightyears.

Now, what I don't understand about this (as I said, I am not exactly a mathematician) is why this would take so long in the rocket's own time, which I will call Tr. If for every second Tr the Rocket gains 9.81 m/s in speed, then, with pre-relativity math, you'd just divide the speed of light by the acceleration and get a Tr that could never happen, as I had previously understood it. That would be  Tr ≈ 353.7 days.

I figured that meant the ship would simply never reach that point, dilating time as relativity does. But according to the Essay, years, even decades, can pass for the rocket *while it accelerates at 1g*.

How can that be, considering 354 days at a constant acceleration of 1g would bring you to a speed of  300044736  m/s, more than the speed of light? The acceleration can't be slowed down, either, since then it wouldn't be a constant acceleration s was implied in the essay.

The science parts of physics are really fun to learn about, but as soon as one of the math  formulas come up, I have no idea what I'm looking at. Like even the supposed 'basic' kinematic formulas are perplexing, like the displacement curve:

position - initial position = initial velocity (time) + 1/2 acceleration (t)\^2

Although it's supposed to be intuitive, even with the terms plugged in I am confused, and not for lack of trying. I am genuinely interested in learning physics but it's not connecting for me. I plug in all the terms but I always end up getting the numbers wrong, and I have no idea why.

Even though this only has four terms, I don't really understand it. I can get the numbers right in this next formula, but I have no idea WHY it works:

Velocity = Initial Velocity + Acceleration x Time.

Thank you for indulging me this question which I intuitively know is wrong, but cannot explain away. How can black holes actually merge ? Shouldn't their mutual gravitation make the event horizons recede ?

* If we define the event horizon of a black hole as the surface where space is warped so much towards the singularity that there are no escape paths for light to escape. Is it not also true that the presence of another black hole nearby would warp space towards its own center and cancel out this effect in some regions between them ?
* Then does the event horizon of each blackhole recede on the side where they face each other because of their mutual opposite influences ? (And grow on the opposite sides)
* **If this is the case, how can two blackholes merge if their event horizons can never join each other ?**

Another way of looking at it which is more newtonian, and thus more within my grasp.

* If the surface of the event horizon is the collection of points within which the escape velocity needed to leave is greater than c. Wouldn't the presence of another blackhole make the escape velocity needed less than c and thus make the event horizon recede ?

Thank for you taking your time and lifting this off my mind because its a pandora's box of other questions:

* Between any two bodies that exert gravitational influence we can find a surface where the sum of gravitational forces that would apply to an object inside that surface are equal to 0 in any direction perpendicular to the surface. In particular, the point in the middle of the two bodies belongs to that surface. And if the two bodies are of equal mass then that surface is their plane of symetry. 
* In the special case of two black holes, if the event horizons never touch, then is there always a path that along that surface between them that a body can take ? Even if they are arbitrarily close and orbiting around each other like crazy ?

* Does it mean that every object that has mass can never pass through the event horizon from their own perspective because their own mass keeps making the horizon recede and there is always a path between them and the blackhole that stuff can go through and in particular stray from that path in their direction, allowing them to be interacted with ?",0,2020-05-28 21:39:58,physics

I did this because of the simple principle that there are many laws of physics that humans understand, but there is a vastly more that we don't understand. 

The 2 logical friends made the point that witchcraft, as an example,(i'm more talking about the broader idea stated in the post title) would contradict the laws of physics.To which i said, as we know them. 

Ultimately my point is that things that we may personally consider preposterous such as ;witchcraft, magic or religion, can't be definitively ruled out as there's no way we can know everything. And if we do not know everything then there is a chance, no matter how infinitely small that anything could exist/be possible.

4504,gsepb2,I (an Applied Physics undergraduate) want advice in furthering my academic career.,"TLDR: What textbooks and material do you recommend that tackles everything I need to understand the concepts and mathematics leading up the more advanced and theoretical aspects of graduate and post-grad physics?

As the title implies, I’m a 22 y/o undergraduate student currently working towards my bachelors in applied physics at a small CSU. So far this is has been 5 years in the making with (hopefully) two more years worth of classes left and barely entering the upper division courses.

Physics has been a passion of mine since I was 10 years young, however, I feel out of place from other Physics students in my classes in that it has taken me this long to get this far, having to retake some of the upper division classes i started last term. A combination of substance abuse and poor money management has tossed me from uni (SFSU) to community college and back to uni (CSUSM). At this point now, I’m slowly getting back on my feet and onto a solid foothold and support system, ready to put all my effort and momentum into my degree and the physics community as a whole. 

Sob story aside, I know there are a lot of gaps in my knowledge since I’m still relatively very early in my academic career. What I’m asking from the community are some pointers on what subjects, textbooks, and materials to dive into to further my understanding of physics and mathematics.

It might be wishful thinking right now, but in the far future, I want to work towards the theoretical field. Gravity, quantum mechanics, and high-energy physics are areas that tend to equally peak my interest the most (so far, at least). 

My GPA is spotty at best right now, but this last term I just reached back above a 3.0. I know to start looking towards internships as soon as the next year rolls ahead, and before that happens, I want to show my professors that my previous blunders are not representative of what I’m aiming for with this degree. I want to show them I’m fully capable of the more challenging material that’s to come. 

So far, I’ve taken all calculus courses, and am currently looking into taking linear algebra. I will be retaking applied solid-state and electromagnetism, moving on to what comes after. My school in particular does not have much to offer when it comes to physics (there’s more focus on electrical engineering). What textbooks and material do you recommend that tackles everything I need to understand the concepts and mathematics leading up the more advanced and theoretical aspects of graduate and post-grad physics?

And to those of you who made it this far in my spiel, thank you for any help at all! I never really was one to ask for help, but I don’t want this passion and drive to go to waste if I can’t form a game plan for what’s to come. :)",0,2020-05-28 16:00:04,physics

\- Events/workshops going on: a list of events/workshops relevant to undergraduates in the following month.

\- Problem section: a newsletter isn't complete without some entertainment. Problems in 4 categories: Mechanics, E&amp;M, Quantum, Comp'al physics. After the first issue, it would contain a list of the ""winners"" or the previous issue. You'd win by being the first to give a correct solution. 

INPUT DESIRED: Here are some questions:

1. General comments about the format; news, events, problem section. Good enough?
2. Is there some type of content that that you don't currently see, but you'd like to see in newsletters?
3. Frequency of newsletter: is monthly a decent frequency?

Bell’s theorem and locally mediated reformulations of quantum mechanics,"Retrocausality may sound like science fiction, but it might be the best way to explain certain features of the quantum world, as detailed in a major new paper by physicists Ken Wharton and Nathan Argaman. Published in Reviews of Modern Physics, Wharton and Argaman's paper analyses possible ways to model measurements of ""entangled"" particles. One reasonable option, they conclude, is to treat the future choices of experimentalists as inputs, using them to explain past events. This isn't quite time-travel, since those past events remain hidden in quantum uncertainty, but it would be a reversal of the usual direction of causation. The authors conclude that such future-input dependent models warrant further study and development, given that they are more compatible with the theory of relativity than are traditional non-local approaches.

I tried to make a summary of it so you can look the numbers up there (hope you're able to read it). It all results into the astronaut thinking his spaceship is 30 ft long while in reality it is 18ft long. To my question: If the astronaut decides to measure the spaceship with an inch ruler or something like that he would see that the spaceship is 18 ft long and conclude that he is moving. Doesn't that stand in conflict with Einstein's first postulate of the special theory of relativity which says that you shouldn't be allowed to know that you're moving?

Yo, I am a Hermetic Scientist, and a computer scientist. Took physics classes, math classes, programming classes, AWS certified, etc for western education. I am also educated in one part of ancient physics almost no one today remembers, the physics of ancient wisdom. Here is one part of physics that will blow people's minds. The Hermetic Principles are just one part of physics people did not know about. Teaching this stuff is difficult, read on to find out for yourself. I decode the Natural Laws of Hermeticism and Law of One, all just one part of physics you did not know about. 

  

The Hermetic Principles are about physics, so the old Principles still work. It  
 just means you will work with it easier. It is like when you are studying something on your own  
 and suddenly you got a tutor for free. If the other Hermetic texts serve you then it will serve you  
 now, but it should be easier for you to understand.  
 The kybalion refers to mental force on when  
 referring to self-mastery over the material.  
 Law of attraction is Law of One, because you  
 are bringing everything to unity. I see it. I feel it. I be it.  
 Everyone, whether you are man or otherwise, gets the same Teaching in the end, on the same  
 Path back to the Creator. The Creator does not create as much as It experiences. Hermetics are  
 taught that The All is a ""universal living mind."" Sadhguru explains it elegantly when he said,  
 ""consciousness is intelligence beyond memory."" That is simplified version. You are here to  
 help test the energy of the planet and aid in as well as observe the growth or destruction of the  
 planetary consciousness.  
 There is only one Spiritual Law. And the universe is here to help you. All of you to  
 learn it.  
 

When Ra says the chemical body, physical vehicle, astral body, etc, you have many bodies in  
 as far as densities are available to you. Which correlates to higher levels of achievable  
 conscious vibrations. That would seem like infinite and yet you have but one. That of light.  
 Except that is all light in different formats. So just one and yet infinite. The seven rays mean  
 the seven major cosmic centers or chakra, it is not the seven bodies, it is 7 points of  
 frequencies or elevation of consciousness states. Everyone produces light and for those who  
 can see it will see how people can glow in many ways.  
 To align your energy centers, all 7 frequencies just need to be in sync.  
 Each energy center correlates to a certain brightness, rotation is related to frequency and level of vibration.  
 

Isaac Newton was a free mason, he was very into alchemy, knew the Hermetic Principles. Only  
 the very learned and privileged were allowed to learn the Hermetic Principles in the past, the  
 pure, unadulterated, absolute, immutable, eternal doctrine of the Hermetic wisdom. The  
 Hermetic principles are always active. All seven are active, in effect, at once, for eternity.  
 Thoth's tablets and the instructions he left behind still work. You just cannot use it because it is  
 intended for the masters, like Thoth himself. Thoth’s tablet instructions are grid work  
 instructions, you do not need to dip today since the energy field we are in is opening gates more  
 readily, you just need to be smarter. You do not need to follow the instructions Thoth left in the  
 Emerald Tablets. If you ask Thoth for advice, he will just tell you to read his books or tablets.  
 When reading Thoth’s tablets, when he refers to the 7 lords of cycles and the 9, 7 and 9 are the  
 are the council that oversee the solar system. 7 represents the cycle of consciousness of the 7  
 chakras, 9 represents the 9 planets. When reading the tablets, if you were wanting to ask any of  
 the beings he named specifically, you would know what they are when you read it and gain  
 flashes of thought-forms. That would mean you are understanding them. But if not, then you are  
 not ready. If someone does not give you answers, that means you are not ready. What you can do  
 while waiting is you can get wiser. That is why you have mentors that help guide.  
 

Your soul is the intelligent energy or soul-force, but do not focus on it yet, you are not ready.  
 You won’t be ready this lifetime. Especially since you do not understand it on your own. Do  
 not do it, just practice the release of resistance. If you get too greedy, you will pay for it  
 severely, what Thoth wrote in his emerald tablets are for the “ascended masters.” Those  
 masters can do grid work and rejuvenate their bodies, restoring their physical bodies to youth,  
 as much and however many times they want, that is how the myth of ancient yogis or monks  
 or sages who could live for centuries is possible. What Thoth talks about in his tablets is  
 adjusting your vibration, but do not worry about doing that. Just stick with stillness, people  
 are not ready to play with soul-force yet, if ever. People do not yet understand the language  
 that Thoth used to write his emerald tablets. The pyramids in Egypt were just something that  
 helped people calibrate their energies. There are certain points on the planet that have energy  
 concentrations. If a master shows you darkness, this is because you need to understand the  
 darkness to understand the light. The magical influence of the opposites is nothing more than  
 duality.  
 

When working with higher energy, you will risk disintegrating yourself. Or worse, making your  
 nerves go crazy and you could cause irreversible damage to your brain. In which case, can  
 make a person become imbalanced. Not only do you risk your own brain, you could kill  
 yourself and others. By losing control of power you are not meant to play with. No, you would  
 not overload and get zapped. You would be disintegrated and dead. If you try to force your  
 awakening and are not grounded, it’s like putting a magnifying glass on ants on a hot day,  
 that’s why you awaken gently. Center yourself and ground, that’s all.  
 See what I mean by what is above is the same as below, the Hermetic Principle of Correspondence. Your  
 body is a reflection of the elemental mix that is nature. Nature is a reflection of the elementals  
 working together under Gaia. The Sun is the Logos of the Solar System. The Sun’s radiance is  
 “the word.” Then the Sun is sub-Logos under the Logos of the Galaxy, etc. That is what is meant  
 as what is above is the same as below. And the elements carry out the vibrational word of the  
 Logos. The “God force” of that systematic plane. The Logos is administrating good  
 consciousness. Gaia is the Logos of the Earth plane; you are the Logos of your body.  
 Each Logos compass is simply a layer of consciousness that governs a dimensional layer.  
 Basically, there is a Logos for the Sun, one for Earth, one for galaxies, one for black holes, one  
 for nature, friends, you, etc.  
 

The Creator does not have a name, it is also a concept that goes beyond existence and names. Teaching  
 this stuff is difficult, just read on and you will find out what I mean. Once you know  
 something, you cannot unknow it. Does not meant you will have to be skillful with it. Life's  
 lessons are actually spiritual riddles as they are from quantum origins while we are attempting  
 to figure out in linear terms. This is a very profound lesson. These teachings create, move, and  
 shatter worlds. How can I understand reality? Am I attempting to stick linearity into quantum concepts? If you  
 want clarity, see how my answer fits in a quantum fashion. If you stick with linear explanation,  
 you’ll never understand it no matter how hard you try. So the answer is it’s you and it’s not  
 always the oversoul, it’s the Akash but doesn’t have to be past lifetimes or other lifetimes. Your  
 current life diverges when probability brings you choices therefore it diverges to explore all  
 possibilities within choices. And some divergent experiences of probabilities converge within the  
 framework of the same lifetime. Hence Deja vus. Some Deja vus occurs from a divergent energy  
 experience which can be convergence of different lifetimes. Those are akashic presentations  
 pertinent to your learning. Many times, it’s a mixing of everything. See it confusing? Figure out  
 the theme and you’ll be able to conceptualize the lesson. Also, sometimes it’s a convergence of  
 astrological alignments unique to you that open up energies made available to aid you in your  
 learning. Other times it’s your guide. And often times its all the above. If you’re thinking linear,  
 what you think as Deja vus could be a convergence of one or a few probabilities from your  
 current life. It’s not really from future or past. Its from converging lines of probable divergence  
 of experience you’ve had or having come together to a point of awareness.  
 

Here is a quantum concept. You can see vibration with your eyes, layers upon layers of  
 vibration. It nothing out of the ordinary. The curving of space represents gravity, the folding  
 and spin of space is the extension of energy fields. A desire causes space to fold itself. Fields  
 are multidimensional, grids are 2D fields. Fields are likened onto grids. Grids make better  
 sense to the brain than multidimensional fields intertwining like a tapestry, acting as one  
 unified field of consciousness. Gravity is a result not really a cause, but some ideas are  
 beginning to show this scientifically. What is another word for entangled? Intertwined is at the  
 core of the relationships of this connected universe. All things are intertwined, from the atoms  
 that make up your cells to your body. Aside from intertwined, its integrated. So, all of this  
 including entanglement allows energy to express in various formats. And produces patterns  
 within the fractal of interrelationships. Time is space and space moves through time.  
 Just as time moves through space. That would look like nothing  
 because humans are blind to higher frequencies. Humans can only think about it in the 2D realm. I always give  
 open-ended, that’s why is also multidimensional. When people are noticing things, like the  
 shape of a neuron being the shape of the universe, that’s what is called a dendritic formation.  
 Lightning does it too. People think Spirit carries the full extent of its dimension. You think you  
 can handle the full extent of a Universe above you? People can barely handle simple concepts  
 like this in the article. Future is about potentials, does not mean it would be set in stone,  
 people do not see the beauty in it. There is no  
 future to a history information construct. There is only potential that helps unfold the future.  
 Not even Spirit can see the future, not even God can see the future, not even the masters can  
 see. But they see potential that can be potentiated and thus spirit can push for a higher  
 potential future.  
 

People think higher energy is where chaos is, that’s just silly. Higher energy is where unity  
 and order and harmony is at. The higher planes always use pawns from lower planes. That is why higher light  
 beings do the guiding, and the dark ones use pawns. To us, those from planes above are like  
 gods compared to us, which is true. But 5th dimensional beings are still working on their  
 ascension, same for 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and so on. Angels are of 12D and higher. They are higher  
 dimensional than humans, so they shine brighter than humans, to humans they are like gods.  
 The infinite intelligence present in each particle of light is the control one in a higher plane  
 has over the lower. Higher dimensional powers with low consciousness is what is part of the darkness from all  
 comics. It creates the destructive stories that is filled with darkness. Those from planes above  
 do not go around producing mass destructive actions in the lower planes. Not unless they  
 want to get pulled into karma of lower planes and get trapped by it. Source is Source. Does  
 Source need equality? Does love need to be measured equally? People have no idea how truly  
 powerful higher plane beings are. A person's anger is literally calf skin for dinner, if people only  
 understood a small inkling of how to use their power, how does giving a child a button that  
 controls a nuclear warhead work out? Your thoughts aren’t always your own, they can make it  
 seem like it’s your idea. The transcendence from karma and graduation towards harvest into higher planes.  
 Some graduate, others who graduated may come back, some just enter to help. Everyone has  
 thousands of lifetimes to work with. Time is known in all densities.  
 

In the Hermetic sciences, you are taught all is mental. There is your magic. Understand  
 better the magic of this reality yet? It’s an illusion based on mental conditioning and belief  
 systems. That is the magic. Where is the magic? Wherever your mentality is, and belief  
 system is. And how do you know the magic is working? It’s your own illusion you asked for  
 more, so it got served. The All owes us nothing. It gave us everything. Now break out of the  
 illusion and understand the magic of reality and consciousness.  
 The All is part of you. Grasping the concept would allow  
 you to graduate to the next concept. Your existence is a concept within the creation therefore  
 you exist within the consciousness of The All. You are part of The All that is self-contained. So  
 therefore, you need to discover The All inside. If you are looking for The All outside yourself  
 and not realizing you are within The All and The All is within you, you will find nothing. And  
 thus, true death happens when you go outside the existence that is The All. Therefore, nothing  
 exists outside The All. You exist inside The All just like The All exist inside you. But when you  
 look for answers outside yourself in correlation to being inside The All. That is no existence. All  
 that exist is inside The All. Therefore, nothing exists outside The All. No light = no activity = no  
 existence = null. There is no such thing as the future version of the mighty Creative Source of The All. It pervades across all time and that is  
 a function of the creating process of consciousness. But with Creator being Creator, it just is,  
 never was, never will be. Understand that. Including the “divine” part of you.  
 Here’s an adjustment to people’s  
 learning. Your consciousness is your power, your intent is like the fuel pump allowing that  
 power polarization. Your mind sets the intent into motion with space-time and times-pace.  
 The synchronicity within spacetime leads to experience. Becoming aware of that learning is  
 via experience.  
 

Developing a skill converts that skill into mentality. And yet at the same time you need a  
 mentality flexible enough to learn more about the skill. By having a willing mentality and then  
 experiencing the path of the skill, then by observation and discovery you develop that skill  
 with mentality. And as such you become the user of it. That’s why you need the patience to  
 develop in order to observe properly and allow concepts to be absorbed. You got to love what  
 you’re doing, otherwise there is no interest and thus activation won’t happen. Love has always  
 been the answer to just about everything, love what you’re learning, and it will show you  
 concepts you have never dreamed about.  
 The part about the Hermetic all truths are but half lies, so to see the full extent of the magic is  
 to see truths and lies. Such is the nature of the creation within The All. Tools so to say. Mastery  
 over mentality eventually gets you there to nonphysical, but you’d end up in the astral form.  
 Not while you’re in the material form.  
 Manipulation and proof of magic is mental. If you so easily dance to someone else’s  
 tune, that is showing how really suggestive mental magic is.  
 That is how the magic of mentality works. The Law of One is mastery over how  
 emotions play a role in the creative force of mind. Hermetics is mastery over mentality that is  
 part of the physics of reality. Metaphysics and physics are inseparable, they are one and the  
 same. As such is the magic of law of attraction. Where spacetime fills to suit the desires of  
 mind and consciousness. That is why it is called mental magic. Hermetics works with the  
 mastery over mind first and foremost.  
 Understanding that will gain a person access to the wisdom of The All.  
 That is why the All cannot be understood by limited minds, it’s amazing and fascinating and  
 frustrating all at once.  
 That is The All.  
 That is the lord of light and lord of darkness. That is free will and that is knowledge. That is the  
 state of energy as we seek transcension.  
 

The word infinite just means all that  
 is happens to be collective consciousness. It’s just Creation in its myriad potentials. Its  
 concept within concept within concept of infinity. Purpose of harsh training is to help a  
 person strengthen the mind. The Hermetic All is mental, therefore The All is a construct  
 within the concept of All. There is always some multidimensional thing in people’s comments.  
 It can be truth, half-truth, deception, entertainment, etc. Is all at once. There is the magic.  
 The Hermetic students call the Creator, The All. Even All  
 isn't a good word for the Creator. No thing is the best term. So, nothing is the best term for  
 short. I just want to become that which is not. That is where the Creator truly is. Not a thing or  
 anything. Just pure unlimited potential. That is what nothing really is, unbounded by  
 anything.  
 

Consciousness creates light, thoughts can move beyond the speed of light, and can transcend  
 dimensional boundaries, you are light, you are a piece of consciousness or a piece of life, are  
 you not. Consciousness creates thoughts because thoughts are a manifestation of  
 consciousness.  
 According to the Hermetic Principle of Polarity, this universe is a polarized universe. Spirit is  
 beyond polarization. Light and dark are polarizations of light. The Sun is polarized, Earth is  
 polarized, all the planets, the black holes, including your consciousness, mind, your ideology,  
 and even interruptions. The Creator created matter in which case humans add part of creation  
 created material goods. This is also part of the love of the Creator, but in service of self. Some  
 consciousness has more light than others. If yours is of the dark or dim kind, you’re learning is  
 slower. Doesn’t mean it’s bad, just means you need to move at your own pace.  
 

You see no matter what you’re thinking or wanting, it’s still all written within the facet of one  
 spiritual law, its either within balance or imbalance, chaos and order, destruction and  
 creation, death and birth, etc., service of self and service of others, free will comes into play  
 when the polarity presents you choices. When you understand duality as a catalyst for the  
 exercise of free will, you’re either making choices confident or unconsciously, knowing or  
 inadvertently. Everyone is making choices, intentionally or unknowingly. It can be in thought,  
 intentions, words, whatever. You’re making choices because there’s not a moment when  
 you’re not deciding a course of action. You don’t have control over stuff outside of you. And  
 yet there’s but just one answer, such is the one law. That of love which is the unity of all. In  
 which case is the light that comes in many forms. Such is the amazing respect of frequency.  
 And the amazing power of consciousness that draws forth that light within the medium that Is  
 reality within the matrix of what we call a universe.  
 All you need to do is love. That’s the only light that is definite across all dimensions  
 and all lifetimes and all universes, that’s where the Creator is, that’s where the magic is.  
 People barely understand the intensity of what love really is, love Is the one thing that defies  
 physics and logic. People barely understand the immensity of what love really is, it’s like God  
 saying lovely, let it be known that my light allows for all things to exist. Now can you  
 understand what all actually is. Its beyond your comprehension! And yet all is what exists  
 whether known or not, seen or unseen.  
 

To use the Hermetic Laws for yourself, it is about transmuting things mentally. Your emotions,  
 your feelings, your thoughts, your state of being, how you choose is based on how you feel,  
 how you feel is based on how you choose, etc. When you feel a sudden energy drop, is because  
 you diffuse that energy and it floats away causing you to feel the loss of energy. If you feel a  
 buildup it will make you feel high energy and excited. Stillness is that state in between where  
 you can feel the pivot of that flow. Where you are gaining and losing in a balanced way. Where  
 you only see the natural flow of things instead of being affected by each polarity. You basically  
 learn to be the pivot of that movement. Through stillness and quietude. The matter of habit  
 and cultural mind complex is arbitrary. And that of your choosing. If you joyful, you have  
 attracted a more positive experience that was already available to you should you access it.  
 To understand the hermetic principles, the concept of using law against law to neutralize effects  
 of other laws, that is part of how you work within the male and female aspects of you and the  
 deep consciousness within the aspects of mental magic key to activating the magic of  
 manifestation. If you feel energetic, how about turning that energies into something useful,  
 don’t overload yourself. That’s why you practice how to be still and such. Because when you  
 energize you will be able to handle its flow. Can be dangerous if you can’t move or figure out  
 what to do with it. It’ll just get stuck. Sort of like lighting the fuse to dynamite while you’re  
 holding the dynamite. And not know what to do with it while its able to blow up in your hands.  
 See the importance of stillness and grounding? Do it wrong and you’ll create your own  
 blockages.  
 

The reason you must explore the Hermetic Principles is because these spiritual or natural laws  
 attend something static. It is within all life as well as all energy and all mind. And all that is. It  
 is extremely dynamic and is alive. It is like the difference about reading a shark and actually  
 experiencing one firsthand. Completely different aspects because reading about it is only 2D.  
 and experiencing one firsthand is a multidimensional experience. See the difference?

But then I saw, that the hardcover edition says that it is the edition from 1995 whereas the paperback is the edition from 2019. 

So now my question is whether anything has been added or any corrections have been made to the book since 1995 or if these two editions are the exact same concerning their content and their correctness.

If there was a copy of me in another part of the normal universe (our branch), it was just like me in every aspect, but ultimately made from different parts of the universe so if I die, that one would remain alive, but it's not me. 

**But in the case of many-worlds**, some parallel me's would be exact copies of  me in every aspect physically, but also made of the same parts of the universe being at 2 places at the same time, making me all of them at the same time? wouldn't it imply immortality? Sean carroll and most defenders nowadays seem to suggest that it's not like that and that the branches are completely independent, meaning that we just die in our branch and that's it, but I don't understand why it is like that, since I don't have much knowledge about quantum mechanics.

 Can someone explain me? This idea of living forever is **completely terrifying**. Consciousness being most likely just physical (as even Sean believes) and the branches being the same particles in different places at the same time, wouldn't imply we will consciously experience all those that remain conscious for eternity?

I've recently struggling about a simple problem which includes the bernoulli equation. I have just basic knowledge about hydro mechanics from my physics class, so it's possible that i misunderstood the concept of bernoulli's equation which leads to my errors. I just want to understand were do i make my mistakes in the statement. So, my concrete question is why is the hydraulic power not equal on both sides of a tube (the bigger and smaller one). In this problem is not included static pressure, the smaller and bigger side of the tube are on the same height. The hydraulic power that a pump delivers through a tube is equal P=Q(flow) *p(pressure). Since the flow is always the same on both sides, Q1=Q2, but the pressure decreases on the smaller side, p1&gt;p2, which leads that the output power flow on the smaller side is smaller P2=Q*p2, which is impossible. I understand that bernoulli's equation states that the sum of all input energy has to be equal in all points, but why does that not work with power flow? I know that the power consumption is calculated by the pressure difference as P=(p1-p2)*Q, but that still does not makes sense with my concept of understanding, so i definitely do make mistakes but i don't know were.

I went through Droste's treatment, and don't see an obvious issue with it.  Also, I'm not really noticing anything ""special"" about it -- outside of the fact that this was the first time I encountered (or at least noticed) the repulsive aspect in any treatment of the Schwarzschild solution.  Misner-Thorne-Wheeler doesn't seem to mention it.  From googling, it seems as if the idea of gravitational repulsion (as a feature of ""standard"" GR) has risen on the table only in the last couple of years.  From [this paper from 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06994.pdf), I come to the understanding that the repulsion is an observer effect -- in which case the premise of the Droste-paper, that it could be used to explain relativistic jets, is wrong (or is it -- that is, is the claim of the paper ""just"" that the observed jet speeds appear to be faster than what they really are?).

It is to my understanding that this is likely because scientific laws are much more specific than scientific theories, as well as due to the methodology used to prove the two (as in, the scientific methodology adheres to corroborating scientific laws much more appropriately than it does scientific theories, where only a facet of its implications may be confirmed).

I am a writer, and I am, for the first time, dipping my toes in the water writing a story that largely concerns time travel. I'm working on a story where my protagonist invents a time travel device and I'm trying to think of a way she could use it without creating a paradox. It's not really an idea I've played with before and I feel like I need some expert advice here!

My question is if my protagonist were to use her device to travel to a point in time preceding the dawn of mankind (i.e. the late Mesozoic era) before a mass extinction event using a portable time-travel device would she be able to travel backward and forward in time between these points (our present and the Mesozoic era) without incurring the Grandfather Paradox or the Butterfly Effect? My reasoning here is that any action my protagonist made while in the past would have little to no implication to the future timeline as the upcoming extinction event being both natural and inevitable is a fixed point that, in my estimations, effectively erases any and all action made by my protagonist.

To distinguish the two, would it not be possible to track the movement of the electron via gravity? Of course gravity is magnitudes weaker than electromagnetism which will be difficult, but maybe some smart people here can come up with a way to do it?

If this can be done, instead of having a regular detector 'looking' at which slit an electron goes through (interacting with it and collapsing the wave function), the election can be monitored more 'gently' by watching it's gravitational effect during it's path instead..",2,2020-05-26 14:24:50,physics

4646,gr2h5e,What are the mechanisms restricting physical theories to a certain number of dimensions?,"I have a few questions about, well, what the title says. 

Everyone who ever read a pop-sci article knows string theory requires a very special number of spacial dimensions to yield the results physicists desire (26 for bosonic, 9/10 for superstring/M theory), but they're never really explained much.  
Of course, string theory isn't the only theory that requires a certain number of spacial dimensions. Kaluza's unified theory of gravity and electromagnetism is a very interesting early example, needing 4 dimensions of space to include both the Einstein field equations and Maxwell's equations of electrodynamics.  
I'm sure there are many more examples of such theories (not all necessarily leading to success but nonetheless interesting to me).   
If you look deeper into the subject of strings, you might find people talking about relativistic considerations, restrictions of quantum mechanics (often related to spin) and others but it's really hard to find more information than that (at least to me, maybe I just don't know where to look).  
For Kaluza's theory, the reason for its 4-d space is the fact that you need a 5-d Riemann curvature tensor to ""fit"" the two theories in, which does make a lot of sense, but that's only one case that I can understand *kind of* enough to make a picture.  
I would be very thankful if someone could explain at least some of the limitations to me (or point me to a resource that does).

4667,gqujy3,How to calculate dynamic gravitational force.,"So I was thinking that about a problem one of my friends showed me a while back concerning a rocket going up through the atmosphere and it required using the force of gravity to calculate its acceleration in order to find the maximum height, and I noticed that a lot of basic physics assume gravitational acceleration to be uniform with respect to distance. I know that the change would probably be negligible in real world scenarios, but I'd like to know how one would go about calculating this changing force and applying to calculating the motion.

&amp;#x200B;

So my first thought was to take the derivative of the equation that gives gravitational force between two objects at a distance with respect to the radius Fg=(GmM)/r^(2) and I got F'g(r) = (-2GmM)/r^(3) . I was thinking that you could take Fg=ma and substitute a with d/t^(2) and then substitute d with r to get Fg = m\*(r/t^(2)) and was wondering where to go from here. 

&amp;#x200B;

I could take the derivative with respect to either radius, like i did in the earlier equation, or with respect to time. Or can I make Fg a function of both and find the directional derivative, but in that case how would I get the unit normal of distance and time? I was also thinking that I could make 'r' a function of time, since r is changing with time, but then 'r' is also affecting time and vice versa since how 'r's change affects how the force of gravity changes thus affecting how much time the rocket is in the air and how much time the rocket is in the air is affecting how r changes. Could that be patched by waiting until after I take derivatives with respect to radius to make radius a function of time in order to find. If we're gonna bring directional derivatives can we go ahead and bring gravitational fields and their flux into the equation? That sounds like it'd make the whole affair messy though.

&amp;#x200B;

The goal here is to find 'd' in the equation vf^(2) = vi^(2) \+ 2ad with consideration in how a is changing over time in order to find d with the assumption vf is 0 and vi is given, but in this case 'a' would have to be negative unless your coordinate system is based in Australia.

Basically water below the surface is surrounded on all sides by water, while water at the surface is surrounded only by water below it. Water is polar so it creates hydrogen bonds with itself, and this cohesive force pulls on other water molecules. The water molecules below the surface have a net force of zero acting on them because they are pulled in every direction, while the water at the surface has a downward force acting on it, so it compresses until the pressure of water below stops it. Great, but I still don't get how this results in surface tension.

For surfactants, I understand that the amphipathic molecules orient so the polar end is in the polar water and the nonpolar end is in the air, but I don't see why this would reduce surface tension.

Also, if anyone could explain why fluid flow occurs when there's a surface tension difference, that would be helpful. Thanks.",3,2020-05-26 00:08:35,physics

if the universe does indeed have one universal wavefunction, which isn't collapsing, could it be it actually is perhaps *slowly collapsing* and the *rate of the collapse of the wavefunction* is entropy which is slowly increasing, and the waveform can only collapse once formed?   


also the universal wave function can be seen as the addition of all the wave functions of all the interacting bodies in the universe, perhaps?

&amp;#x200B;

An  electron (m= 9x10\^-31) goes from point A to B in an electric field. Its  speed went from 416m/s to 111m/s . The variation of the speed is due to  the work of the electric force of the field. Find the voltage  (electrical tension) between point A and point B.

All the formulas I know need the distance between point A and B to find the voltage, here, the distance is not given.

I am interested in a few different disciplines, but I feel there is a lack of genuine interests in physics amongst my friends. Therefore, I wanna see if there is anyone in this community who would like to be my friends in my physics journey!

So a little bit about my physics background; I am going to university this fall but I have completed high school physics courses that are first year equivalent (I have done both IB Physics HL and AP Physics Cs). So I guess you can treat me as a student who just finished his first yr in undergrad. I have been exposed to a full range of topics in physics, from Newtonian to some of the basis of Quantum Mechanics and Theories of Relativity. I also know some engineering physics as well so you can also express your thoughts on that.

Currently, I have finished some Lagrangian and Hamiltonian (but really on the surface level) on my own. And I am planning to do a rather ""focused"" study on String Theory (not to understand everything like a grad student, but I just wanna get a feeling for what the mathematics is like and try my best to understand some concepts).

Aside from that, if you also feel a bit bored or lonely during quarantine, perhaps we can also talk about our lives or just about everything; since we have physics as a common ground, I can see we will have endless discussions. Or perhaps, we can be life-long friends, cuz who knows right? Remember it is always in a state of possible and impossible at the same time? Haha

I also learned that the reason that we don't have a unified theory for physics is because gravity is not compatible with both theories (quantum and standard model physics) ? To me it feels like the concept of an event horizon and a singularity is an undiscoverable answer much like the idea of one god who we can never discover ?

i just think it is strange and almost feel that perhaps people are being misled by wealthy religious organisations that have always hated science while also supporting a similar ideology to monotheism ?

I would suggest that anything that is currently accepted as the existence of black holes or gravity are in fact the result of identifying the centre of mass whether that be a single object like a planet or a group of objects like a galaxy, or in regards to aerodynamics the displacement of gas by mass and energy resulting in lift. 

obviously gravity is a theory and im not sure how often it is ever used even when designing planes or rockets and is probably more for those interested in theoretical physics but i thought perhaps i had origins from religious people who also dabbled in theoretical physics ?",1,2020-05-25 02:30:36,physics

I'm copying over from r/AskPhysics since it doesn't look like crossposting is a feature of this subreddit, and I wasn't able to find an answer over there ([https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/gphz35/analytical\_continuation\_on\_matsubara\_axis](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/gphz35/analytical_continuation_on_matsubara_axis/)/) . Anyways, I'm hoping to reach a wider audience here and find an answer, so here goes:

As I've been reading up on the analytical continuation scheme known as maximum entropy, I had what I think might be a basic question that's been bothering me from the outset

So I know that in either imaginary time- or frequency-space, you can represent the Green's function G as some integral over a kernal K times the spectral function A =(-1/π)Im\[G\]. I.e.

G(iωn)=int\[K(iωn,ω)A(ω)dω\] or G(τ)=int\[K(τ,ω)A(ω)dω\]

where

K(iωn,ω) = 1/(iωn-ω) or K(τ,ω)=Exp\[-ωτ\]/(1+Exp\[-βω\])

and iωn/ω are the imaginary/real frequencies and τ is imaginary time. These expressions can be obtained by just looking at the Matsubara Green's function's Lehmann representation and Fourier transforming with some Matsubara sums and Fermi distribution weight functions, but they're stated in the introduction of Jarrell's lecture notes from Forschungszentrum 2012: [https://www.cond-mat.de/events/correl12/manuscripts/jarrell.pdf](https://www.cond-mat.de/events/correl12/manuscripts/jarrell.pdf)

Now I also know that the inverse problem, which is often presented as A(ω)=(K(τ,ω)\^-1)G(τ) if im using some makeshift operator notation, is ill-defined because of the exponential suppression of K (or rather, its determinant) at large frequencies

But I think a very basic question would be the following: why do we not just use the first Matsubara axis definition above to define our analytical continuation problem? Why go through the trouble to devise a method such as maximum entropy and find the most probable spectral function given an imaginary time Green's function? The exponential term is introduced by the fourier transform, right? Why not do the analytical continuation before fourier transforming and work with a well-behaved inverse kernel like (iωn-ω)?

4760,gpw74r,HEP Theory Reading Club (UF),"Hi All,

I am a graduate student in the University of Florida. Several of our students in HEP theory have established a reading club, and we are glad to invite you all.

The goal of our reading club is to read and review the content and the logic of theoretical physics textbooks. Currently, we are reading the *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by Schwartz M.D. (As we progress, the material to cover will be more advanced.)

Our current members have already taken 4-5 semesters of QFT. The fact is, in class and homework the professors have no choice but to focus on the calculation more than the logic. However, when you read through any textbook, there are always some logic chains that are well or ill addressed, but cannot be explained in classes. This is the point we want to cover in the reading club.

The official NASA recording, recorded by Fred Scarf, using Voyager 2's plasma wave subsystem, a 16 channel step frequency receiver. 

You can hear that it sounds... well, interesting, but kind of harsh and shitty. 

[https://youtu.be/5j5IObIReqk](https://youtu.be/5j5IObIReqk)

The version which most people know, however, sounds a lot more lush, and musical. That's this version, taken from a 90's CD of 'sounds of the planets,' which claims to have sourced the sounds from NASA: 

[https://youtu.be/UChzxK9gknM](https://youtu.be/UChzxK9gknM)

What is the relation between these two sound worlds? They are very different. 

The plasma scientist in charge of the measurements, Fred Scarf, had the 16 channel signal being run into a synthesiser back on Earth. He was converting the frequencies into some kind of music. He would perform this at certain press events to much amazement. 

The editor of *Science* wrote glowingly about one of these press conferences: 

*""Scarf creates “the sounds of space,” an eerie symphony of hisses, pops, and whistles.* \[...\] *His team played their data, which were divided into 16 frequency channels, through a 16-channel music synthesizer. The fragment of music that results is fitting accompaniment to Voyager's journey past Saturn. Slowly, dreamily, the midlevel brasses surge and ebb against a deep roll of basses and a high, floating treble. The music lasts for only a minute. But it haunts the mind.*

This description doesn't sound like either of the recordings. 

Perhaps this 'music' is what we hear on the first recording, those 'hisses, pops and whistles.' Perhaps the music made by Scarf has never been released. Perhaps it has been adapted into the more dreamy, ethereal 'Sound of Jupiter' that people listen to on YouTube.

After weeks and weeks of mistakes and dead ends, I just couldn't figure it out. I started to doubt myself, maybe I just wasn't smart enough, maybe I actually was a fraud. I was close to giving up. 
Then my bike got stolen. Instead of cycling into campus, I had to spend 40 minutes walking. The next day, on the walk home, I cracked it. I remember it like it was yesterday, standing on the pavement, frantically typing the solution onto my phone, in a minor panic that I'd lose the answer.

1. I was a stupid 11 year old kid with OCD and touched a half pulled out outlet plug with separate hands on each prong which should of created a circuit across my heart and killed me. 
2. Just got my licenses and almost got tboned at 50 miles an hour. If I either slowed down or sped up a few seconds before that I would be dead.

After reflecting on these two incidents I decided it was worth to do some further research on quantum immortality. Now I am not a physicist or even good in my high school honors physics class but Quantum Immortality seems to make a lot of sense to me if the MWI holds true. Obviously this has caused me great anguish as I now have to face living for an eternity.  This has led me to experience great anxiety and Depersonalization. Any advice will be appreciated.

The goal is to preserve the ice as long as possible. While I’m sure the results will be similar, which of the 2 scenarios is better?

On one hand, I think scenario 1 is better because if utilizes the insulation properties of the hydroflask, and since the temperature in the fridge is only a few degrees above freezing, there’s hardly any heat coming in.

On the other hand, I think scenario 2 is better because the “coldness” inside the hydroflask is maintained by the fridge, rather than the ice. This means that the ice wouldn’t melt as quickly because it’s being assisted by the fridge to keep the water cold.

Let's say we plucked the string in a way that it waves around 440 hz. The 2D people bow can see the oscillation of the point. Also, lets assume string itself does not interact with the paper, it just passes through without any friction. This would let 2D people believe as long as they don't touch the dot, the dot will always oscillates in 440 hz.

On top of that, let's say we let the string move and unless there is a friction (from any 2D object in 2D paper plane), it just moves with the initial speed it has. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume the direction of the string falls is perpendicular to the plane that string is waving. What 2D people would see something oscillating and moves at some constant speed when left alone.

Lets bend the paper. Imagine how 2D people would see the dot moving now. Even though the speed the string falls is not changed, relative to the 2D people, this intersection changes its moving speed as the bend goes, while also maintaining the same 440hz oscilation.

However, as 2D people grab the string its movement stops, now it is a straight line and all of its momentum is transferred to the 2D paper, to the thing it got grabbed by. As one stops a guitar string with its fingers.

The topics we had covered up to that point were: motion along a straight line, vectors, motion in two and three dimensions, forces and motion, kinetic energy and work, and potential energy and conservation of energy.  


The exam consisted almost entirely of derivations - writing proofs of formulas (e.g., the equation for the range of a projectile) which the majority of us did not expect and were not prepared for, as the only assignments we had been given throughout the semester were computational problems from the textbook, given through WileyPlus, which primarily tested our problem-solving abilities (see imgur album). When pressed regarding the nature of the exam the professor claimed in class it would be 50% or more on projectile motion. The only other information we were given was an email sent the evening before the exam that no calculators would be allowed which could have meant anything – be it proofs of formulas or replacing numerical values for variables in a typical physics problem.


Several people in our class of 37 students scored as low as 5-10%. The exam (worth 20% of our overall grades) will not be dropped and may not even be curved anymore. During our last lecture before the final, someone asked if he is still curving the first midterm and the professor said “I don’t know.” Some classmates and I do not think a curve is even enough since in our opinion, the exam was unfair in the first place.


In addition to other issues we have with the course, we emailed the chair of the physics department and his response in regards to the first midterm being unfair is:

&gt;The midterm examination is typical and appropriate.  Physics students must get used to   doing analysis using symbols only, the earlier the better.  Algebraic analysis using symbols is not necessarily deriving formulas.    Conducting analysis by manipulating symbols, rather than numbers, is a common and preferred approach in physics because the outcome is more general and provides more insights into the physical pictures, symmetry, and extrapolations, etc. As you get into upper level physics courses, you may not see a single numerical solution in a whole semester. You may practice when doing your homework by not inserting numbers into formulas and express the answer using symbols and inserting the number in the very end.

I think the department chair misunderstood us as having an issue with having almost no numerical problems on the exam which is NOT what we have an issue with. We did have WileyPlus homework problems that only use variables but none of these problems required writing proofs.


Our second midterm was completely different, an open-book exam consisting mainly of numerical computational problems from the textbook with the values changed, and a few true/false questions. The final was 40 true/false conceptual questions.


**TL; DR**: I think my first midterm for calculus-based Physics 1 was unfair, but maybe I am wrong. Do you think this is a typical and appropriate first midterm exam for calculus-based Physics 1? The only prerequisite of the course is Calculus 1.The only assignments we had that could give us a clue on what the exam would be like were computational problems given on WileyPlus that are from Halliday’s *Fundamentals of Physics*. The professor notified us the evening before the exam “no calculators allowed.”

There are some brilliant history-of-discovery material out there (videos, pop-sci books) that are introductory and for the general audience. But I wish there was a way to optionally learn/re-learn the actual physics (not just pop-sci and intros) linearly as it was progressing through time: from Kepler, to Maxwell, Shrodinger etc, along with all the observations and experiments that were being made, in detail, as well as the state of mathematics at their times, as needed.

For example, when you're learning Maxwell's equations, you learn what experiments led to them, with what was known in physics at the time, and what mathematics was available to Maxwell then. At this stage of your learning, you don't ""know"" more than he did; so you're discovering and solving with him, in a way.

I'm currently taking a MS in Computer Science and now need to do my thesis. I really love astro physics as well and I am hoping to work on a related field some time in the near future.  


Ever since I was a kid, (even though we family is not that well off), I was very enthusiastic about science. Chemistry and Physics in particular. I had to take CS in college well because I was discourage to take Physics or Chem because they said there's no money on it :( Don't get me wrong, I really love CS as well.  


Now I am looking for possible research topics for my thesis and I humbly ask for your help. I've read some amazing and cool astronomy and physics papers and I want to try doing a research by applying CS on these fields. I think I would say I have an average understanding of most terms in astronomy and physics, but TBH, I still know (and feel) that I have very little knowledge to be able to create a good research topic.  


So, if anyone of you would like to help small guy like me, I would really appreciate it! I fee like I don't have the confidence to decide if its a good topic or not on my own. Any kind of idea or some possible source of idea would go a long way (I'll give credit of course, for any kind of help).

I am turning to you because I need some genuine physics advice/explanations on the new and trending adventure called ""Randonauting."" A couple of my friends have started doing it-- I am not sure if I am allowed to link the website on here, but basically the websites claim all of these physics terms, I think the word ""quantum"" was used about 300 times, and to me it seemed out of place... but I am new to physics (1st year of college physics courses completed) so I am not sure if maybe I just don't understand it. 

Essentially you set an intention for your journey, such as ""happiness, closure, fear, etc."" and you receive a number from a ""quantum number generator"" or something of the sort, and it shoots you back a completely random location near you based on 3 location types: ""attractor points"" which have a high number of quantum points, ""voids"" which are locations that have the least quantum points, and ""anomalies"" so locations with the strongest of either so either a strong void or attractor. People experience seeing weird coincidences when they go to these places and they claim there is a physics based reasoning behind them.... I personally don't see it, but again I might just be a skeptic. 

My question to you is-- is there any real physics behind this concept or is it just gibberish? What are your thoughts? Please feel free to share your opinion no matter what it is as I have scoured the internet trying to find a physics-based understanding / concept behind what I believe is mostly gibberish (lol).",6,2020-05-20 07:31:21,physics

It is hanged on a wall using screws at the top of the cupboard. I am trying to understand what force must a screw withstand to keep the cupboard on the wall.

To keep it simple I started by trying to understand what horizontal force would be applied to a single screw by an ""L"" bracket. Here it is explained so I was able to calculate it ([https://youtu.be/kkgj5QBF\_Tc](https://youtu.be/kkgj5QBF_Tc)).

My example:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bkdf0jczsvz41.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58581c200600207609b0e33de6bb00afb2cb43f7

On a simple diagram above, imagine the pink coloured part is an L bracket and there is a Load1 placed at the top. The screw (considering only 1 screw to keep it simple) is also at the edge of the L bracket. Then I calculated the force F which a screw must withstand to hold the bracket, when Load1 = 40kg (392N) is:

F = (392N) x (39cm) / (80cm)

F = 191 N

So this would mean the screw must hold 191N .

If this calculation is correct (based on the yotube video where it is explained), then I got it. But then the question is, how would I calculate the force F on the screw if I add another 2 shelves on the L bracket above (green ones) and put also some Load2 and Load3 on it. This is not clear to me. Would the equation above also work with a condition I will sum Load1+Load2+Load3 there?",0,2020-05-20 03:44:39,physics

Question 1, can gravity effect the speed that light moves ? 

Question 2, if light is pulled towards something like a black hole, does it’s speed increase as it gets pulled towards it , then decrease as it pulls away ? 

Question 3, the question that hurts my head, if question 2 is correct, does this mean if you set up two light sources , in opposite directions, pointing at sensors exactly the same distance apart but one had a black hole in between the light source and sensor ( close enough to have an effect on the light, not close enough to swallow it) would the light take the same time to travel to the sensor on both paths? 

Light - - - - - - sensor 
Light - - O - - -sensor 

If that is all true does that mean even when the speed of light changes, it always takes the same amount of time to get from A to B ? If all of this is wrong and the speed light goes from A to B can be different, could the estimates about the universes ages / size be totally off ? 

Bonus question, can light be slowed down to the point it doesn’t move?, if yes, can it be sped up again?

5027,gn17iw,The physics of a very massive particle homunculus?,"Radical Panpsychism is the theory that there is an homuculus in the brain and it is a high mass particle or quantum coherent molecule. The particle is conscious with free will, can think and dream and also see and hear and send/receive other qualia using electromagnetism. Particles are conscious but free will is evident only in very high mass particles and that the particles inherited their abilities from the intelligent conscious universe.

The brain communicates with the particle homunculus using the microtubules of neurons as antennas to send/receive the electromagnetic homuncular code from the particle homunculus. The coded streams of photons send sounds, images, ideas, emotions and other qualia between a brain and a homunculus or between two high mass particles.

If the electromagnetic homuncular code is decoded, it would be very easy to give sight to the blind or hearing to the deaf. All you need is a camera and/or microphone, a chip that converts the image/sounds to the electromagnetic homuncular code, and a maser to send the code to the particle homunculus mounted on eyeglasses -- no brain surgery required! This is also enables awesome virtual reality.

Also the breaking of the electromagnetic homuncular code would allow a new industry to be born, the artificial body industry! It will probably become the biggest industry of all and because of mass production available to all! The particle homunculus could simply be transferred to the artificial body, the body powered up and the particle homunculus will receive all the senses and control the body with its free will! I think eventually artificial bodies will be better than real bodies and since particles can last billions of years so could people in increasingly better succession of artificial bodies!

Artificial bodies can be optimized for Mars or the vacuum of space or any other environments! Artificial bodies optimized for space could allow construction workers in space to build huge spaceships with much precision and few safety concerns!",5,2020-05-19 19:44:08,physics

I just want the concepts explained to me in a matter that I can wrap my head around, which sometimes seems hard for me espeacially when it comes to time and space, time dialation, the double-slit experiment, but I'm just so fascinated by it all.

Where should I start? Would be nice but not necessary if the book was translated to german, since the topics are hard enough to understand in your native language I guess.

If you can read through this mumbo jumbo, decipher it, and come up with some experiments that can recreate the effects that are being proposed here, I will throw money at you. Not insane amounts of money, I am a working dude with a day job. However, I am tired of seeing all these papers come out and have the military dropping hints left right and center it has a way to use this tech to more efficiently murder their enemies, and civilian space travel is getting none of it. If this is fake, I want to test it, video tape the tests and debunk these papers once and for all. If it's real, it shouldn't only be in the hands of people who murder other people as their dayjob. &gt;:(

P.S. I am going to start with the offer of $500. I will require videos of the experiments, and I want to see a bill of what was bought with the money, but if you can get proof of this working for under $500, you can spend it on hookers and blow for all I care. If you have interesting results, and other ideas you want to test, I might be willing to sponsor more. 

PPS. If anyone wants to step up and match me, so we can get good lab equipment, I would be more than happy. I only ask that you don't rush in. I will announce who I have chosen to fund, and you are free to make your own funding choices. Fund the idea, not the specific people, if we can have 2-3 seperate teams working independent from each other, but open to the other people's research, so much the better. 

PPPS. If this blows up and we discover revolutionary tech, the profits should be split equally among everybody involved. I might be the one throwing money at the problem, but that doesn't mean it only belongs to me. Everyone should have a piece of the pie.

Here comes the question, is this energy of atom fusion, the energy we see and feel? I mean like the sun heat, even the light, photons? Because I read somewhere on the Internet that positron and electron annihilate which cause energy release and forming photons. Or is the heat  released during the fusion and photons are formed in the annihilation process? So what is the real ""photon factory""? Do photons transmit the heat as well? Thanks for your replies.

Now I was wondering have there been any research on new mediums to transfer information, like using the dark energy, the dark matter, or sub atomic particles and the interactions taking place at that level, something like quantum polarity, or qubit states or quantum states? simply because in the fields of quantum physics it is said that the distance of the two particles is not important to designate the state of the other particle, at two ends of the universe.

""The force, **F**, is resisted by the static friction at the point of contact of the wheel and the ground or other surface. This resistance causes the wheel to roll forward.""

But I don't have a good intuition for why this causes the wheel to roll forward. It seems like at the pivot point, the forces are balanced (friction from ground and tire spoke ""hitting"" the ground) and so the wheel shouldn't move yet there is a torque applied to the wheel so the wheel ""has"" to move which where I am confused.

Never did and REU, and one semester I was supposed to do an astronomy research project with one other student and a professor, but the professor wasn't very on top of it and the whole thing fell apart, anyway, those details aren't important.

The important part is, is there the equivalent of an REU that I can do now, even though I've already graduated? I've been looking into a lot of internships and stuff, and of course everything is closed because of the stupid pandemic, but it seems everything is either only for continuing physics students or they require previous research experience. I really want to do computational physics, especially, but I have no experience programming outside of the stuff I've done in classes.

How do I get experience when I don't have any experience????

So much so that at times I even considered switching to physics. In the end, I chose pure mathematics primarily because of its truly immense and unequaled beauty (no offense). Anyways, I have met some mathematicians who were indeed snobbish intellectually, with a sense of superiority over physicists, engineers etc, let alone everybody else. But it is most certainly not the rule: far from it. I have also noticed that physicists can be quite arrogant too. Ours is the most fundamental science and so forth. Now, most of the physicists that I got to know in my 20-something years were, so to speak, very intimately connected to mathematics: they had either taken part in math competitions once upon a time, or have switched to physics after an undergraduate degree in mathematics, or were mathematical physicists and so forth. Needless to say, they nearly unanimously admired mathematics just as much as physics. Yet it is not a particularly large, nor diverse sample. And so I decided to take the risk of raising that question here, while stressing that is not my intention to stir any controversy or debate about whose work is more noble, important, fundamental, intellectually demanding, whatever: what do physicists in general think of mathematics and mathematicians?

The [Aharonov-Bohm effect](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.115.485) is usually cited to demonstrate that the potential is physical in a quantum theory. Sixty years ago they proposed two experiments, a magnetic AB effect that was observed soon after its proposal, and an electric AB effect that has never been observed (Nature did publish a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/35808) with a perhaps confusing title that suggests that they observed an electric AB effect, but they in fact saw a related but different effect that appears more like the AC Josephson effect).

It is important to establish that both the electric and the magnetic potentials are physical. To that end in our paper we proposed a simple superconductor quantum interference experiment that would test the electric AB effect.",128,2020-05-16 14:53:20,physics

5226,gklybj,Physicist VS Astrophysicist VS Aerospace Engineer,"I'm 16 now and am trying to narrow down my degree options, and I've come down to these 3. 

As far as just interest goes I love all 3, but Astrophysics is my favorite for sure. It's my true passion in a way that nothing else quite is, while the other subjects fall slightly behind. I have a perceived pros and cons list below of the degrees, but if you wanted to go ahead and answer without reading that then that is fine. Thanks.

As far as I can tell the main pros and cons of the 3 degrees (for me at least) are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. A physics degree is very versatile and the knowledge learned can be applied to many different related disciplines within science. If you get a physics degree, you can work in quantum mechanics, astrophysics, particle physics, etc.
2. The con of physics is that you seem to need a Ph.D. to get a research position or for getting related jobs in general.

&amp;#x200B;

1. The main pro of an astrophysics degree is that it's my main passion. I love physics and aerospace engineering, but at the end of the day, nothing is my passion in quite the same way astrophysics (or astronomy) is. If I could go out of my degree with expertise in this field that would be fantastic. 
2. The con of this seems to be: you need a Ph.D., you may end up liking another field of physics more, there may be more computer science than preferable involved, and job opportunities are better among physicists. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. This seems to be the only 1 out of the 3 degrees in which bachelors may be enough to be readily considered for jobs/research. 
2. I know there would be a lot of general physics, chemistry, and math involved, but a lot of that is applied to how to build/use things instead of more general, and this isn't preferable for me personally.

Frankly, I'm not sure yet if I could like to get a Ph.D or not, this stands up to question. Thanks.",5,2020-05-15 20:27:09,physics

Hi, I'm an interested layperson, more or less, and I enjoy reading about and trying to understand physics. To give you an idea of where I'm at, I have an undergraduate degree in chemistry, so I'm not scientifically literate, but I know I lack a lot of the mathematical tools necessary to fully understanding this. Lately I've been reading about PQ Symmetry-Breaking and how the theorized field predicts the existence of the axion, which is apparently a pseudoscalar. 
Now I understand this stuff at a very basic level, and it's hard to find any material on this that's kind of on my level, but I'll try to outline what I think I understand as briefly as I can, and maybe one of you kind people will have time to enlighten me. 

So here is what I think I understand:
It's kind of odd that strong interactions preserve CP Symmetry, so P&amp;Q proposed that there is the potential to violate symmetry, but the term that describes that symmetry violation is basically zero, and there is some mechanism which would result in that term ending up at zero in a more or less natural way instead of by fine tuning (that is to say there is a reason for it to be zero and it's not just that it happens to be), and that mechanism is an interaction with another field having particular properties (that I won't pretend to understand), described that field is basically the axion, which is a pseudoscalar.

I think I understand what a scalar field is... I assume it's a field that has a single value at any given point - something like a heatmap of temperature - versus a vector field which has a magnitude and a direction component at any given point.

I have read that a pseudoscalar is like a scalar except that it changes sign under parity transformation, which is a change in sign of a spatial coordinate. And this is where something isn't clicking for me. At some coordinate (x, y, z) the field has some value, but if you chose to redefine your coordinate system or rotate your perspective such that the same physical position was now called (-x, - y, - z), then the value at that position would be the inverse of what it was before?

I don't know if they will be able to answer this for me, if this is the appropriate reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that I tried to make a ""doctor chihiros"" that is supposed to be a device that by electrolysis would help inhibit algae in an aquarium.

I made a ""diy"" version of hundreds of videos on youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

It is very simple: two stainless steel metal networks are used facing each other, without touching each other, and they are each connected to a pole (positive or negative) of a transformer. This generates a lot of visible small particles.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in the middle of the network, red particles began to be generated, with just a few minutes of use ... as if it were rust (for now ""stainless steel"" is not seen to be rusty ... if this is possible, but these particles are seen, which are then pushed by the same bubbles into all the water in the aquarium).

&amp;#x200B;

Rust is not good in an aquarium, it can kill fish, etc. So I would like to be sure of what is happening here.

Aquarium water is tap drinking water, which I also add calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate to to increase the hardness of the water (which is what my fish need).

&amp;#x200B;

I saw that this red is generated to several (in YouTube videos), although not many show it in the video where they teach you how to do it. What can this be red? Can I make this same device for electrolysis with two aluminum nets? If so, what kind of reaction could happen in the water? Would you change something to be aluminum?

5318,gje3ny,[Advice] Installation of wood stove and air insulation,"I need to upgrade the pipe of the stove with one that has a higher thermal conductivity and thus radiates more heat to my house. The question is: Can I keep the outer pipe so that is less of a job to do the installation (Alternative ""A"") or should I remove it because the heat radiation won't be as much (Alternative ""B"").

Consider that the air that gets trapped in between both pipes does not circulate and it will be ""stuck"" absorbing the heat. Will this air dampen the desired effect of heating my home or with a given time both alternatives would be the same?

I am wondering what the correct answer is because I can see both sides due to the question’s horrible phrasing. 

So far, this is my understanding (correct me if I’m wrong because I may be ignorant to physics-related subjects as I have not taken any classes in it): 

The more mass an object has, the more gravity would act upon it to make it “heavy”. It’s one of the two factors that affect gravity (mass and distance). Also, mass affects an object’s inertia, or the ability of the object to resist any change in motion. Basically, the more matter there is in an object, the harder it will be to move. Think of it like a domino effect: the mass of an object affects the weight of an object (W/F = m x g), and that affects how easy it is for you to lift. Weight is kind of like an effect of “mass” if that makes sense. However, due to the question’s phrasing, I also believe it could be weight because the object’s weight is what tells you how much gravity is impacting the object. So couldn’t you be talking about the object’s weight? For example, a brick is so much easier to lift on the moon than on the Earth due to it’s weight differences. 

ONCE AGAIN, please do correct me if I am wrong anywhere! I will admit I am not that knowledgeable on this matter.",8,2020-05-13 16:37:53,physics

The next consecutive tutorials will build on each other. Each scientific or data scientific analysis requires one first step: data preparation. We obtain comet data from the Minor Planet Center and create a simple SQLite database. This database is the fundament for the next tutorials where we will make a scientific deep dive.

Besides the Python part I am thinking to write something like *Space Science in a Nutshell* articles where I would like to cover a several Solar System topics as a public outreach work. There are a lot of great articles and series on astronomy (galaxies, black holes, dark matter, ... the cool stuff), but I did not find anything that is related to our very cosmic neighbourhood. What do you thing? Please let me know. It would be more for the general public, so the experts would be bored. But in the last couple of weeks I realised that I really enjoy writing tutorials. During my research career I did a lot of public outreach presentations, guides and so on and would like to continue it at least virtually.

Same thing applies also for great astronomy software and tools like NASA HORIZONS, heavens above, and others. I think a lot of people would like to have a collection or compilation of nice astronomy software.

I hope I am not overshooting things and really hope for your feedback.

5370,giikom,Why do so many people believe that we are living in a Simulation? And why is no one bringing up these arguments?,"So I stumbled upon the Simulation Argument/Hypothesis/Theory just some time ago. Although I have heard of it quite some time ago, I never considered it... until now. I have seen so many people believe we are living in a simulation. That being said, I see a lot of issues that no one is bringing up so I would like to.

One argument I have seen used to justify the argument are our mathematical laws of physics and how they work so well. What doesn’t make sense is how can this be valid if the civilization that build the computer would also need these laws or else it wouldn’t be possible. Think about it, you need the original laws of physics to come from somewhere that’s not a simulation. So I don’t see this being plausible because the base reality one will still need laws of physics from a non-computer source. Why can’t that be us.

Second, Adding to that argument, I don’t understand where the people simulating us originally come from. The laws of physics to make intelligent life and computer possible at the same time need to be congruent, thus, asking how is this possible. 

Third, Bekensteins limit also doesn’t make it possible is what I have heard although I’m not exactly familiar with it. Another limit is Moore’s law as progress will begin dwindling as we continue progressing.

Fourth, how are we able to perceive feelings and happiness in the sense of actual feelings and not just statistics. Is it possible to make an AI happy. I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking scientists.

So my question is why are so many very intelligent scientists such as Neil DeGrasse and Elon Musk believing and promoting this theory. Even Musk stated that base reality is 1/billion. I have also seen overwhelming support from the public regarding this theory. To me, this theory sounds like the Divine theory in which it’s like, how created that and then how created that etc. People have also claimed that paranormal events are the result of computer we live in. I would like to hear your thoughts. My main argument is that their laws of physics would have to be the same here so that computers and life can be possible. In that case, we can model our world to see if it’s possible which I have heard it isn’t. I have been having almost an existential crisis about this and that my life is a lie. So maybe you can all help me debunk this theory of possible. Thank you. Want to hear your responses, thank you once more.",23,2020-05-12 14:35:06,physics

I  have a humidifier that I run for 8 hours overnight in the bedroom.  Once a day I add 64oz of water.

The bedroom is pretty large - 11' x 14' x 8'.  That's 1232 cu ft.   I looked up on engineering site: 

at 68F the air can carry 1.07 (*10-3* *lb/ft3*)    So 1232 cu ft.  Is carrying 1.318 lbs of water at 100%. 

Let's  say the humidity in the atmosphere is 60% at that temperature.   So I  am figuring there is .79lbs (.60 x 1.318lbs ) of water in the air in the room without the humidifier running.  

If  I add 64oz of water, at the end of 8 hours in the morning, that's adding 4lbs of water into the sealed (really just a closed door) room.   Doesn't that push the water content way over the 1.318 lb at 100%?   I don't see moisture on the carpet, nor does the room feel particularly humid.  

My first question was how much would 64oz of water raise the existing humidity.  But then I see that adding 64oz actually raises it over 100% humidity so I don't think I am calculating this correctly.  What am I missing?",3,2020-05-12 10:01:54,physics

On the right, you have dynamically generated plots for the kinematic of the particles. You can see in the video that we can switch the frame of reference on a particle rather than the origin of the world. The plot are then updated accordingly.

To keep things simple we assume that the reflectors, absorber, emitter are 100% efficient.

The idea is that the device is filled with photons at start. The torque can be cancelled by having two devices attached to each other having contra-rotating photon loops.

To start moving emission is stopped. Photon momentum is transferred to the device.

To stop moving emission is continued, transferring momentum to photons.

So my thought is that any acceleration is counteracted by the the recoil from the reflectors becoming asymmetric, as they start moving relative to the photons. Is that about right?

In principle I understand that adding an external magnetic field splits the energy levels and therefore splits the emission lines.

But is this a continuous process? Or would the magnetic field cause the electrons to line up, and the line splitting would cease, so you'd only see the splitting for a moment?

Why does a photon have the energy of the transition + the jump from the magnetic alignment?

Wouldn't the photon emitted just have the energy of the electron aligning with the field?

Does the process happen like:  Magnetic field on, electron aligns and drops in energy level, emitting a slightly higher energy photon?  And sometimes the electron aligns first, before transitioning, giving the energy of photon that would normally be given in absence of magnetic field?

When a camera takes a photo of a laptop/ipad/monitor/etc., fringes appear. I found out that it happens due to the difference of refresh rate and shutter speed. Does this mean the higher refresh rates cause more fringes?
For example, if the same camera takes a picture of a screen at 30fps and 60fps, will the 60fps refresh rate screen have more fringes because of its faster rate? If not, why?

After my undergrad, I’m hoping to go into a quantum information/computing sort of area but still not entirely set. As such I’ve tailored most of my module choices towards this, but I’m left with one or two more module gaps to fill in. 

Although I am very certain I won’t be going into theoretical physics, I am interested in taking quantum field theory and general relativity for my final 2 choices.

1. Taking these courses might not directly benefit me as much as taking a more relevant module such as plasmonics &amp; metamaterials or nanotechnology

2. Future supervisors may question why I took these if I’m not interested in doing theoretical physics

3. Simply having an interest in these might not justify the amount of effort required to overcome their difficulty

5490,gh0t7z,Notes on String Theory and Quantum Gravity (Feedback),"Hello everyone,

This is my first post on Reddit, so please be gentle. I noticed a recent post on string theory, and I was inspired to see so many engaged comments and general expression of interest in this area of mathematical physics. 

I'm not sure if it is appropriate, but I recently started a research blog in string theory / quantum gravity. As I have Asperger's, communication doesn't come easy when trying to write for others. I do not write in such a generally popular and accessible way as the post linked in the thread \[ [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/ggd3t4/i\_wrote\_a\_blog\_post\_on\_finding\_gravity\_lurking\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/ggd3t4/i_wrote_a_blog_post_on_finding_gravity_lurking_in/) \], but I am trying to be accessible without losing any of the maths or important technical details.

 When it comes to string theory in general, I've started developing a series of posts that help guide the reader through Polchinski's textbooks (these are, in my opinion, the authoritative books when learning strings; but the texts can be dense). For example, the first posts in the series, as a preface to Vol. 1 of Polchinski I start with the non-relativistic string \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/notes-on-string-theory-the-nonrelativistic-string/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/notes-on-string-theory-the-nonrelativistic-string/) \] and the relativistic free-point particle \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/notes-on-string-theory-relativistic-free-point-particle/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/notes-on-string-theory-relativistic-free-point-particle/) \], which many will know from undergraduate physics. As a preface to Vol. 1 of Polchinski, I also build on the idea how string theory may first be developed as a generalisation of point particle theory \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/20/notes-on-string-theory-the-nambu-goto-action-for-the-relativistic-string/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/20/notes-on-string-theory-the-nambu-goto-action-for-the-relativistic-string/) \], which may help with some demystification and build some intuition. These posts can be read alongside Polchinski and perhaps more pedagogical textbooks (e.g., Zwiebach) to aid the inquisitive reader.

In string theory, the amazingly beautiful results that really bring the maths and physics to life are in the technical details! There are already a lot of popular science communications blogs (not my strength!), and so I am trying to still be maths heavy and yet more accessible and pedagogical (there is probably a limiting a point). As I am learning as I go when it comes to writing, I wanted to share these posts, firstly, and also share that constructive feedback on the posts would be helpful when writing future entries. For example, are complete derivations more useful without skipping many steps? That is, would people like to see the maths in full? Or would people mainly like to see the key equations mixed with the use of more intuitive language?

As an aside, right now my research is mainly in Double Field Theory and the doubled string, and so I plan to write a lot on these topics and such other related topics as generalised geometry and emergent gravity.

5505,ggueuk,[Experimental Physics] Viability of doing an experiment on effect of temperature on superconductor-based maglev?,"I'm a high school student who's been tasked with doing a research project, and I've opted to do mine in Physics. I've chosen the topic on superconductivity and I want to investigate the effect of temperature on a superconducting levitation system (with direct applications to maglev trains).

The experiment would be seeing the effect of temperature on a model such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPqEEZa2Gis). I've been meaning to cool the superconductor down to specific temperature and investigate its effect on how well the 'vehicle' remains suspended. I would like to hear your thoughts and whether it could be a viable experiment that could produce reasonable results, and if I could improve it.

I've also been having trouble finding specific materials. I've been looking for a YBaCuO ceramic based superconductor (and I realize this may not be the most appropriate place to ask), but I would want to know where I could purchase one. The research I've done has shown me that if the disk is coated with YBaCuO and not entirely composed of it, it could better exhibit flux pinning, which is what I'm hoping to achieve and demonstrate. Could someone confirm this or whether using a disk entirely composed of it is feasible?

&amp;#x200B;

I will make it short. 

I have wasted most of my 20's. I got Bachelor in Business Administration, but to be honest i got it because of my family. I have worked at banks for some time but not for long because i was feeling that it was not my thing. I wanted to make a change earlier too, but i had some promises with raise and so on but in the end my salary always stayed low (barely covering my needs) and i worked liked a hell as all we do. Later (at the age of 25) i started to learn IT by myself, i always loved tech and loved video games, i always liked to solve tech related problems on my own so i learned the basics and was lucky enough to change the job. Yes, salary still not good (about 200$ per month) but as junior help desk no complains, at least it is job i am interested in and i learn new things. I won't proclaim that i am IT expert, of course, i am not. Later i tried to learn some web dev and was able to create very simple webpage for my company. (no financial reward for that, but it was experience for me at least). From late 25 to 26 i was in jail because of drug use, at late 27 i managed to recover my job as junior IT help desk, my mind was not in right place after jail thing and even though i know it sounds like excuse i needed some time to get myself together. Now i am 28 feeling like wasted my 20's and i really did ( most part thanks to my video game addiction), i feel like if i do nothing about my life now than it will be too late. I think of learning programing, but to do that i know that i will need math and physics, i know that most of programming does not require that, but knowing this two is big plus and specially in fields like machine learning and AI which i see is our future. 

I know you will be interested in what am i expecting to get and achieve by learning these two. Well as we all i want to achieve some more or less stable job with normal income. And on the other hand i have genuine interest of these fields (IT, Programming, AI) 

I want to know how realistic it is for someone of my age to achieve this? 

If hursh but real answer is no, please let me know that too, because false hope is the worst one.

I realised how flawed the education system is especially in a country like India where everything is reduced to mere formulas and everyone is interested in ' how to do ' rather than ' why to do ' 
Physics, was something I hated. I was scared of it. 
I subconsciously knew it was something more , obviously I was busy playing games and wasting my time. 
Fast Forward to 4 months ago when I discovered physics for what it is. 
When I got to know how natural it is. It's everything that has ever really existed. 
I'm deeply interested in the subject. I'm weak in mathematics but I'm sure I'll be able to learn it. I had no motive earlier. I have only motive now. I've studied physics and mathematics from youtube and random coursera courses, it's just introductory but I don't know how to proceed, I don't have a path that I can't follow, knowledge is immense but I want to go step by step.
I want to pursue a degree in physics from a university that's not based in India. Education in India needs a lot of improvement. I'll do it when I've achieved a lot in life. I'll fix the education system. For now, I really want help, money is a really important factor for me since I don't belong to a rich family, I'll have to do everything on my own. 
I'm sure there is a way to attain what I wish to attain. I'm ready to put in efforts, it'll be a huge help if any one of you can guide me towards a path. It'll be a huge help. Thankyou.",0,2020-05-08 11:39:37,physics
5580,gfvilx,"Follow up to first post, additional information.","Hi again,

I realized that in my first post, I didn't properly introduce myself. I am a retired telecom engineer/manager who also was trained as a Nuclear reaction physicist, Ph.D University of Notre Dame, 1984.

I began creating my many-body gravitational simulation in 1982 (?) and have been working on it off and on for decades. The simulation essentially was created in a vacuum, with no help or understanding of modern techniques and as such is the product of my physics training and my own warped little brain (as I mentioned in one reply yesterday that I think of myself as the Forest Gump of physicists, not too bright, a bit slow but genuine.). 

For those who may be interested, I had some questions from you all in my last post, so I updated my website with some supporting information regarding the accuracy and precision of my simulation. [Here is a link](https://riodsim.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/6/7/56677737/191107_computeenginetests.pdf) to that presentation. In addition to those tests, there is a discussion in that presentation on numerical equivalency and its relation to my simulation and perhaps other simulations.  

In addition, I have created small presentation that [describes my simulation](https://riodsim.weebly.com/uploads/5/6/6/7/56677737/riodfeaturespressentation.pdf) and some of its internal workings. Also, here is [my website address](https://riodsim.weebly.com/). There is contact information at the site should anyone want more private communications.

I have begun to wonder:  Is it possible that the rate at which time passes is actually not constant? 

I am a mathematician with interest in physics.  My Bachelor's minor was physics so I understand the basic principles of special relativity and time dilation caused by moving at very fast speeds, but my question is about the ""universal"" passage of time that we observe in non-relativistic situations. Have we ever seriously considered that this might not have been truly constant over the life of the universe?

My knowledge of cosmology is limited to what I have seen in documentaries, but it seems to make sense to me that in the very beginning of the universe when everything was very densely clustered that this may have somehow affected space-time so much that time itself may have been altered on the universal scale.  And perhaps as the universe has become more spread out the passage of time has evened out to what we perceive now?

Given that we currently measure universal time via radiation cycles of cesium, perhaps those cycles would have occurred at a different rate if they were observed earlier vs. later in the life span of the universe.",10,2020-05-08 09:49:24,physics

Also this idea makes no sense when looking the ray diagram of a converging planoconvex lens.

&amp;#x200B;

So… What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?

**1. Electric potential energy of the electrons and the protons.**

It is equal to the work that would be required to bring them together, which would be higher if they were further apart, therefore that’s why we say that larger atomic orbitals have higher energy.

The so-called “chemical energy”–which is due to the formation of chemical bonds–is just a subset of this.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Kinetic energy of everything that changes position inside that molecule relative to other parts of the molecule:**

* electrons
* protons (this could be split further into elementary particles)
* neutrons (this could be split further into elementary particles)

This should include the so-called “molecular vibrations”.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Kinetic energy of the molecule as a whole, relative to an external point.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Magnetic potential energy.**

It is equal to the cooperative effect of the spin-bearing molecular entities.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Gravitational potential energy.**

Infinitesimal, but it exists because the molecule as a whole has a net mass, and one could go in even more detail here and look at all the elementary particles from its composition that have mass and gravitational potential energy in relation to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Nuclear binding energy.**

It is the minimum energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus, thus overcoming the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together.

One could go into even more detail and talk about the strong force that keeps quarks together to form neutrons and protons, aka the quantum chromodynamic binding energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Rest energy.**

This could be considered a synonym for mass, since all the elements with mass from the molecule have a potential energy due to the energy-mass equilvance that follows from the special theory of relativity.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

\- Thermal energy follows because of 2. and 3.

\- Radiant energy is temporary. But indeed, if you’d take a big sample of molecules, it’s likely that some of them would be in an excited state, therefore, in time, they’d give off photons when orbitals drop in electric potential energy.",3,2020-05-07 14:27:23,physics

5670,gexzaa,Grapes forming a star or black hole in space due to electromagnetic radiation?,"I recently learned you can make plasma in a microwave with 2 grapes. My understanding of the science behind it (correct me if I’m wrong) is that microwaves use a frequency of 2.45ghz and a wavelength of 12cm. To the microwave the grapes might as well be water, and the refractive index for microwaves in water is about 10(closer to 9 but let’s go with the round number.) so the microwaves inside the grape move about 10x slower and have a wavelength about a tenth of its length in the air. So inside the grape it has a wavelength of about 1.2 cm which is about the size of the grape. With electromagnetic radiation things get strange when an objects size is equivalent to the wavelength of the radiation. the microwaves get sort of trapped in the grape and because of this it heats from the inside and energy builds in the center. Now if you put two grapes next to each other or touching then there will be interactions between the electric fields of one grape and the other. When the grapes are touching then all the energy will gather at the point of contact between the grapes and then it will cause sparks. These sparks are created because the electric fields of the grapes are strong enough to ionize the air(and potassium and sodium atoms in the grape) and then that creates ions which receive energy from the microwaves which then becomes plasma. So after all that(it is highly likely I got multiple things wrong) my question has to do with black holes. Specifically a Kugelblitz. So, theoretically, if you had a field in space of electromagnetic radiation and microwaves with a wavelength of 12cm and then you put two grapes that continuously made contact(despite this being basically impossible in a vacuum without some sort of mucilage) would it create plasma, and then would the plasma continuously gain heat and energy from the radiation until it got so hot and the wavelengths got so short that eventually it would be a perpetually expanding ball of plasma and gamma radiation similar to our sun? Would it be possible for the concentration of radiation on what was once the grape to become so intense that it’s energy formed an event horizon and became self trapped? If it were to become a star, rather than a concentrated point of radiation resulting in a kugelblitz, would it eventually collapse in on itself and possibly form a stellar black hole? I havent taken any physics classes (not even in highschool) so I apologize if everything I am asking about is completely wrong. I started thinking about this about an hour ago and I find the concept of a grape forming a black hole or star incredibly humorous so I am very curious if it is theoretically possible.",0,2020-05-06 21:19:34,physics

5695,geon0b,Can someone elaborate on this idea that space is an emergent property?,"Taken from this article: https://www.space.com/quantum-gravity.html



""Theorists discovered in the late 1990s that descriptions of a simple, box-like universe including gravity were mathematically equivalent to a picture of a flat universe with only quantum physics (and no gravity). The ability to jump back and forth between the descriptions suggests that space may not be a fundamental ingredient of the cosmos but rather a side effect that emerges from particle interactions.


As hard as it might be for us mortals embedded in the fabric of space to imagine, the relationship between space and particles might be something like the one between room temperature and air molecules. Physicists once thought of heat as a fluid that flowed from a warm room to a cool room, but the discovery of molecules revealed that what we sense as temperature ""emerges"" from the average speed of air molecules. Space (and equivalently, gravity) may similarly represent our large-scale experience of some small-scale phenomenon. ""Within string theory, there are pretty good indications at this point that space is actually emergent,"" Engelhardt said.""

I'm not sure that I'm following what is being said here.

We are live in a world having energy everywhere. Energy is inside as well as outside the body. Air,water,soil,fire and sun are various sources of energy. The source which are extensively used are conventional source and which are not used excessively are non-conventional source of energy. Conventional sources fulfill the major part of the demand of energy and non conventional are alternate sources of energy.

Alright, so I know the very basics of perpetual motion and how it is [practically] impossible. I know the three laws of thermodynamics. I know the history of it. So these are my main questions: 

1. If perpetual motion could potentially change the universe by creating more energy than than it needs to sustain itself in motion, then why isn’t there more information on the subject/ more scientists looking into the matter?

2. Why in the first ever “design of perpetual motion” was it a wheel with “MURCURY” that displaced the weight instead of water or sand or any other form of weight? The reason I bring this up is because a lot of perpetual motion ideas involve magnetism, electromagnetism, and I’m wondering how mercury could interact with magnets. 

I’m also wondering this because mercury seems to be a key ingredient in “time travel, alien UFO advances, ect.” (This is all personal speculation and somewhat unreliable research I guess)

Just please keep the answers reasonably accessible, think general public level.

So as far as I understand, the closer you travel to the speed of light, the greater the effect of time dilation is on you (the slower your clock is relative to a ""stationary object""). (Miniquestion: shouldn't that object be relative to you travelling near the speed of light and having more time dilation?). Now in movies, they say that when you hypothetically travel beyond the speed of light, you end up travelling to the past, as in arriving before you left, but that makes no sense to me. If near the speed of light it is YOUR clock that is slowing down, then wouldn't travelling faster make YOUR clock move backwards, as in you arrive after you left but you are like a year younger or something.

I know that there are many paradoxes here, like according to what I said, if you press a button to go faster than the speed of light, then the clock of your vehicle moves backwards and as a result the button is ""unpressed"" or even if that doesn't happen, what ever feul you use will have ejected from your space ship, how would the reaction in the engine go backwards if part of the feul is no longer on the ship, and so on. The only way to resolve these paradoxes is for the clock of the entire universe to go back wards.

I am currently using IDL in my research project along with Linux but I want to become proficient in Python for sure and possibly another language or two. There is a pretty good quality course through EdX and Coursera but I'm wondering if there might be better ones to use? I don't really care about being able to have an official certificate or anything since the skills speak for themselves and you generally aren't required to prove how you learned the coding, just that you can do it. But it would be nice to have taken the course/courses through some online platform that is trusted and well-known in the physics community if I'm already committing to taking something. (Also I can't take it through my school because I am out of state student and can't secure funding for summer courses and it is not required for me to graduate anyways).

Any input is appreciated! I'd also love any suggestions on what type of languages to learn besides Python. I know there is C, C+ and C++ but I am hoping to learn the languages that would be most useful to me (I will be focusing my research on modeling astrophysical systems and spectroscopic data analysis as well. Currently focused on protoplanetary disks but wanting to mostly study galactic systems and dark matter halos).

So I am at a turning point in my education. Currently I have taken an intro to proofs course and a proof based linear algebra course. Initially, I wanted to be a math/physics major, but now that is not exactly possible (reasons out of my control). Now I have to decide between math and physics. I should say I have taken the general calc based physics courses. As of now there are 2 schedules for my sophomore year (excluding non-STEM classes). The math one,

Discrete Math (Lovász)
Proof Based Vector Calculus (prof wrote book)
Abstract Algebra (Dummit or similar)
Topology (Munkres)
Number Theory (Ireland and Rosen)
Complex Analysis (Marsden and Hoffman).

The Physics would be 

Proof Based Vector Calculus (prof wrote book)
Complex Analysis (Marsden and Hoffman)
Vibrations and Waves (prof wrote book)
Modern Physics (Taylor).

Just to give you an idea. I deeply deeply appreciate the math that I am doing right now in linear algebra because it is such a beautiful structure. I loved learning proofs, and even though I suck at them right now, I want to get better. But at my heart I have also always wanted to do physics (username). I am honestly not sure what to do. If I get off either track right now I can't go back. There is no way to not diverge (no pun intended) right now. The departments compare pretty well. Weekly in the physics department I see one of the most famous textbook authors for E&amp;M, quantum and the like. Profs who are on the editorial board of the American Journal of Physics. Leading research being done by people widely recognized nationally. While in the math department there are people that are winning Goldwater Scholarships, profs that are close with some of the worlds leaders in math (think Fermat's Theorem), many NSF graduate fellowships, and in general a lot of NSF funding. I guess I'm just trying to rationalize that the departments are both good in their own ways. But at the end of the day I can't bear to let myself release from either math or physics. I also don't feel like I can succeed in either math or physics in a way. I feel so, beat down. Like I won't be able to do it. Mainly because my grades haven't been great (first semester of college trial and error, and second semester being... well coronavirus among many many other things that happened in my life and lastly summer research being cancelled cause you know coronavirus). PErhaps this isn't the best place to put this. I just have been writhing for the past month trying to figure out what to do.

An example would be akin to astronomy, as we draw a constellation by assigned stars into a pattern, would it be possible to take pieces of matter at complete,absolute rest and “draw”/“assign” a molecule of gold configuration?
I know nothing is supposed to be at rest, but if matter did reach an absolute, complete rest?

Or maybe a better visual is to take an existing molecule of cold and then strip it of the energy to stay attached but not in such a way to damage the structure. So, instead of disintegrated the gold by wrecking its structure but can you leave it in place and remove all of its energy?

The other question is since matter is conserved, is there a progression to that? Example if I lose a pound of body weight, does the matter I am no longer carrying stay in the form I lost it in or can it/does it change into whichever forms suit the loss?
Does water lost mean water,itself, gained or is it conserved by component? Molecules and energy?
What happens when energy slows down and becomes matter,  thereby adding one kind of “content” or when matter speeds up into energy?

These might be dumb questions, I don’t know. I was thinking how dark matter might exist and I had the tough that it is a form of organized matter that has no motion of any kind but still mAintains structure integrity.",11,2020-05-04 07:27:43,physics

Hope you guys can help with this project that could help me alot. Hope you can learn med 2-3 methods

From a power plant, 25 MW of electrical power must be transmitted over a single 100 km long high voltage line.

We must now consider what significance it would have if the power plant connected the high voltage line with a voltage drop of 230 V instead of the 400 kV used in practice.

a) Calculate the currents that should go if the power plant delivers 25 MW when connected to 230 V respectively. 400 kV.

b) What is the resistance of the high voltage cable if it is made of aluminum and has a diameter of 5.0 cm.

c) How much power should the current calculated in (a) have in the high voltage line? Comment on the result.

d) Calculate the loss rate at the power transfer of 400 kV.

e) How long can a high voltage line up to 400 kV be if the loss must not exceed 5%?

I'm struggling to understand the influence of lift force and air resistance. From my understanding air resistance is just here to slow down a moving object by resisting it's movement, I've tried implementing air resistance in such way that depending on how much of the surface of the paper faces the ground, the drag coefficient evolves, here is an example:  


 https://imgur.com/6W1rmG8 The paper is parallel to the ground and has a drag coefficient of around 0.85  
 https://imgur.com/AGlb5lw After hitting an obstacle on one of the corner while falling, the paper gained some torque and started rotating, I use the green area to calculate the drag coefficient.  


This method successfully slows down/accelerates the paper depending on it's rotation but it never stops to rotate after hitting the object. Also when the paper falls, it falls perfectly straight which isn't the case in real life at all.  


So I'm wondering, is the ""gliding"" movement of a sheet of paper the result of a lift force or have I implemented my air resistance wrong ?

Because this was always on the back of my head about how it would have been like if I did an Astronomy degree, I am planning to do something similar but instead of MIT, I’m choosing Leicester’s (UK) Physics &amp; Astronomy courses.

Since I’ve lived in Leicester for a few years I managed to compile all the necessary materials by using the Uni library and getting guidance from some professors at an Open Day, with one of them I still keep in touch by email because he found my idea interesting. Now I’ve moved back to my home country and because I work remote for 4 hours a day I have a lot of free time on my hands.

I’ve looked at all the course modules, bought from ebay or downloaded the necessary ebooks in the recommended reading list below and also compiled the examination papers from previous years by subject. I found most examination papers on StuDocu and at the University library.

When I will get stuck with some of these materials and I will certainly will without a doubt, I plan to use Physics Stack Exchange forums like I did before. In parallel I’m also learning Python so that I can use the Astropy library.

Instead of formulating   
a QFT on a fixed background spacetime, we do away with spacetime altogether and hope that Lorentz covariant QFT emerges in some appropriate limit. 

These ideas are not new, but seem to be gaining traction recently, with Sean Carroll being a vocal supporter.  I certainly find it quite an attractive area of research.

However, if this approach were correct, it would seem to render Lorentz covariance a complete ""coincidence"": given a Hilbert space with some factorisation into spatial sites, we shouldn't expect a randomly chosen Hamiltonian to generate anything like Lorentz invariant dynamics. Even if we constrain the Hamiltonian to be local (with respect to the factorisation) we'll almost always end up with a non-Lorentzian evolution.  

As a concrete example, consider the quantization of a real scalar field φ. We know that the Hamiltonian  density H = ∏\^(2) + |∇φ|\^(2) + m\^(2)φ\^(2) gives us Lorentz-covariant dynamics, but unless we had the explicit goal of Lorentz-covariance, how would we know to choose this Hamiltonian over any other? This problem only gets worse when multiple fields are present, which we want to all be Lorentz-covariant with the same speed of light c. On the other hand, the Lagrangian/path integral approach is manifestly Lorentz-covariant from the start, and doesn't face the same problems.

I'd be grateful if anyone can explain how ""emergent spacetime"" approaches deal with this issue - or do they just ignore it?

Since an integral measures a net change in the independent variable over a change of the dependent variable, the work done by kinetic energy should be a net change in the magnitude of net force over a displacement. The dot product implies we are only considering the magnitude of net force. From this, if the initial limit is 0 and the final limit is some arbitrary position r, the integral should compute to 1/2mv^2. If this is true, why is it that every online article I’ve read about the interpretation of kinetic energy either uses circular reasoning (kinetic energy is that which causes work and work is just a change in kinetic energy) or argues it doesn’t really mean anything; it’s just a useful property to measure because it’s conserved?",3,2020-05-02 14:25:22,physics
5912,gcbzgo,"I have a couple of questions regarding the physics of planet Miller and the black hole it's orbiting from the movie ""Interstellar""","I watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a couple of questions regarding the physics, so I looked for answers. I got them, but I was left even more questions. 

I know that a lot of these questions can be answered by ""this is still a movie, so you can't expect it to be 100% accurate"". I know that. So please bear in mind that this is not a rant about the movie. **This is just an inquiry about how would the nature of such a planet be like, irrespective of the events in the movie.**



1) I wanted to know where the planet got its ""sunlight"" from and I found out that it is in fact the light and heat from the accretion disk that made the environment habitable. It was however not mention how warm was the planet in comparison to earth and I could not find information, regarding real life black holes, on whether the heat from the accretion disks would in fact be not too hot and thus able to sustain life.


2) Dr. Kip Thorne writes in his book ""The Science of Interstellar"" that the planet was tidally locked. Doesn't this mean that half the planet, the dark side, would be frozen, and the other half would be scorching (a Mercury situation), thus eliminating any chance of sustaining life? 


3) If the planet was indeed half frozen half scorching, coupled with the surface being totally covered in water, the giant tidal waves should not have formed. Is that a correct inference?


4) Assuming the planet isn't half cold half hot. Are the giant tidal wave at all a scientifically accurate prediction of what would have happened in such an environment?


5) The gravitational time dilation was 1 hour of Miller = 7 years on Earth. The x60000 factor was a product of Dr. Kip Thorne looking for a stable orbit, the size of the black hole and that the black hole was spinning at close to maximum velocity. Is there a combination of these factors (stable orbit, black hole size and black hole angular velocity) which would allow for a stable orbit with way less time dilation?


6) I also read that the Miller's sky was not accurately depicted. That, because the black hole was much closer to the planet, the event horizon (the accretion disk) should have taken up half the sky with the other half looking warped, similar to how a photo with long exposure would look like. However would this sky be visible from the surface when factoring in the atmosphere or just from orbit?


7) I assumed when factoring in the planet being tidally locked that it's always going to be ""daytime"". Was I correct in this assumption?


8) It was mentioned that the gravity on the planet was ""a punishing 130% of Earth's gravity"". What effect would that have on the evolution of humans living there? I assume they would have a shorter average height.


9) Again, irrespective of what happened in the movie. Say humanity discovers such a planet, do you think that it would be wise to colonize it?",5,2020-05-02 14:10:16,physics

I have a small group of friends to talk about general physics. Few days ago we were discussing about photons and after several hours we noticed something , none of us actually know how photons really work . 

For example : Photons doesn't have any mass (or it's very Small to consider) but they have energy (E=h*v) so what happens in these conditions :

1)massless particle (photon) + photon collision

2) photon + mass (any material with mass) collision

3)photon + electron collision

My current theory is : 

1) Photons probably change their wavelength because other factors are constant but I don't know the ratio since both have no mass

2) Photons probably transfer their energy into mass until photon's wavelength low enough to pass through but what happens when photon has zero energy 

Also I'm not really looking for an answer for these questions . I want to fill my knowledge gaps which preventing me from answering these questions . I think issue is what happens after the Newtonian physics and I don't know where to start because every law I know become useless in quantum physics .

To do that tools from General Relativity has been used and extended to work on a complex Kähler manifold. 

In other words, spacetime has been modelled as a complex manifold instead of a real one. This bears the question - can our 'reality' be fundamentally complex valued? Furthermore can the key to understanding gravity at a quantum scale lie in an extension of GR to a Kähler manifold?",0,2020-05-01 16:54:09,physics

5973,gblj5b,Please fact check me on these claims...,"Edwin Hubble was a brilliant and influential astronomer who lived in the early part of the twentieth century.  In fact, most people regard him as the greatest observational cosmologist of that century. 
 
Interestingly, his most famous discovery horrified him.
  
When Hubble looked at the galaxies in a particular section of the sky, he noticed that they were moving, and that they were moving away from the earth.  When he looked in another section, he noticed the same thing.  And in another section.  And another.  And another.  In fact, he saw that the galaxies were moving away from the earth no matter where he looked in the sky.  

If you have the image of this in your mind, then you will see that the first, most natural, interpretation of this observation is that we are at the center of the universe.  As Stephen Hawking, one of the most famous physicists in history, writes,
 
*“Now at first sight all this evidence that the universe looks the same whichever direction we look in might seem to suggest there is something special about our place in the universe. In particular, it might seem that if we observe all other galaxies to be moving away from us, then we must be at the center of the universe”* (A Brief History of Time 44-45).

Here is how Hubble put it: 

*“Such a condition would imply that we occupy a unique position in the universe, analogous, in a sense, to the ancient conception of a central earth”* (The Observational Approach to Cosmology 40).

Fascinating.

However, Hubble does not say that he was fascinated by the idea that we are at the center of the universe.  He says that he was horrified by it: “Such a favoured position, of course, is intolerable,” he writes.  He goes on to say that he wants “to escape the horror of a unique position,” (46) and freely admits that “the unwelcome supposition of a favoured location must be avoided at all costs” (Hubble 40 ).

Horror?  Escaping the most obvious conclusions of his research at all costs?  Does this sound like good science? 
 
Why was he so horrified about the conclusion that we are at the center of the universe, so horrified, in fact, that he was desperate to escape it at all costs? 

In plain words, Hubble was an atheist, the sort of atheist who does not want God to exist. 

And he saw very clearly that our being at the center of the universe suggests that we are a special creation of God.

Someone who is as intelligent and desperate as Hubble was will inevitably find a different way of explaining his observations.  And Hubble did.  Rather than accepting the conclusion that the universe has a center, and that we are at the center, he adopted the view that the universe has no real center at all.  He claimed that if we were to fly to any distant galaxy, set up a telescope, and look around, then that galaxy would look like the center.  To his credit, he admits that the idea of our being at the real center of the universe “cannot be disproved” (40).  He also admits that this alternative explanation, which says there is no real center, is “sheer assumption” (42), but he chooses to believe it in spite this, and in spite of the fact that it proposes something contrary to our experience because, otherwise, he must accept that we are the center of the universe, with all that this implies.  Below, he admits how contrary to experience his alternate explanation is:
 
*[I]t leads to a rather remarkable consequence, for it demands that, if we see the nebulae all receding from our position in space, then every other observer, no matter where he may be located, will see the nebulae all receding from his position. However, the assumption is adopted. There must be no favoured location in the universe, no centre…* (42).

Stephen Hawking also chose to believe this alternative explanation : 

*“There is, however, an alternate explanation: the universe might look the same in every direction as seen from any other galaxy too.  We have no scientific evidence for, or against, this assumption [the assumption that the universe has no center].  We believe it only on grounds of modesty: it would be most remarkable if the universe looked the same in every direction around us, but not around other points in the universe.”* (A Brief History of Time 45).",7,2020-05-01 11:41:22,physics

Theoretically lets assume we are in a closed system and we can convert all energy into another form of energy without loss.

We take x amount mass and turn it into y amount of energy and then into a laserbeam that carries the same y amount of energy. If we send it straight up (in a vacuum tube), even though theres gravity pulling it down it still moves at a speed equal to c. And carries y amount of energy to a higher place. 

Then once it's up there we take the y amount of energy and turn it back into x amount of mass (E=mc^2). Then drop it down and make it turn something on the way so we create energy. 

When the mass is back at ground level. You have x amount of mass and the extra energy you created from the mass falling down.

1)  Is there just one major and it’s called “physics” or is each branch of physics it’s own major?  Or do you major in physics and then specialize? If so how does one choose to specialize down the road?

2)  I am most interested in learning about the Standard Model and Special Relativity.  What branch of physics are these in?  I believe the Standard Model is part of Particle Physics?  If I want to make both of these part of my life in the future would that be reasonable?

3) Going off of questions 2,  what percent of the Standard Morel and Special Relativity are their branch.      Is the Standard Model 50% of Particle Physics.  10%?  100%?  There must be other theories besides the Standard Model but are they relevant?

4)  What are the branches of physics?  How many are there? 

5) Does anybody have links to graphics or articles that would help me understand the logistics of physics?  Even if it doesn’t answer my questions that I’m asking right now I’m sure I’ll learn something.   My questions might sound stupid but it’s crazy how unhelpful google has been.

I want to build a solar powered battery that discharges into a usb so you could charge your phone or basically whatever has a usb connection to charge.

I found some mini solar panels that have a wire output of an anode and cathode, but I have not learned much on solar panels. Do the panels change and have a battery internally? So would I just set up a voltage regulator (which might not be necessary because they are low power panels) to lead to the usb? The ones I found had a picture with p type and n type, but I am unsure if that is just to generate current from solar energy which would need to be linked to another battery before building a voltage regulator to lead to the usb.

This idea is early in the works but do I need a separate battery that is charged by the panels and do  I need a voltage regulator with diodes or is that unnecessary and I just slap a usb output to cathode and ground the anode?

6031,gaylu4,Spin and the Lorentz Force - Electrons moving through magnetic fields question,"Hello,

I'm taking a quantum mechanics class this semester and I've been learning about various things, one of which being the concept of spin and the Stern-Gerlach experiment. 

Given that the electron has an intrinsic spin, angular momentum, and therefore magnetic dipole moment, we see that a neutral Silver atom can be deflected by a non uniform magnetic field with the Force given by F = grad (mu . B)

For this reason, I was wondering if the Lorentz Force F = q(E + v x B) is actually sufficient to describe the path an electron takes in a magnetic field generally. Am I correct in thinking that the actual path would be determined by the sum of the Lorentz and Stern-Gerlach forces, or is spin somehow taken care of secretly in the magnetic field term of the Lorentz force?

I'm also finding myself a bit confused on the implications of a quantized spin as well. In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, it seems taking measurements along one component affects the others. If there was a strange magnetic field that was strong in the X direction, then the Z direction, along the path the electron is taking through space - do these count as measurements as if we put them through a Stern-Gerlach device? Would the particles path then 'split'? At what point does this split happen?

I would appreciate any insight you guys could give me on spin in general really.",3,2020-04-30 11:10:41,physics

I don't even know anything from a mathematical point of view. But I know about some concepts in layman's terms. I was thinking that just as objects in space have an effect on spacetime called gravity, what if, for electrons and protons, along with their electromagnetic force, they also produce such an effect. I thought this because I read somewhere that a black hole is extremely dense. The mass of a electron is in the order of 10.pow(-31) and the size is 10.pow(-15), so volume would be approx 10.pow(-45). So, the density would be 10.pow(14). Considering the size, I would say it's pretty dense. What if this would be bending the fabric inside of an atom in a similar manner large bodies bend spacetime? Ofc, this would be complete bullshit, but what if, modifying the general relativity somehow could present us with a theory that also describes the motion of sub-atomic particle, like a theory for everything?

We especially have AP students in mind, since AP testing will be very unusual this year and we want to provide all the help we can give. These review sessions will be completely free, and open to various schools across the country via ZOOM (no account needed). 

These sessions will consist of a 90-minute review of the material the students have questions on, as frequently as we have interest and availability for. In the absence of questions, we will provide some practice problems to work on as well as discuss some commonly confusing topics.

The next one will be **this Saturday 1-2:30 PST**. If you are a teacher who thinks that your AP students will benefit from the review session, please forward this to your students, and tell them to email [charlie.cummings@berkeley.edu](mailto:charlie.cummings@berkeley.edu) with ""\[SPS Online Review\]"" in the subject line in order to RSVP, along with:

Couldn't it just be that without being measured, that a photon, being in superposition goes through both slits?

By that ^, I mean: Couldn't the photon exists in two separate realities (two realities where it goes through both slit 1 and slit 2, thus creating the interference pattern). 

What if The photon goes through both slits at the same time, because without measurement it exists in two potential realities (a reality for each slit) at the same time?

Could the interference pattern be the result of two realities existing at once when the experiment was conducted?

Also could the measurement tools/devices used in the experiment cause the collapse of the wave pattern, and cause the photons to act as waves because the measurement tools themselves exist in one specific reality? 

By this I mean, because the measurement devices exist in one reality, then wouldn't that mean they can only measure the photon in one specific reality? And if the photon is being measured by a tool that exists in one specific reality, then couldn't it be that the photon also only can exist in 1 specific reality as it cannot be in both just 1 reality, and also 2 realities at the same time, because idk, maybe it would violate some law of Quantum Physics for this to not be the case?",13,2020-04-29 11:37:47,physics

It seems to me that the most logical sensor to use (accelerometers), are incredibly inaccurate due to small errors in orientation which cause immense errors over time. A research paper I read said that with only 1 degree of error in orientation the position was off by 6km after 10 minutes...

The air pressure on the diaphragm is 50 psi. 

We ran a pump into a line that was deadheaded, by accident (i.e. into a closed pipe). We thought the product went somewhere, so we tried to blow it out with air at 120 psi, through a 3/8"" air line. Product fed into the air line. 

What is going on here? Is this some sort of hydrodynamic effect? How could the product / air in the enclosed pipe be at a higher pressure than 50 psi? A 12"" piston pushing on a 3"" pipe should trade force for distance, not vice versa.

As is known from the Onsager rule, the SdH oscillation frequency is proportional to the extrema of the cross-sectional area of the Fermi surface perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field.  Now, suppose i have a material, with an open(or at least partially open) Fermi surface(for instance, like Copper has).

For the sake of simplicity lets assume the Fermi surface is a cylinder pointed along the k\_z direction. In an SdH setup where the angle between the field and the z axis(in kspace) of the sample is controlled, as the magnetic field vector approaches the x-y plane the cross-sectional area grows as 1/cos(theta), where theta being the angle between the magnetic field and k\_z. In a certain angle, the cross section of this Fermi surface no longer resides only in one Brillouin Zone, and it extends to adjacent BZs, that is to higher(and lower) k\_z values. The question is as follows - What happens, when the cross section extends beyond one BZ? Is the area relevant to the Onsager rule calculated in a single BZ? or is it considered to be the largest/smallest closed area in k-space? Or is it perhaps more tricky than that?

6150,g9qtzm,Question: Can one say that entropy in a closed system always increases due to probability only?,"So, I am a chemistry student who believes understanding the physics behind chemistry is vital. After hearing bad responses as to why entropy always increases I decided to try and make a little story in my head to explain it.  I just want to know if there is any truth to what I came up with:

So, if you have molecules or energy in some other form in a specific location and you give them more energy of any form, you create the potential to generate movement. The moment this happens, you increase the TOTAL number of configurations the system as a WHOLE can have. If this is the case, by letting time pass, we allow for those different configurations of the system to exist. Just like you allow a coin to flip heads or tails upon flipping it. But with system configuration, things are a little bit more exciting than with a coin. Because if you increase the volume of this system by just a little, you infinitely increase the number of configurations the system can have, and as we increase our observation window, it becomes infinitely many times more unlikely for a system to return to a position where energy is concentrated in a small volume. Not because nature is a magical entity that enjoys complexity, but because if motion isnt set off with infinitely precise (therefore infinitely unlikely) the ""AMOUNT"" of possible system configurations that result from time passing, simply overwhelms the possibility of the a more organized state. In the light of this argument, things like spontaneous life formation and the expansion of the universe make a LOT of sense, and in my case, with chemistry, a scenario that increases the entropy of the system is simply a scenario that is more likely to come into existence for every unit time due to the total amount of disorganized scenarios being greater than that of organized scenarios.

6159,g9no1k,Quantum Electrochemical Equilibrium: Quantum Version of the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz Equation,"The resting membrane voltage of excitable cells such as neurons and muscle cells is determined by the electrochemical equilibrium of potassium and sodium ions. This voltage is calculated by using the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation. However, from the quantum perspective, ions with significant quantum tunneling through closed channels can interfere with the electrochemical equilibrium and affect the value of the membrane voltage. Hence, in this case the equilibrium becomes quantum electrochemical. Therefore, the model of quantum tunneling of ions is used in this study to modify the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation in such a way to calculate the resting membrane voltage at the point of equilibrium. According to the present calculations, it is found that lithium—with its lower mass—shows a significant depolarizing shift in membrane voltage. In addition to this, when the free gating energy of the closed channels decreases, even sodium and potassium ions depolarize the resting membrane voltage via quantum tunneling. This study proposes the concept of quantum electrochemical equilibrium, at which the electrical potential gradient, the concentration gradient and the quantum gradient (due to quantum tunneling) are balanced. Additionally, this concept may be used to solve many issues and problems in which the quantum behavior becomes more influential.

If those ""anti-photons"" exist the speed of light will be slower that the speed of darkness because if you produce a shadow on the moon (almost impossible to do) it will travel in a matter of second all the moon (by all I mean the side that the shadow is projected on to)

6200,g9a6pq,Thoughts on the Yang-Mills existence gap,"The following text was written with the previous reasoning of using the maths behind the compton effect in order to extrapolate the minimum mass, before the particle goes FTL upon impact:

  

The problem is unsolvable, as the value we get won’t be a constant. In order to solve the problem an approximation of the maximum speed an object with no mass can have is required. We could of course use:

v=lim (n-&gt;c) n

However, this wouldn’t satisfy relativity, as it doesn’t have a solid value. In order to calculate the true maximum velocity an object could potentially have, we need to take the force used to accelerate the object. This normally wouldn’t be a problem, however in this case, we need the smallest possible force acting upon the body with the maximum theoretical mass. The objects mass, although still susceptible to the same problematics discussed later, would be much easier to approximate. It would be the Schwarzschild mass of an object with a rotation speed approaching that of light. In order to get the speed limit, we would have to apply the least force onto it, until we’ve reached a place where any more force would result in a velocity ≥ that of light. This force would be the gravitational (as it is the weakest) pull of two Yang-Mills objects, separated by their Hubble spheres. However, Hubble spheres’ radius increases over time, and as such the force can be written as:

Fmin = lim (n-&gt;0) n

This will intervene with most of the math required in order to calculate the masses themselves. As such, the Yang-Mills existence gap can be written as a function:

f(v, r of the hbble sphere)

, where:

v = (c/Fmin -1)Fmin

, and:

Fmin **≈**  2m(min)G/r of the hubble sphere \^2

Of course the Hubble sphere itself is dependent on time. The last equation is only an approximation using Newton’s law of gravity, as the exact constant would be evaluated by Einstens’.

I wanted to do thesse EdX courses:

[Plasma Physics: Introduction](https://www.edx.org/course/plasma-physics-introduction)

[Plasma Physics: Applications](https://www.edx.org/course/plasma-physics-applications)

To do each course with access to the exercises now costs __$169 USD__ per course. That's $338 USD in total.

I don't understand it, I'd happily pay $30 per course without thinking about it. Perhaps even up to $80 per course if I was sure they were good. But $169 per course is an insane sum of money.

And it's not as though it is a limited resource, the marginal cost for more students is practically nothing. So they could offer lower prices and get far more students for greater profit (as well as enabling education and having a larger audience).

It's a shame that EdX has taken this route, given its aim to remove barriers to education. Even Coursera generally has lower prices with the subscription model (and offers leniency for students and the unemployed).

It seems ever since Udacity showed they could charge huge amounts for renowned courses, everything is shifting to that model for profitability.

I was then told the answer should be Time up &gt; Time down

I believe the justification is with the equation Vfinal - Vinital = (a)t and due to losses because of friction the change in velocity on the way up would be greater than down so the time up would then be greater with a constant acceleration.

6273,g8bn9q,Is it possible to calculate the mass of a planet by comparing the gravity to another planet's?,"I've been trying a certain calculation. For example, let's take a dwarf planet with about 500 kilometer radius. However, that planet has a surface gravity of about 1,000 that of Earth's. All we know about it is it's size and it's surface gravity. So here's my logic. I make the planet multiple times larger, enough to be the same size as Earth. Or in this case, it's get about 12.7 times larger. Then I take into consideration how much it's gravity will decline. In this case, it'd decline by 163.175 times. Making it's surface gravity 6.1 times larger than that of Earth's. And since in this hypothetical their size is the same, therefore the distance from the core to the surface is also the same ( Meaning we have a direct comparison of what the two planets' gravity would be from the same distance. ), that'd mean the only real difference is how dense it is. How much mass is contained in those 6,387 kilometers. So my thinking was that I can simply compare the difference in gravity to determine how much heavier planet A will be to Earth. In which case it will be 6.1 times heavier. However, here comes the problem. Comparing the planet to Earth would give me 6.1 times Earth's mass, for example. But comparing it to another planet would give me a higher or lower than 6.1 Earth's mass as a result. Some calcs differ greatly. Shouldn't I get the same result?

I want to study physics because I have a huge passion for it, especially emerging and advanced fields inc. Quantum Mechanics/Relativity/Astrophysics. Part of me I think prefer the idea of studying physics, I think it's because I dislike the idea of ""missing out"" on fields of study. 

I want to study Engineering (Energy Sector/Mechanical or General \[as wide as possible\]) because I don't particularly like the idea of being locked in an office churning data (if that's the case) and having to compete for or being locked in a project. I also do like creating and innovating systems a bit more than just knowledge and hope to have a profession to (perhaps) innovate and work on personal projects. 

I either look for wide engineering, Engineering science or Engineering with some kind of physics or Just physics. I kinda want to do both somehow and if in the US would minor in physics or double major? And I guess naively want to find the best path to work on systems utilising Advanced physics fields.

 I've got a ""personal brewing"" system that has a glycol based temperature control. The manual says that when the beverage (beer) is being chilled, once the contents at the bottom of the cylindrical  fermenter reach 4 degrees centigrade (39f), an inversion will occur which will cause the cold to rise and all of the contents to become cold. Except this does not work. I use a floating temperature gauge   which confirms the top of the vessel never dips below about 10c (50f).

I think the principle they are referring to is the same principle that  causes water to freeze from the top down, that is expanding density below 4c.

What I am wondering is how this principle works with beverages containing alcohol - alcohol   definitely affects the freezing point, so does it also affect the temperature at which inversion begins to occur? The minimum set point for the chiller is 1C (33.8f). In my uneducated estimation, either the   heat transfer between the glycol and the contents of the vessel is   limited so as to prevent the beverage reaching the 4 degree inversion point, or the inversion point must be lower.

I am wondering if anyone here who might be able to offer some commentary on this? Thanks in advance :)",0,2020-04-25 21:56:02,physics

This problem asks: if there is a particle in the ground state of the harmonic oscillator with an angular velocity w, and then the spring constant suddenly increases, what is the probability of measuring the energy to be (hbar)w/2? It makes sense to me that this is now zero since we have to express our old ground state wave function in terms of the new wave functions, and none of these have an energy eigenvalue of (hbar)w/2.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the highest entropy state -- which can be described as the one with the most micro-states corresponding to a given distribution.  These micro-states are calculated assuming the particles are distinguishable, so interchanges between particles give rise to different micro-states, which can be counted.

However, in the Bose-Einstein distribution, interchange of particles does not lead to a separate micro-state.  So each distribution that satisfies the constraints on particle number and total energy, corresponds to exactly one micro-state.  So the interpretation of the highest entropy distribution cannot be correct, as all distributions have the same entropy.

Is the Bose-Einstein distribution instead perhaps the average of all of these distributions, with equal weights (since they have the same number of micro-states)?",0,2020-04-25 19:32:36,physics

What if gravity is an extra-dimensional gel that we exist within without realizing it, much like a fish in a tank unaware of the water. This 'gel' surrounds us., we swim through it, and yet it exists in some extra-dimensional plane where it can occupy the same space more than once at a time, causing an increased concentration where mass exists in our world. 

This gel like substance has gradients, not dissimilar to those imagined in the space-time graphs we're familiar with, and where mass is concentrated in our 3 dimensions the gel likewise is concentrated causing us to slide down toward the mass, hence the pull. 

This gel, not unlike water, can be changed in form from liquid, solid, and gaseous. Though instead of temperature changes causing the change, the process is driven by mass. 

This 3 state gravitational gel, then, can be fractured into different states based on the concentration of mass in a given location. Therefore when an extremely high level of mass is congregated in one location, such as in a black hole, the gel is fractured into an ice like state causing dark matter, which attributes for the discrepancy in calculating the gravitational effects witnessed in distant galaxies that we can't attribute to mass alone. Dark matter is not able to be perceived as it does not exist in our dimensions, much like the gel, and we simply witness the effects of it. 

Likewise cosmic explosions and other such displacement events cause the gel to be vaporized, once more increasing (beyond the expected calculation of mass alone) the expansion of the surrounding matter, causing dark energy. We can see that things are being pushed apart more than they should, but once more cannot tangibly interact with it or see how or why. 

To my uneducated brain this seems like a feasible explanation to both dark matter and dark energy, while also shedding light on gravity and what force drives it.",0,2020-04-25 10:23:17,physics

Now say there is another reference frame O' moving with velocity v with respect to O in the same direction of P.

Are the energy-momentum tensors T and T' themselves related by the same Lorentz transformation between O and O'?

Now that's a broad topic, but less so is like the history of how things went. In this professor's book he claims that Newton's particle model of light was widely accepted, seemingly only because of his authority, and that it was only with Young's double slit experiment which I think was around 1800 that the wave model became popular.

The manual says that when the beverage (beer) is being chilled, once the contents at the bottom of the cylindrical fermenter reach 4 degrees centigrade (39f), an inversion will occur which will cause the cold to rise and all of the contents to become cold. Except this does not work. I use a floating temperature gauge which confirms the top of the vessel never dips below about 10c (50f). 

I think the principle they are referring to is the same principle that causes water to freeze from the top down, that is expanding density below 4c. 

What I am wondering is how this principle works with beverages containing alcohol - alcohol definitely affects the freezing point, so does it also affect the temperature at which inversion begins to occur? The minimum set point for the chiller is 1C (33.8f). In my uneducated estimation, either the heat transfer between the glycol and the contents of the vessel is limited so as to prevent the beverage reaching the 4 degree inversion point, or the inversion point must be lower.

I am wondering if anyone here who might be able to offer some commentary on this? Thanks in advance :)",0,2020-04-24 17:43:53,physics

6355,g7f8h8,Question: Will all the stars in the sky look brighter the closer I get to a black hole (because of time dilation),"Okay.. So this is a long question. But just bare with me...

So... I've been looking at videos about black holes for an hour or so now and have started to wonder about how relativity, time, gravity, light and the whole shebang works. When thinking about these things, I usually put the universe into ""god mode"" and try to do some thinking experiments on what would happen if X, Y and Z...  


My latest thought is based on what I saw in interstellar, where our heroes visit a planet close to a spinning supermassive black hole. As they leave the mothership and take a trip to the planet and back that took... lets say 8 hours, 7 years had passed back on the mothership due to relativity. Super interesting right?  


Now let's say that we enter ""god mode"" and put ourselves really close to the event horizon of the black hole. We turn off the visuals of accretion disk, any gravitational lensing from the black hole and other visual elements that might mess with us while we are experimenting. Relative time and external elements should still work as normal.  


So.. We're standing here by the edge of a time-warping supermassive black hole, staring out at the universe. Are we now seeing the universe fast forward around us? I think I've seen a documentary that said that it would.... BUT!!! If that is the case... wouldn't that also mean that we are being exposed to fucking HUGE amounts of light, radiation and other stuff while time is passing by?  


Let me expand the example: Let me just add a flashlight with infinite battery life a lightyear or so away from the black hole, and point it at myself. So... if the time dilation is so crazy high that 1000 years passes by for the flashlight and only one second passes by for me. Wouldn't that mean that during one second.. I get blasted with 1000 years worth of light from that flashlight. If we're being crazy and say that the flashlight output a whole joule worth of energy each second. Would that mean that during that one second, I was blasted with 31.5 billion joules? That sounds crazy...  


So... lets go back to the real question at hand: does this mean that all the stars in the sky will look brighter the closer I get to the black hole/the more time is diluted?",0,2020-04-24 14:49:15,physics

6361,g7cnrx,Calculate motor torque,"Hello, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/g6qu2p/free_body_diagram_of_a_wheel_driven_by_a_motor/) on r/AskPhysics and got no answer. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to calculate the torque that a motor needs to translate a vehicle over a surface with a slope theta. I've done my FBD, and the equations that I can derive from it don't seem to fit other analysis I've found on the internet.

 [First analysis.](https://robotics.stackexchange.com/questions/7796/calculating-required-torque?newreg=ede1ac0d87884365a962d6ec189e9561) I understand up until the point they say

&gt;Now, keep in mind that the opposing force and the frictional forces are  both at the point of contact between the wheel and the surface.

This doesn't make sense to me, because the opposing force (the weight component on x axis) acts on the CM, not on the contact point. And this small detail changes all the equation, compared to mine, which I'll show at the end.

After this assumption, they end up with this formula:

 T=mg\*( sin(theta) + u\*cos(theta) )\*R

Second analysis is an online calculator from a motor manufacturer,  [this](https://www.orientalmotor.com/motor-sizing/agv-sizing.html#) is the calculator and this is an screenshot of the calculations:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/stkd9d9iqsu41.png?width=1530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4c3439f139ad6ac47641e3e33e16ebd54a424a5b

They consider extra weight (md1) from the number of wheels (nd1), but let's just assume it's all a single mass. So they basically say that

 F=mg\*( sin(theta) + u\*cos(theta) )

And from there, they derive the torque by multiplying with the R radius ( and efficiency, but it's not relevant for what I'm asking), which is basically the same the other guy has done, so two different source can't be wrong, maybe? 

This is my FBD and my analysis. I've gone another ""analysis route"" by using toque instead of force. I should get the same results if I do the correct procedure, right?

https://preview.redd.it/h6gp9dt5psu41.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=26a15d065a7896b46393977478085b3640e576a8

I've considered that the Fr (friction force) goes upwards, otherwise the wheel would go down. is this assumption correct?

So basically, my torque is

M=mg\*sin(theta)\*R

It lacks the mg\*u\*cos(theta) term.

What's wrong with my analysis?",1,2020-04-24 12:33:20,physics

I was able to follow and determined which ones are true of our universe and which one are so far unconfirmed (eg. he used string theory as the ultimate the true theory of quantum gravity, and I know it's not yet proven.), but I got stumped when coming to the Book: Ring, on the subject of Kerr Black holes.   


In the book, he described a cosmic string, looped in a ten million light years diameter and set spinning around would create naked singularities of Kerr's black hole. The ring shaped singularity of the Black hole would be 300 light years across at the centre of the ring. Beyond the centre of the singularity would be going to another universe, since the timelike curves cannot exit from the other side and continuity must be maintained.

So let's say you have a normal P-N junction arranged like a typical doped silicon cell.  In this scenario, assume the solar cell is **IN THE DARK.**

A voltage will develop between the P-N junction like a normal diode.  Let's say that voltage is 0.7 V.  Current (I) is 0, because the P-N junction is not connected by a wire and it is in equilibrium.

Now, say you take a copper wire and connect the P side with the N side like [this](https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar-cell-with-resistive-load.jpg). 

Now that you've connected the P side with an N side with a wire, does the voltage or current change?  Does the equilibrium change in any way?

My gut says no, but I want to ask this question anyway.

You have a normal solar cell just like described above (without a wire).  A drift voltage develops across the junction of 0.7 V.  Current (I) is 0 because it's in equilibrium.  Now, you **SHINE LIGHT ON IT.**.  Free electrons and hole pairs are formed and they are pushed around by the drift current.

Does this disturb the equilibrium?  Does the drift voltage change?  Like, does that 0.7 V now become 0.4 V?

OK, now you hook up a wire like [this](https://circuitglobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar-cell-with-resistive-load.jpg) again.  Light is still shining.

Does the voltage change?  What is the current here vs the current in the dark?

--------------

Basically, I'm trying to grasp how power is generated by a solar cell.  I've seen all the youtube videos.  From what I've gathered, it works like this:

A PN junction will eventually reach an equilibrium where diffusing electrons from the N-side will cross over to the P-side until an opposing drift voltage is created.  At this point, N-side is slightly positive.  P-side is slightly negative.  When you shine a light on this, lots of free electrons are knocked out of the valence band into the conduction band.  These electrons will be moved by that drift voltage towards the N side.

Now here's where I get sort of confused.  I've tried to fill in the gaps myself.

As electrons move towards the N side, that drift voltage weakens.  It goes from 0.7 V to 0.2 V...or something like that.  Suddenly, there is some diffusion pressure again.  Electrons are going to try and move towards the P side until the drift voltage once again reaches 0.7 V.  If you connect the P side to the N side with a wire...then the electrons will quickly take that conduit towards the P side until the 0.7 V is reached again.  When there is constant sunlight, this never happens....and so a constant current is created.

Does this make sense?  Am I thinking about this correctly?

6455,g66wd4,Understanding the Physics of Molecular Genetics: Understanding Post -Explaining Transcriptional Histone Modification Using Coulomb's Law," Greetings Fellow Scientist,

As I was studying I came to a road block: ""How are histones basic and have a positive charge""? and ""Is the charge of the histone important for transcriptional gene regulation through histone modification""? I was perplexed and my world was slowly coming to an end (Not Really). However, I did some digging and I think I found the answer to my questions. Now I would like you guys to critique my answer, is it logical? What are the flaws? What are the strengths?  (Most of the physics is towards the end)

The Histone proteins H4, H2B, H2A, and H3 are basic and consist primarily of arginine, histidine and lysine ( the Basic Amino Acids). Theoretically, Lewis bases are generally negatively charged thus nucleophilic and Lewis acids are generally positively charged and thus electrophilic however basic amino acids and acidic amino acids are different from the typical acid and base.

Why are they different? Every amino acid has an acidic group, a basic group, and a R group thus one amino acid molecule can have multiple charges based on the environment. The pH environment plays a significant role on the charge of a particular amino acid. An acidic amino acids likes to be a zwitterion in acidic conditions, a neutral amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in a neutral pH conditions and a basic amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in basic conditions. This is where our knowledge of pkas and titrations come in. Acidic amino acids are negative in neutral pH conditions and basic amino acids are positive in neutral pH conditions.

Below is the titration curve of arginine and as you can see, arginine has a positive charge in neutral pH conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

We found the answer! Even though histones are basic, the pH of the nucleus ranges from 6 to 8. Therefore, all of the basic amino acids will have a +1 charge in the nucleus ( At homeostasis) . Because histones are primarily composed of basic amino acids, the charge of the histone will be positive in the nucleus. This is important because DNA is negative and the positive charge of the histones create an attractive bond between the DNA and the histones thus making DNA coil around the histones.

The positive charge on the histones are imperative to the process of gene regulation by histone modification: Transferase enzymes in the nucleus manipulate the charges on the amino acids of the histone proteins by adding a functional group to the histones. For example, lets imagine that we are an arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) and we methylate (tag with -CH3) the positively charged nitrogen's on the arginine amino acids of the histones. This would decrease the positive charge on the histones thus increasing negative charge. If our methylation creates a negative charge on the histone then this would create a kinetic force repelling the new negatively charged histone and the negatively charged DNA molecule (Coulombs Law). This allows space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region and start transcription. Congrats, we just activated gene expression of a gene via histone modification. Now we are a histone demethylase (HDM) and take the methyl groups off of the arginines of the histone protein or demethylate it. The histone will revert back to a positive charge, creating an attractive force between the histone and DNA, closing the space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region. Congrats we have just repressed gene expression!

I must clarify. There are multiple types of transcriptional gene regulation. Adding a methyl group to a lysine vs adding a methyl group to an arginine on a histone could have different effects. This is irrelevant to this discussion but important to be aware of. In this discussion, we are focusing on specifically transcriptional gene regulation via histone modification via changing the charge of the histone. Whether it is a acyl group, a methyl group, exc. Adding or Removing a functional group will change the charge of the histone (either more positive or more negative) thus changing its affinity to DNA. This is explained by Coulombs Law.

&amp;#x200B;

\+F = Attractive force = R increases = Euchromatin

\-F= Repulsive force = R decreases = Heterochromatin

q1 = histone - can be negative or positive based on Histone modification

q2= DNA

r= distance between histone and DNA

Therefore, if you change the charge of a q1 then you changed the distance  r from q1 and q2. The difference in charge is positively correlated with the force of repulsion or attraction between q1 and q2. 

""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"". I shall explain this in shorter terms. Transcriptional Histone modification is a type of nuclear gene expression and involves enzymes adding and removing functional groups in order to change the net charge of the histone proteins.

If DNA is negative and Histone is positive = Heterochromatin = no gene transcription

If DNA is negative and Histone is negative= Euchromatin= gene transcription",3,2020-04-22 13:49:31,physics

6475,g616jh,"(x-post from r/AskPhysics) Accepted into an international photonics MSc with an electrical engineering BSc, suddenly second-guessing myself and feeling out of my depth","Hi y'all,

I (from the US) graduated with my BSEE in December 2018, and have been working full-time in a largely untechnical engineering job (that I strongly dislike) for more than a year now. Over this past week, I have been accepted into two Erasmus Mundus masters programs in Europe, one geared towards microwave engineering/optics and the other dedicated to photonics. The latter had been my top choice for a while now, but nonetheless, it's slowly sunk in that while engineering majors are accepted by the program, the majority of students are physics majors.

Which worries me, because my technical coursework isn't remotely comparable. The highest math I've taken is vector calculus and linear algebra for engineers. I don't have prior optics or photonics experience from undergrad, nor have I taken quantum mechanics or statistical physics - all that should be apparent from the transcript I submitted. The closest I got to any of that was my junior-level semiconductors class which I didn't do particularly well in. What I *did* study in some detail was electromagnetics for engineers, along with RF engineering and antennas, but even that can't compare to the rigor of electrodynamics for physics majors.

Now, my intention is to quit my job (my circumstances allow for it) and review and self-study as much as I can upon committing to a program in the near future, as I've simply forgotten so much over this past year of working. I should have close to four months to do that, assuming no delay caused by COVID-19. Still, I'm worried that even that won't be enough. One former student (physics) I reached out to said studying ""basic"" quantum mechanics in addition to reviewing E&amp;M was enough, and recommended ""Concepts of Modern Physics"" by Beiser for the former, which didn't look too bad. I was also planning to take a crack at the Griffiths QM textbook.

The course content for the 1st semester of the photonics program is on pg. 2-7 [here](https://www.europhotonics.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Programme-Europhotonics_POESII-2017_2018-Marseille.pdf) - I don't know how detailed they will go into, say, Complex Analysis in the math review on pg. 4, and the personal projects on pg. 6-7 honestly are way over my head. Meanwhile, the microwave engineering/optics program is [here](http://www.erasmus-master.emimeo.eu/program-details/), and while I'm much more confident about self-studying for this one, I'm left wondering if I'd be chickening out due to fear by committing to this one over the photonics program.

I read the rules and this isn't a homework problem, nor would I label it unscientific, but I totally understand if you remove this. I have a science/beauracracy question that I think someone here may be able to help with or at least point me in the right direction. 

I am writing a screenplay about time travelers who are travelling from the year 2050 to kill their dictator in the year 2019 when she was a college student. No, there is no cyborg or Terminators involved. The time machine causes severe memory loss and most of the script is them trying to remember their identities and objective. The time travelers work at NASA and are building their time machine there under false pretenses. 

Anyway, right as one of the time travelers are being sent back, they are figured out and FBI agents are sent to capture them. The dictatorship doesn’t want any information of the time machine to leak, so as they make the arrests, they close off the building being used for the experiments under the pretense of some potentially dangerous accident happening (maybe a gas leak or something?)
 
What would be a good scientific reason for the FBI to give for the area to need to be cleared? Also, I realize that it would probably be another government body as opposed to the FBI who would deal with such a fake threat. But by my sci-fi movie logic, the FBI would be needed to capture the scientists and interrogate them and they would probably pretend to be with another government agency. (Remember the US is now a dictatorship, they can do pretty much whatever) in order to make their gas leak story more credible to the public. What would the appropriate government agency be? 

I am super super grateful of any help you may provide me. :)",1,2020-04-21 21:31:13,physics

Abstract:
&gt; I shall sketch the contents of Noether's 1918 article, ""Invariante Variationsprobleme"", in the context of the debate on the conservation of energy that had arisen from Einstein's general theory of relativity. How original was Noether's ""Invariante Variationsprobleme""? how modern were her use of Lie groups and her introduction of generalized vector fields? and how influential was her article? I shall sketch the curious transmission of her results from 1918 to 1970, the history of the later developments of her theory in mathematics and in physics, and the ultimate recognition of the wide applicability of ""the Noether theorems"".

The paper also counters some of the myths and misconceptions about Nother and her theorems that persist in the community.

However, if there is an academic type tool I coud use just to learn some of the more basic concepts involving phyiscs I would be very happy to try that out.

I recently discovered my fascination with physics by listening/watching various podcasts and videos of famous physicists talk about their field. Two of my favorite physicists to listen to are Brian Cox and Sean Caroll. While their deeper and more advanced topics are what originally peaked my interest in learning more about physics, I would like to go all the way back to the very basics so I can better understand the theories and apply formulas to specific questions.

One of the things that fascinated me the most about physics, is how much it pertains to other fields of science since it is quite literally all about figuring out more about the universe we inhabit. Because of that, most of the physicists I've listened to are decently well versed in other areas of science, which is something I admire a lot.

I never had a very strong background in science or mathematics, so something that would be willing to ease me into it would be preferred. Despite my lack of expertise in those subjects, it continues to captivate me and inspires me to learn more about it on my own. Any input on things I can use to assist me with this endeavor will be greatly appreciated.

I'm asking this because I saw many graphs with pseudocritical pressure and reduced pressure on the x axis. I think this type of graph (z-p) can be also useful (especially at high school level physics) to visualize under which conditions air can be approximated well enough as an ideal gas. 

Some basic background:

* z (compressibility factor) can be added in the ideal gas law as follows:   pV = znRT
* Obviously if z equals 1 the approximation is perfect.

With that in mind it can be seen from the graph that air can be well treated as an ideal gas at lower pressures and higher temperatures.

I'm well aware that the question I'm asking could easily be misinterpreted as such at a glance, but I'm actually trying to find out if there's real-world models or simulations that have been done on the topic of high-mass relativistic projectiles as I'm trying to evaluate what kind of effect a future-tech weapon might have in order to keep my sci-fi more on the ""sci"" end of the scale.

At any rate, my question is regarding the physics of a relativistic projectile (say, a 15kg shell strolling along at about 0.24*c*) and what kind of effects something like that might have on a reasonably solid body like a planet or an object that is a mixture of gaseous contents and solid material (such as a large spacefaring vessel).  I haven't been able to track down anything discussing the effect of a high-mass object colliding with another object or its effects on a non-vacuum medium aside from an xkcd post, and for obvious reasons this hasn't been tested or documented in a real-world environment.  However, I am curious if there's any models or simulations that have been run by physicists that might help in answering if such a projectile would essentially: 

* be leaving behind a thermonuclear ""sonic boom"" in its wake on hitting a planet its atmosphere, or;
* zip through it so fast that the atmospheric and planetary/ship molecules in the way are smashed into the leading edge of the projectile so fast they don't interact with the surrounding medium at all

If there is such a model or simulation I would greatly appreciate it if you can point me in the right direction (and maybe help understand it if it's more or less pure math as I'm admittedly not a physicist myself).",0,2020-04-19 20:49:31,physics

6624,g4fjid,How can quantum randomness result in free will? Please explain??,"Hi, I am very new to this (the active reddit platform and advanced scientific academia in general), and so I must begin by asking that you please excuse me for any uneducated assumptions and/or improper terminology, and ban/punish me as necessary if I am breaking any rules! Further, if I am asking this question in the wrong place, please refer me to the appropriate sub. Otherwise, please be gentle. 

I have a real fascination with theoretical physics, primarily as a result of my studies in metaphysics (I am a philosophy major - I guess for some of you this would be the point where you stop reading), however am incredibly bad at mathematics. This is really annoying because I long to be able to comprehend complex theories of physics in their purest form, as opposed to just being amazed by their implications (yes, even the 'boring' ones! Not just fashionable concepts like multi-verse propositions in pop-culture etc.), but my brain simply cannot effectively grasp the language of science at the level required to study science. 

Anyway, in philosophical terms, the concept of determinism and human free will (or lack thereof) tends to be a straightforward and convincing argument (i.e. cause and effect; starting conditions determine all subsequent events; and the fact that biology/environment are the only two scientifically accepted factors that make a human being who/what they are, who/what they are determines what decisions they make, etc.,: thus no genuine freedom of choice). However, I was recently talking to a physics major about quantum randomness, and how, on such micro levels, things tend to behave with indeterminacy. Again, I don't completely understand the technical science behind this, but what threw me the most was his, quite confusing (probably my bad, not his), argument that this randomness on such a fundamental level somehow proved a human capacity for free will. 

Now, sceptically (and considering my ignorance and profound lack of scientific insight), I feel I cannot rule out the possibility of 'hidden variables' that cause these apparent act of randomness. But even if I were to rashly concede that this is a true instance of randomness that would have a macro effect on our behaviour, would this still not reject free will? It would seem, then, that either everything is predetermined by prior factors/conditions that we do not control (i.e. determinism); everything is random and the universe operates wholly chaotically; or, perhaps, a combination of the two? Regardless, any way I look at it, I cannot see how or where free will could possibly exist?

I recognise that I appear very uneducated by asking this question in such a community, and I do apologise. I wanted to pose this question to those who have a firm grasp of quantum mechanics (i.e. well versed enough to respectfully inform a neutral, uneducated audience), as well as perhaps a proclivity towards the philosophical implications of the Pure Sciences; in particular, of this quantum indeterminacy and how it relates to freedom. Having said that, any corrections or further explanations regarding quantum mechanics (and/or physics in general) and how it could possibly allow for human free will, would be greatly appreciated.

6628,g4dd0s,Are these so-called approximations really approximate?,"I recently came across some commonly used methods in physics that employ a very old technique (discarding higher order 'small' terms) so as to derive equations, usually to study how things behave 'locally'. One is [linear approximations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_approximation), another is the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) (the trick is used in its derivation), and another is [Taylor series approximations](http://webhome.phy.duke.edu/~hsg/415/taylor-series-tutorial.pdf). These methods seem to used all over the place in physics and are related to the [calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations) and [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory). Note that in the former case this approach is explicitly part of calculus. My question is: since these methods all use the same trick (discarding higher order incremental terms) aren't they all a part of calculus? Remember that 'neglecting' higher order infinitesimals was a well used technique in calculus until academia (i.e. the mathematicians) mostly turned against it in the early twentieth century. Also, note that in the various methods shown here the discarded term is being made indefinitely small, which is exactly how infinitesimals are supposed to behave - since the seventeenth century some mathematicians (e.g. [Lazare Carnot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazare_Carnot)) have been explicit about this. This is a problem because the word 'approximation' *should* be reserved for when we can actually put a value on it e.g. margins of error, engineering tolerance etc. So isn't 'approximation' a badly misleading way of describing these basic physical methods?",3,2020-04-19 14:07:17,physics

My background is astrophysics and Solar System research. After a few  years studying and working in the scientific community I changed to the  automotive industry with financial related topics; however I still work  on science related topics in my free time.

I  the last couple of years I got some very specific, space science  related Python skills, after I worked for the Philae Lander (Rosetta  mission to the comet 67P) and on a cosmic dust measuring device mounted  on the Cassini spacecraft (mission to Saturn). I did... well... science.  E.g., I used machine learning algorithms to handle and analyse the  data. I did Monte-Carlo simulations (also with Python), public outreach  material, my doctorate studies and so on. To give you an overview, I am  the first author of a meteor camera analysis paper, where the analysis  and almost all plots have been done with Python:

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349)

Anyway, why am I here? I would like to ask you, the community, if something like a ""Medium Article series"" or something similar would be interesting  for you to work on space related data and topics with Python?

I would like to share my knowledge and would like to show you for example:

* How to compute simple trajectories of spacecraft missions
* How to compute positions and orbits of asteroids, planets, etc.
* How  to determine the position of objects in the sky (+ brightness  computations, visibility on different geographic coordinates, etc.)
* How to ""answer"" space science related questions (so a series, where the content of a paper is being reproduced)
* Simple animations (like this attempt, I worked on a few years ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ))

Again: everything would be done in Python, and the corresponding scripts and tutorials would also be shared on Github. Executing the code could be done on Google Colaboratory.

Please let me know, what you think. Whether this tutorial idea has some potential or not. Please share your comments and also ideas or criticism. I would like to get some resonance and I also published a small introduction without any programming part yet, to build of a ""proper thread"" on Medium.

I am working on a modelling problem and I need it to test my results.

I guess I can't suppose the calory needed to burn something is the calory of the thing right? I would be looking for the activation energy needed (ignition) ?

But I can suppose total and immediate combustion. Under that hypothesis, could I conclude the calories are equal?

How does that work? I am a math student and I am rarely working on applied problem... 

Could I look up the fusion point of every component and  compute a ponderate average and then use idk newton cooling law or another of your equation? I am lost.

6697,g3pori,The debate on the need for the observer in quantum physics to be conscious or not?,"I understand that most scientists don't consider consciousness to be a necessary characteristic of the observer in quantum physics, that it's all simply a matter of physical interaction with the system, e.g. in theories of quantum decoherence. And many are downright contemptuous of the idea, attributing it to fringe new age views, etc.

But I also know that some minority of scientists think consciousness is an irreducible part of the equation -- e.g. the views represented by [Henry Stapp and colleagues](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/coming-to-grips-with-the-implications-of-quantum-mechanics/).

Does anyone have a really good, fair summary -- either in their own words, or links to articles -- of the back-and-forth with respect to the overall body of experimental evidence?

Some random points that I'd also appreciate anyone addressing, if they want:

-In the double slit experiment, if it is merely physical interference that collapses the wave function, why don't the slits themselves act as detectors and collapse it?
 
-How could you ever show that a wave function collapsed without an observer to note that? isn't the presence of an observer always confounded with that information?

-Don't the quantum erasure experiments show that the mere presence of a detector doesn't collapse the wave form?",15,2020-04-18 10:51:56,physics
6698,g3po7i,quantum collapse,"Quantum Theory I, 2nd-year physics BSc -

the professor mentions a phenomenon called quantum ""collapse"". as I've understood it, the action of measuring the system is in itself the one who determines the outcome of said system. The measurement is a method of data transformation from a system that is purely quantum(and has just a few degrees of freedom, if any), to a system with many degrees of freedom, going in the process through systems with more and more degrees of freedom. the ""collapse"" occurs somewhere in the process. WHERE? what determines the border?

on another subject- the superposition of the system (aka both dead and alive) seems rather obscure. how I see it - the cat is dead OR alive, rather than dead AND alive. it is just me, the viewer, who isn't familiar with the accurate details of the system.

My problem with this course is not the theory: the professor theaches very well, but the exercises and the examples. Every example and exercises I do, I approache it in the wrong way, there are always some tricks which I cannot recognize and are not very logical.

They also learn about special relativity. These two combines into one of my favourite facts ever: an electrical conductor with a current moving through it becomes electrically charged if it moves along its own length. As a high school science teacher, this seems like it could be a fun demonstration.

Is there any feasible way to demonstrate this in a classroom? I was thinking about winding a wire around a drum that can rotate, send directed current through it, and have it push / pull on something charged but stationary, like a  Van de Graaf generator or a feather. This would demonstrate that just current won't do anything, just spinning the drum won't do anything, but spinning the drum and turning on the current will push / pull on the charged object.

There are many things I can do to make the effect stronger. I can wind the wire many times around the drum, I can spin the drum quickly, I can pass a lot of current through the wire, I can have an object with low mass and a lot of charge. How far do I have to push these to make the effect noticeable? Can it be done safely in a classroom?",3,2020-04-18 03:50:31,physics

I have taken a couple of introductory lab based courses, although I did not particularly enjoy them. 

My default plan was to just continue in the CMT track in grad school. But this quarantine got me thinking about the future, and I realised that I have a greater affinity to stay long term in academia, than to die on the theory hill.

Should I be worried about my lack of lab experience?

And for clarification, lets say the bullet before fired is 7 grams (0.24 ounces) and a calliber of .31 and the bullet after leaving the barrel is 70 grams (2.4 ounces) and a caliber of 3.1.  I'm just multiplying the weight by ten as the size is multiplied by 10.

We'll keep earths gravity and say there is no air resistance.

Questions: How far would the bullet go? What would the impact on a person look like if they were about 30 feet away? What happens to the bullet in general?

Edit: After some research, I found that an average bullet from a pepperbox travels at just about 700 feet per second.  It would start at 700 feet/second and end at 70 feet/second. So after a 7 gram bullet being fired at 700 feet per second being transformed into a 70 gram bullet. What would the result be now? What does that transition look like?

If two objects with mass, actual mass is irrelevant, are placed an infinite distance apart from each other, after an infinite amount of time passes, the two objects would inevitably collide. This hypothetical situation doesn't have dark energy pushing the two objects away from each other.

Now my question is this, if it's a perfect void aside from those two objects, and they are an infinite distance away, wouldn't they keep accelerating towards each other, and at some point in their journey, wouldn't they surpass the speed of light? Also if they did, wouldn't that mean their mass would also be infinite? Two objects of infinite mass colliding with each other at the speed of light or ""faster"" would technically create more matter wouldn't it?

6993,g0rpks,"""A Guide to Physics Problems"" challenge","Hi everyone,

Thanks to the lockdown, I got some extra time on my hand, which I wanted to use for polishing my physics knowledge and problem solving skills (I did my undergrad in Physics but doing PhD in something that's not really hardcore physics). For that purpose, I set myself the challenge of solving ideally 1-2 problems per day from ""A Guide to Physics Problems"" book of Cahn and Nadgorny. I was just wondering if anyone is interested in joining along for brainstorming and discussions on the problems. I don't have any platform to host this but if you are interested you can comment or private message me, and we can keep in touch!

This competition is entirely online and simpler to qualify for the international level. It’s open to individuals both above and below 18 and operates in 3 rounds: the qualifying round, pre-final round, and finals. 

The first two are all open-ended, with the pre-final round also having two research questions (where you read a scientific paper and answer the question). 

The deadline to participate in the first round is May 15th. The pre-final round is completed in a 1 week period after that, and the final is a 60-min MCQ test.

And yes, there are prizes!

7103,fz8ibt,Help Me Understand Canonical Transformations and Hamilton-Jacobi Theory,"I'm trying to teach myself canonical transformations, Hamilton-Jacobi theory, and action-angle variables. I took a physics graduate course is analytical mechanics but we skipped all of this material. 

I've been using ""Classical Mechanics"" by Goldstein, Poole, and Safko. I'm pretty confused about it all right now. I'm following most of the math I think, but I don't really see the point of the utility of all of it yet. Goldstein has very few examples showing this material ""in action"". I also have ""The Variational Principles of Mechanics"" by Lanczos. I've looked at that one a little bit also.

Can anyone recommend sources that show how canonical transformations are used and why we should be interested in them? I need even more help with HJ theory and action-angle variables. Goldstein includes the Kepler problem as an example, but it's not done in a very systematic or elucidating way. It seems like a bunch of random relations and steps that somehow come together at the end to give you ..... I don't even know. 

All the sources I've seen so far only consider conservative systems with time-independent Hamiltonians. Ultimately, I'm trying to expand all of this material to systems with arbitrary control inputs and then apply it to optimal control theory.  I'm not ready for that yet though. I still don't fully understand this material within the context I just outlined. 

Here is what I would like help with:

1.) can anyone tell me the main advantage/motivation/uses for:  (A) canonical transformations and, (B) The HJ equations and action-angle variables. 

2.) Any info or good sources that include a systematic approach of applying all of this material AND provide clear examples. 

NOTE: I have a BS in physics but am currently in grad school in engineering. Please keep any info/sources to the realm of classical mechanics.  It's been way too long since I've done any quantum, E&amp;M, or GR : (.  Also, my math skills are mostly limited to calculus (including calculus of variations) and linear algebra.

Imagine a very long rope, like one light-hour long or so, hanged in a homogeneous field. Imagine a person climbing the rope from the free tail end. The human makes a force (tension) in the rope in order to keep on climbing. What happens if we cut the rope in the tail where it is tied? Is the human able to keep on climbing for more than an hour? What happens to the force that he makes? Will he ""float"" in the air during the time that ""information"" should arrive? I mean, I know he cannot notice it until an hour later at least, but it is a situation so rare to me: to scale a rope that is not fixed, that is floating.

1. Mass causes gravitational attraction. 

2. The Universe is expanding at an exponential rate.

3. Dark Energy and Matter has not been proven as the culprit.

4. Most of the necessary mass that 'should' exist in the Universe is missing.

&amp;#x200B;

Possible Theory

1. There is one or more greater gravitational mass outside the visible Universe within what is known as the Meta-universe/multiverse.

2. The 'missing' mass is lurking outside of the observable Universe this could possibly be what is causing causing the acceleration of the mass within the observable Universe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Possible Proof

1. Accurately measure the speed of galaxies at the edge of our Universe to check for discrepancies of the velocities of galaxies.

I'm definitely going to be picking up some compsci classes, probably focusing on C++ and C#; if there are any other languages that would be more useful, please let me know! 

I'm also looking into getting Boulder's quantitative finance certificate and I was wondering if anyone has any experience with that or if it opens any doors. I know Colorado is pretty dry for investment banking/private equity/finance in general but I can live anywhere in the world. I'm fluent in English and Korean, proficient in Spanish, and reasonably okay at Russian, if there are any good options in any countries that use those languages (I would love to be a risk analyst in a gulag!)

I want to get a physics PhD and through that, look into quant work or working at a tech company as a software engineer or analyst. Are there any other physics-heavy jobs that I should look into and consider? I'm pretty averse to applied physics which is why I'm not even considering engineering, but I'm open to anything else that's math/physics heavy. I'm not great at computer science, nor am I particularly enthralled by it, but I'm very willing to learn and get better.

7174,fyhvai,"When did you realise Newton gravity is problematic, if you have done?","If you know a bit about about the history of physics you will be aware that the reception of Newton's theory of universal gravitation was not accepted on the continent for some decades. The problem was that he provided no mechanism for gravitational influence, only a description

This seems to me to be a really important thing to teach, because of the major controversies between more traditional natural philosophical approaches and the novel phenomenalism of the Royal Society it is perhaps the most straightforward to grasp, and it demonstrates remarkably two very different explanatory strategies in physics: one (which rejected Newton gravity) that is focused on mechanisms at the microstructure, and another (which Newton was employing) that remains agnostic about the microstructure but provides an account of the phenomena. If we want to understand what physics is understanding 

Furthermore, the doubts really were quite well grounded; Newton was aware of the problem and tried in vain to find a mechanism for gravitational influence. Indeed, it cannot be resolved within the Newtonian framework: demanding that physics be local leads to general relativity. 

I'm interested to know what kind of appreciation there is of this problem of Newtonian gravity, and if it is often present before people learn GR and QFT, where the problems with action-at-a-distance become more obvious.

If you don't mind, please answer the poll in terms of your awareness of this problem, and whether you have studied some GR/QFT or not.

Thanks!

I even got 96/100 in my school exams. However, after joining my college, I have often found, and have been told that my foundation is weak. I have difficulties explaining(or understanding) even the basic concepts of stuff I have studied, like application (or even understanding) of Newton's laws, working of transistors, concepts of vectors, etc. In college, I have studied Mechanics, Special Relativity, Electrodynamics, Waves,  Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, Thermal Physics and a few courses on Mathematical Physics, Computational Physics, and Electronics.

However,  I still find major gaps in my knowledge. I wanted to ask how can I fill these gaps. In getting marks I might be better than most students, but I believe my actual understanding of the material is the same as someone who is just starting to learn about introduction to Newtonian mechanics in school.

7199,fy7vaj,How does beamforming actually work?,"Hello. I’ve done a lot of research on this subject. I’ve googled so much that my brain is about to explode.



No matter where I search, I cannot seem to find any information on how beamforming truly works. I get that it uses constructive and destructive interference to add the waves together and precisely direct them. But I cannot find out exactly how this actually works or what it truly means.


Here’s the thing: Photons supposedly don’t interfere with each other. Yet I’m also reading that they can interfere with themselves, yet nobody offers a clear explanation on what this truly means or how it works. If anyone has offered an actual answer anywhere online, it must be super complex with college graduate equations. 


So what I’m wondering is: 


1) How can em waves add(constructive interference) or cancel(destructive interference) with each other other on a quantum level? “White” light can go through a crystal and separate colors. This must mean that different frequency photons didn’t interfere with each other in the same space. I have heard they must be a similar frequency and perfectly out of phase. Yet I still don’t fully understand if it’s as simple as the electric field of one photon cancelling the magnetic field of a different photon...because if this is the case, how would a cancelled magnetic field induce an electric field?..wouldn’t this mean that it was only a half cycle? 

This confuses me more with beamforming, which brings me to me second set of questions:


2) How does beamforming direct the electromagnetic energy of waves that cancel with each other? Does this mean that the energy has a higher frequency such that the wavelength is so small that it would appear like a beam? What exactly is happening here? How could the direction even change by canceling the waves? Obviously energy can’t be created or destroyed. So if 2 photons cancel each other 100%, does this mean that the energy is radiated and creates a new photon? This is so confusing to me. 





I truly would appreciate any detailed and helpful answers, preferably in plain English.(no equations or complicated terms) I have truly tried to google and research this. So I hope you guys can help me.


I’m sorry if my questions seem unorganized or unclear. Please feel free to ask me to clarify any more details about a particular question.

Mass is ordered energy. We are energy in a fabric of energy.

I did chemical Engineering, the big problem with Fusion is keeping the plasma stable in the glass reactor. I did fluid and thermodynamics, but to keep a plasma stable the magnetic field is used to keep the reaction continuous and undisturbed... But is currently unsustainable..

In the equations we see density as mass per volume. But i think we should integrate volume in the equations. We live in one dimension, energy across time.

But i raise the point. Height width and depth are our limited perception of being inside a one dimensional energy fabric.

People are the chaos, animals are chaos just like any energy moving or transferring is often chaotic, life is chaotic, people are.

In that case we live in one dimension. Energy as a state of chaos or order in time, just like any chemical reaction tries to find balance and a more stable state of being.

I put it to you, the point in life is to achieve balance.

What I don't understand is what these oscillation modes mean physically. I have come across damped pressure modes which I believe exist moreso in the outer envelope of a star, and I have also come across coherent gravity modes which exist in convective star cores. And I understand the frequencies of these modes can be measured, however what is the frequency that is measured? Do these oscillation modes change the amount of light released from a star, do they shift the wavelength of light from the star?

A particle of mass m is in the first excited eigenstate of the 1D infinite square well potential where the size of the well is a. At t = 0, the external potential suddenly (instantaneously) changes to a harmonic oscillator with x0 = a.

(b) Write down the normalized wave function of the particle for t &lt; 0.

7256,fxlca8,Do We Exist At The Singularity Of A White Hole?,"It's a currently accepted theory that time and space essentially switch axes at the singularity of a black hole. This means time becomes spacelike (seemingly omnidirectional) and traversable whereas any direction in space is linear by only leading further into the singularity. 

If white holes are the inversed counterparts of black holes, then at the singularity of a white hole space becomes omnidirectional and traversable whereas time becomes linear by only leading further away from the singularity.  

&amp;#x200B;

From this description, it seems that a white hole singularity should exhibit properties in line with our observable reality (i.e. you can move around in space but time advances away from the point of origin).  It may then be possible that our universe was created by a white hole (the Big Bang) forcing any direction in spacetime away from that singularity. If this seems far fetched and outlandish, suspend your disbelief for one moment and try to see what this would imply. The big idea that tops the list is the implication of dark energy.

Without dark energy accelerating the expansion of space in a white hole singularity, all of the matter in the singularity would recollapse upon itself by the effects of gravity. Impossible, reconvergence of the singularity breaks the very definition of a white hole. Dark energy would then be implied as a property of the space inside a white hole singularity preventing that impossible path of reconvergence.  

When we look at the state of our observable universe, dark energy is the only thing standing between us and the theorized Big Crunch. The Big Crunch is a reconvergence of all matter creating a second universal singularity which implies a new Big Bang restarting the universe from day 0. In a white hole singularity, since all paths in spacetime lead away from the singularity, it would be the very nature of that space to expand at an accelerated rate preventing all the matter from reconverging (opposite of what happens in a black hole singularity). 

\*\*This might also imply that inside the singularity of a black hole there is corresponding dark energy accelerating the space together\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Please let me know your thoughts. Criticism very welcomed. I claim this post doesn't break the unscientific pet theory rule since I'm merely piecing together large theories like a jigsaw. If these larger theories (i.e. Big Bang, black holes, white holes, dark energy, etc..) are valid then I'm merely connecting the bigger dots.

Here are some related links:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_EWCN3CPhTI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EWCN3CPhTI) \- Weinstein on the Joe Rogan Podcast.

I personally find it to be an interesting approach. He gave the following example on the Joe Rogan Podcast:

We can observe that the Universe has a ""preference"" in terms of left and right spin. There are numerous examples of this in different fields of od research. It pops up in the Higgs with electrons. Also when radioactive elements decay.

We struggle to understand this asymmetry as it really makes little sense. Weinstein gave the example of looking at your left hand. It looks asymmetric like the Universe we observe. But if you look at both of your hands they are symmetric. And as we know that nature tends to be symmetric, Weinstein proposes that there are other parts of the Universe where this symmetry is completed in relation to ""our"" part of the Universe.

In these ""other"" parts the electron with the opposite spin would have this property in the Higgs field and so on.

I have a few questions:

In the diagram above, (L1, L2, L3) represent angular momentum in 3 orthonormal basis vector x, y, z. and (w1, w2, w3)  represent angular velocity in 3 orthonormal basis vectors x,y,z respectively. I dont understand why the inertia tensor is called a tensor even though its just an ordinary 3 by 3 matrix? Isn't a tensor a mathematical object wherein matrices of m by n dimensions are stacked on top of each other? the entries Ixx, Ixy, and the rest of the entries in the inertia ""tensor"" are just numerical values, not column vectors. Therefore, why is this matrix called an inertia tensor?

Second of all, I want to ask about Ixy. If Ixx represents moment inertia about the x axis, and Iyy represents moment inertia about the y-axis. What does Ixy represent? Moment inertia of object about xy axis? is xy axis an axis in the xy plane poition angled 45 degrees from either x or y axis? Also, what is the proof that integ(xy) shows integral around xy axis?

So after lots of browsing around on reddit, uni program descriptions, course lists, etc. I think I've brought it down to engineering, physics, and math and I was wondering what your opinions were between these 3 (fyi, double major isn't an option at the universities here that I want to go too).

Just some background that may be helpful: since like forever I've always been fascinated by machines - I used to draw planes in elementary school and since middle school I've been making random electronic things (like a little solar-powered desk bladeless fan). Based on this, I feel like engineering may be the right choice because of its hands-on nature, but at the same time math is hands down my first ""true"" passion, as cheesy as it sounds. As a kid I was really introverted (still am) so one day decided to check out Khan Academy and I got addicted to it lol. Been doing math ever since (contests, uni lecture notes, etc). A part of me loves the idea of just sitting down for hours at a time working through things like curl or series. BUT, when I was introduced to physics in gr9 (circuits) I was again just... mesmerized. Just the idea of electrons in a wire or why gravity's equation is the way it is, etc.

Now, this is getting long, but here's some unrelated info: even though I'm extremely introverted as a ""person"", that's not the case with group projects etc. Another thing regarding math - I need the proof or at least intuition of formulas (ex. if you plop cosine law in front of me for the first time I just ""must"" try to find a proof/search it up if I can't), but at the same time I'm not sure if very abstract stuff is my thing (like sets). Finally, I know people say follow your passion but truth is, I want to make a decent amount of money mostly just to give back to my parents and because of their struggles - they were first generation immigrants (btw they don't care what I do as long as I have a stable job in the end). P.S. (sorry!) I have very high 90s in STEM courses so I think all 3 fields are pretty open to me.

During my Quantum Mechanics course last semester I was assigned a homework problem that some of you might remember too. It was problem 4.20 in Griffith's Quantum Mechanics ed.3, and here it is: https://imgur.com/nJSgllj.png

Essentially what the problem is asking the reader to do is to use the potential energy function for an electron in a hydrogen atom and to replace the electron mass with the earth mass. Through that, if we find earth's quantum number *n* and then drop it one energy level, the wavelength of the photon that would be emitted ends up having a wavelength of almost exactly 1 light year. Then, the question asks for your opinion of if it's a coincidence or not.

What jogged my memory was this fact that was shared to me.

""Portland, Maine's latitude is approximately 43 degrees north and so the celestial equator passes 90 - 43 = 47 degrees above due south.""  


I remember I had been curious where exactly the sun may have sat in the sky, relative to my position in Portland, Maine between 2 and 3 PM on October 4th, 2019.  


The reason being I had this strange little experience at that time!

I was lying on a bench, and placing my cell phone above my face so that it blotted out the sun. When I positioned the cell phone horizontally (about 5 inches long by 2 inches wide) to my face, and moved it closer to my face, naturally the phone got bigger and blotted out a little more and more of my vision. When rested against my nose, the horizontal phone is long enough to partially cover both my eyes and appear as a solid gray slab in the middle of my vision, with a ring around it where I see past. (If I remember right, the phone was horizontal, if it had actually been vertical, then it would have run up my face, basically covering my nose and perhaps a little bit of each eye, so that my eyes see past the phone but there is a sort of 'ghost' image of the phone.'

What I noticed was when I blotted out the sun with my phone at arms length, it appeared as if bright light, the suns rays, were shining from the outskirts of the phone. As I brought the phone closer to my face, the rays of light extended closer to the center of the phone. But what happened next really surprised me, and I tried for some time without success to replicate. By the time the phone was resting against my nose, it still appeared that rays of light were emitting out of the middle of the phone, but at the exact center, there appeared a black circle. The black circle appeared a similar size as the sun itself, and reminded me very much of the solar eclipse that I saw a few years back. It was just very odd, and odd that I hadn't been able to replicate. I realize there is probably a lot going on that I do not understand with light, and with the way my eyes work, but I just found it very interesting.

It appeared as if I fabricated a solar eclipse by blotting out the sun with my phone. Any thoughts?

I mean, I get that this is responsible for the Doppler effect, etc, but why do the waves actually *compress*? Is it because the observer sort of hears a layered effect of simultaneously hearing a more outer-ring sound wave that the object gave out when it was farther away, on top of more inner-ring sound waves as the object moved closer?

If that was the case, wouldn’t that indicate that as a sound wave moves out from an object (moves from being a more “inner ring” sound wave to being a more “outer ring” sound wave), the pitch drops? Ie. Taking two unmoving observers and an unmoving sound source, the further away observer would hear the sound as a lower pitch. But that’s not the case, from what I understand. For still sources and observers, only the volume will drop if the observer is further away, not the pitch. So I don’t see how “layering” sound waves of identical pitch could be responsible for the compression.

So how do sound waves ACTUALLY become compressed, or is it just something we know that they do?

So, my quantum mechanics professor told us that we could get extra credit for the final grade if we could come up with a good paper about something related to the course that would be accepted at least for revision (that means, it doesn't have to get published) on ANY physics journal (it could even be a really local journal. Nothing fancy). He said, for instance, it could be something ""simple"" on a physics education journal.

As right now we are somewhat low on assignments because of the quarantine, I am thinking of giving it a try. As I haven't written a paper before, I am looking for some inspiration or anything that could help me come up with something (I know there isn't a recipe for writing papers, really just looking for anything that could help). For example: how can I know if my idea is worth putting into a paper?

So far, the course (quantum mechanics 2) has covered:

* time independent perturbation theory (we spent a lot of time on hydrogen's fine structure)
* time dependent perturbation theory
* scattering
* we are now looking into identical particles (though I am a little familiar with it because of statistical physics).

And based on the topics and my personal preferences, my ideas so far are:

* I really liked Lamb's microwave experiment to observe hydrogen's fine structure. I enjoyed reading that paper and the physics behind it were relatively simple, but I can't find detailed derivations on the math to describe it. I thought it would be cool to write this for a physics education journal. My approach would be (for anyone familiar with the experiment): treat microwave radiation with time dependent perturbation theory and describe the output's current with photoelectric effect (which is also time dependent perturbation theory)
* Apply perturbation theory and scattering to an ""exotic"" potential. For example, an Axilrod-Teller potential (I haven't thought this idea much, so I don't have more details in mind).

Any hints would be appreciated.",2,2020-04-07 01:22:00,physics

𝑏𝑦 𝐽𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑦 𝐻𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑠

Please just try to clear your mind of all preconceptions of what you were taught or currently think time to be. EVERYTHING you need to know about what time actually is and what it is NOT will be explained clearly in my following comments. Please read ALL of it with an open mind and a willingness to understand time in a different way than you did before.

You must first be sure that you having a proper understanding of what time actually is and what it is not before you begin trying to interpret theories such as the theories of special and general relativity.  Because when you apply a misunderstanding of time to your interpretation of such theories, you are bound to make some conclusions that are not true.

Einstein made a great achievement with the concept of an elastic aether he called ""space-time"" that explains the cause of gravity. But, I believe he also set back science over a hundred years in properly understanding time.  I have great confidence that a day will come when scientists will look back and laugh at how ridiculous the theory of ""relative time"" and ""time dilation"" was, and how stupid people were to actually believe it was true.

Time has no rate, it has no speed, it has no ""flow"", it has no direction, it is not a dimension, it is not a distance, it does not progress, and it is not a requirement for motion and change to occur. Clock rate retardation is not the same thing as ""time dilation"". Relative motion is not the same thing as ""relative time"", and relative motion is the only thing that clocks can ""measure"" (compare). Time equals time, and space equals space, and those two things do not equal each other. You never travel ""through time"", you only move across points in space.

Saying that ""time slows down"", is a phrase that makes no sense and has no meaning. It is tantamount to saying that temperature could slow down, that a gallon could slow down, or that a mile could slow down. It doesn't make sense, because you are describing a change in a property for those concepts that those concepts do not possess nor represent in the first place. You can't change the temperature of a gallon, because a gallon has no temperature to change, and you can't change the speed of time because time has no speed to change.

Time is not the same thing as chronology either. Chronology is the true order and progression of motion and change that is objective and has nothing do with whether you observed it or not.

It never IS a time, it only ever is a moment in chronology, or a moment in the progression of change and motion. Past, present, and future are adjectives that describe the placement of moments in chronology, not their placement in time.

Time is NOT the ""arrow for entropy"" or vice versa. It is CHRONOLOGY that is that arrow. This is because chronology and entropy are things that progress and have a direction. Time does not progress and has no direction. It doesn't make sense to think that a period of unobserved progression can be something that is progressing itself. A period in the PAST cannot change.

Entropy is the irreversible elimination of possibilities for a system, that is brought about by the progression of change and motion, not by some invisible boogeyman named time. It is not time that ages you or that causes systems to deteriorate. It is spatial motion of objects, interaction with other objects, and internal changes caused by spatial motion and interaction with other objects that causes aging and deterioration.

I am not saying that clocks do not serve a practical purpose. They do. They help us remain in sync with the rotation of the Earth, with the day, the night, and with each other. But their purpose is not to measure or represent time. I will further elaborate on the differences between time and what clocks ""measure"" in another article I will post named, ""Clocks Do Not 'Measure' What You Think They Do.""

Time is something different.

The reason for past confusion regarding time is there has been no clarity between terms, and people have tried to use the word time to describe too many different things. You can't make time be synonymous with clock rate, synonymous with motion and change, and also synonymous with chronology, because those things contradict each other. Time is not a synonym for any of those things. Time should have no synonyms. There should be no other word that describes what time describes.

So here is a list of clear terms...

Clock rate = The comparison of the motion of the hands on a clock to the motion of another object during the same period of progression.

Chronology = The true order or progression of the change and motion of objects, that is completely objective and doesn't matter if it was observed or not.

Time = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, and you missed out on observing.

History = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, that you were present to observe and document.

Chronology is the OBJECTIVE progression of events that does not depend on your observation as part of its definition. But time and history DO depend on your observation or lack thereof in order to define which one is which.

Time must be extrapolated, but history must not, because history was observed and time was not. So you could think of time as being the opposite of history.

You must understand that there can be two different kinds of time. There is individual time from the perspective of one observer, and there is collaborative time where multiple observers work together to compare notes or combine observations. This means there would be a personal history and a collaborative history.

So from the perspective of an observer in the US, the events that happened in China that he missed out on observing himself would be his individual time. But when the guy from China comes and tells him what happened in China while he was observing the US, and the guy from the US returns the favor, they have now eliminated some time by collaborating and making a collective history.

So, collaborative time will always be less than individual time, and collaborative documentation of chronology (collaborative history) will always be more documentation than individual documentation (individual history). You can only document what is KNOWN because it was OBSERVED. Extrapolation is not documentation.

If you could observe the progression everywhere and for everything in the universe simultaneously, then time would literally not exist FOR YOU. Because nothing would be missed by your observation, and everything would be documented history instead.

Time does not determine where and when change or motion can occur, or how fast or slow that change and motion can occur. It doesn't ""take time"" for an object to move from point A to point Z. That motion only requires a physical cause and progression of that motion through all points between A and Z.

Time is just a gap in your observation of the progression of change and motion that occurred in between two known (observed) moments in that progression.

Once mankind understands this, we will all then realize that our common goal should be to work together combining our observations to eliminate the enemy of knowledge, that is time.",4,2020-04-06 22:00:03,physics

7402,fw0767,Question about bullets within different inertialsystems,"Hey guys, got a quick question here.
If i had a Jet who moves with a speed of 1km/s (for simplicity)
and it fires a bullet with 1km/s, the projectile does have the velocity of 2km/s now right? (relative to the earth)


So if i were to shoot a wall with that bullet, once while moving and once while standing still, does it have 4 times the kinetic energy on impact while on my jet, since its the velocity²?

Following that logic, wheres my ""logic"" error? The bullet already has kinetic Energy (lets say 200,000J) while on the Jet with 1km/s. And when its fired, does it gain 600,000 more Joule? Because relative to its own inertialsystem, it gained 200,000J.

And Follow-Up:

Would that mean that Weapons are more potent when being moved towards the (still standing) target? or less potent if moving away?

I am aware that 'drag' scales with v² as well, but i wanna leave that one out here. Im asking because im playing a modern tabletop game, and weapons are always labeled the same way and i was wondering.

7409,fvx0c3,Hydrogen Embrittlement,"I was recently considering _hydrogen embrittlement_  of metals, and particularly how it is that a hydrogen _atom_  introduced into the body of the metal by some chemical process occuring at the surface can migrate through it until it reaches a cavity, at which point it 'drops-out' into the cavity &amp; combines with another hydrogen atom to form H₂, in which form it can migrate no further; and this H₂ can build-up until colossal pressure is reached ... so high a pressure that the metal can become embrittled if there is a sufficient density of such cavities. (Or the hydrogen atom may combine with carbon to form CH₄, with similar result.)

But this looks a bit too much on the face of it like a 'Maxwell's Demon' kind of process: and I wonder how the thermodynamics of it pans-out: what is the maximum pressure that can be reached in a hypothetical rigid cavity; and if the cavity becomes deformed, then what proportion of the energy available to this process (which as far as I can tell can _only be_  from the formation of the H₂ or the CH₄ from the atomic hydrogen or atomic hydrogen + carbon) goes-into the mechanical work of making the cavity bigger &amp; what proportion is dissipated as heat.

Study:


Background:
The possibility of side effects associated with the electromagnetic waves emitted from mobile phones is a controversial issue. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone use on parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulin A, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase and C-reactive protein.
Methods:
Stimulated salivary samples were collected simultaneously from both parotid glands of 86 healthy volunteers. Salivary flow rate and salivary concentrations of proteins, amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin A, were measured. Data were analysed using t-tests and one-way analyses of variance.
Results:
Salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein were significantly higher on the right side compared to the left in those that predominantly held mobile phones on the right side. In addition, there was a decrease in concentrations of amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and peroxidase.
Conclusion:
The side of dominant mobile phone use was associated with differences in salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations, in right-dominant users. Although mobile phone use influenced salivary composition, the relationship was not significant.",1,2020-04-05 06:00:52,physics

7465,fv6uz9,In need of some advice for biophysics research in cardiology or immunology? Also getting better at math.,"I am currently debating how to better apply my math skills to work on research either in cardiology or immunology.

If I go to cardiology research route, then I can work in fluid dynamics or finite element analysis.

If I do virology, then I can do biophysics and differential geometry of viral assemblies.

Or I can do data science and work at applying machine learning for healthcare and genetics.

***Which route would you recommend and why? Also how can I get better at math?***

My background:

Bachelors in Biology with a thesis in Biophysics and Bioengineering of Cancer cells. I ended up with 1 published paper. I did go to an undergrad engineering school, but they didn't have bioengineering as an bachelors. I still had to take a lot of math and physics.

My weakness from undergrad is my chemistry skills. Even though I had 9 chemistry classes (2 of which were grad level), I still do not like theoretical or quantum or even computational chemistry. I did enjoy thermodynamics and pchem because of the multivariable equations and PDEs. I could work in a chemistry lab setting, but I'm not good in a chemistry lecture or exam. I would feel like that can inhibit any virology setting since I would have to work at labs and do QCs and analytics.

Masters in Math since I thought I wanted to do data science in healthcare. Or if that didn't work out, then I would have done biophysics. So far my math skills are not that great. I know some computer programming, but not enough for data mining. My stats and probability are okay and definitely the highlight of my masters and undergrad. I did a lot of probability distributions, calculations, and predictions in data analysis. I did not use that many Markov or Stochastic models, but I am still building my experience.

My weakness in math would have been in topology and real analysis. My vector calculus is also subpar, and I still have difficulty with Stoke's Equations and vector fields, even though I used a lot of DiffQs in my undergrad engineering school. Since my topology and vector calculus is bad, I don't think I can do modeling or biophysical analysis of cardiovascular systems.

I would like to do more research into fluid mechanics and study Navier Stokes in the circulatory system, but like I mentioned, I would need to get better in vector calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to take modern physics, quantum mechanics, biophysics 1+2, and classical mechanics in the future. 

So far I know how to do NMRs and Xray Crystallographies from my chemistry labs. I know how to calculate the Fourier Series from my calc class, but I have yet to familiarize myself with the Fast Fourier. 

My physics class so far have been Kinematics, Engineering Physics, Waves and Optics, Electricity and Magnetism, and Thermodynamics.

7476,fv1wv6,"My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark Matter","  

**My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark** **Matter**: 

I think of space as composed of multiple phases, such as air and water as to create a surface where bubbles can form. The various bubbles formed are matter, but it takes high temperatures to make the matter we know, the big bubbles, so the current space bubbles that form are very small and short lived. There will always be lots of little bubbles forming at the temperature of vacuum of \~3K, but should be much less and zero bubbles forming inside of matter as the inside of the big bubbles is only one phase (like just air). The surface of matter is a place where space wants to reconnect the big matter bubbles but there is not enough energy to do it, since those big bubbles were made when space was hotter. This will lead to a sticky force at the surface of matter, and oscillations causing wave propagation outward with a finite speed due to matter being jittered around. In addition, two separate masses (big bubbles) will interact with one another through the wave fields they create at their surfaces due to them being jittered around, creating interfering waves between them. The creation of standing waves between them takes time (finite speed of space waves), in addition to the surface sticky force, giving rise to resistances to changes (inertia). Therefore, large masses in the galaxy and the universe may control the inertia as they control the standing waves that pervade the observable universe. This particle jitter due to zero-point fluctuation making little bubbles trying to recombine with the big bubbles is the quantum temperature jittering the big bubbles around.

So, there is jitter and standing waves between particles (big bubbles) due to the field waves they setup around their surfaces which propagate outward to interfere with one another. This causes two masses to emit waves towards one another interacting with one another with a delay due to their finite speeds. These waves at the surface of opposite particles distort the zero-point fluctuations by reducing them by adding more noise to the jitter (interference). This reduction which reduces the sticky force on the side of the particle facing the other particle results in an attractive force, and they begin to move towards one another creating the force of gravity.

Then, these things naturally give rise to large space distortions around matter where the zero-point fluctuations are distorted by matter and the standing wave interferences extending far outward, giving rise to matter like effects which then give rise to dark matter.",10,2020-04-04 16:41:05,physics

7485,fuzn7z,Why don’t we feel the centrifugal force of the Earths spin at the equator?,"Fairly simple question, really. If the centrifugal force of the Earth‘s spin can cause the diametre at the equator to be larger than the diametre at the poles, hence making the the earth more of an oblate spheroid, rather than a sphere; then that force must certainly counteract the force of gravity to an extent, thus making the force that we feel at the equator, less than at the poles. 

Obviously there’s something I’m missing here, since this is not the case. Assuming the gravitational force around Earth is uniform, the spin of the Earth should cause a fairly significant difference in acceleration towards the centre of the Earth. Especially if it creates a difference of 42km, when comparing the diametre at the equator with the diametre at the poles. (12,756km x 12,714km)

I am currently reading about topologic effects. Consider a spin-S particle with the Hamiltonian H = B •S and the spectral energy E_n=Bn. I have a 2S+1 degenercy for B=0. The Berry field strenght shows divergences in the parameter space for degernacy points (here B=0) that are sources for the Berry phase which is -1 in this case for a 2pi rotation of the B vector in a plane. I have multiple questions about that:

The textbock says that this sign change has the same origin to the sign change of the spinwavefunction of a fermion for a 2pi spinspace rotation. But why exactly? I get that the result is the same but the setups are much different.

Since gravitational waves exist, and every function can be approximated arbitrarily by having a large set of sine waves, it seems that it should be possible to arrange a large number of gravitational wave generators such that a 4D space bubble of the form required to compress space before the vehicle and expand it after it at exactly the right precisely calculated moments, resulting in the vehicle riding the such created bubble. This would *not* require any exotic matter as far as I can tell. 

Is there any reason why this wouldn't work theoretically? It seems such a simplistic idea that I wonder why nobody else published it. 

Practically, of course, no such thing as a gravitational wave generator exists yet (and synchronizing a few million human created supernovae to generate the exact right wave seems difficult).

So, the basic idea is that instead of carrying along an engine, the engine (the large number of gravitational generators (I have no idea whether you just need 2 or 2 million) would remain stationary (for example on Earth or somewhere in space).",0,2020-04-04 06:28:21,physics

I'm currently reading ""The Three-Body Problem"" by Liu Cixin. Without giving too much of the book away, a key component is about a habitable planet which orbits three suns.

I don't have a physics background apart from elementary study, but after doing some preliminary studying, I understand that the three body problem is concerned with finding the motion of three bodies given their initial velocity/direction vectors, and that no general solution has been found so far (please correct me if I'm wrong).

My question is regarding the fact that this habitable planet is presumably a ""fourth"" body - is there some implication that the mass of the fourth body is negligible with respect to the three bodies (suns in this case), and so can more or less be ignored?

Another question, is there some simulator that I can plug initial velocity/direction vectors in and observe the outcome? I am guessing this is only possible for known cases (since, if such simulator existed, we'd already have the solution to the problem).

Any relevant discussion is welcome, I am somewhat captivated by this problem. Thanks!",2,2020-04-03 23:18:14,physics

7519,fum361,Cloud Chambers and Particle Identification,"Hey guys, I've seen a few cloud chambers pop up in my feed today, notably from u/downbytherivermatt and u/oxtailCelery. And that got me thinking about how one might want to classify the particles being emitted by these radioactive materials, and I think have an idea to do that by only slightly modifying the already built projects.

If one were to place a uniform magnetic field through the cloud chamber then the different possibly emitted particles should act fairly differently. A good way to generate this uniform electric field is to place the sample chamber in or over a solenoid, such that the sample is in the middle section of the coil of wire. 

All the necessary physics now is fairly rudimentary if all you are looking for is a qualitative way to classify the particles. 

**F** = q\*(**v** x **B)**  (x denotes the cross product)

**F** = m |**v**|\^2  / |**r**| (this is in the direction of **r**)

Where q is the charge of the particle, m is the mass of the particle, **v** is the velocity, **r** is the radius of the circle traced by a centripetal force, and **B** is the magnetic field. **F** is force just like always. We can set these two forces equal to each other and do some rearranging to find the radius of their paths in the electric field.

**r** = m|**v**|/(q|**B**|sin(theta))

We know that in order to classify a particle we need to know its mass and its charge. From our equation for radius, we can qualitatively define them. The sign of the charge of the particle is defined by the chirality of the bend or spiral made in the cloud chamber (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Mass is then defined as how tight the turns are, tighter turns mean lower mass, wider turns mean higher mass. 

The best part about doing this qualitatively like this is that you never need to know the direction the magnetic field is pointing so long as you compare the qualities of the streaks to each other. If you have a streak turning clockwise and you see another streak turning counter-clockwise but tighter, then you know that your first streak is a heavier particle and of an opposite charge to the other streak. Since there are really only two charged particles we need to worry about, we can say the low mass particle is the electron and the high mass particle is the alpha particle. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not perfect, if I missed anything, please tell me. If anything I have said is inaccurate go ahead and grab me by my coattails. Other than that, I hope you guys find this to be a fun idea for your next cloud chamber project.",0,2020-04-03 21:53:23,physics

In practically the next lesson they go ""and btw, this element has 20+ protons shoved microscopically close together"".  Why do atoms stay together instead of exploding?  The only explanation I've ever found is that somehow there is a nuclear force that holds it all together.  Have we really met the limits of modern physics in a high school class, or do I just not understand nuclear force enough?  How does it work.  Why does it pull inward.  How does it only pull just enough to keep things from exploding, but not enough to like...fuse/collapse the atom?

I think when most people think about time dilation from general relativity they imagine space ships that are going much faster than the earth resulting in time on earth going faster relative to the space ship.

Could we reverse that effect so that someone in a spaceship would age 1 year for every 2 years someone on earth would age at the same time?

I'm thinking we would need to make a spaceship that goes slower through space relative to the earth.

\- Which direction should the spaceship travel to go slower relative to the earth?

\- How fast would we have to go in that direction to make time on the spaceship 2x faster than earth and how would you calculate that?

I think there are a lot of useful applications for this.   For example:

\- We could put a research team on this spaceship and they could finish whatever they're researching or producing much faster relative to the time on earth (ex. a covid-19 cure could be made faster)

\- We could put supercomputers on the spaceship and they could finish calculations faster.

\- I could go on the spaceship and have more time to figure out how to ask out the girl I like before we go to college :P",6,2020-04-02 21:37:50,physics

Less becomes the object as the drain deepens and the layers fill one up. Hear it feels almost like a box pushed on by a fixed wall. On every layer resides a box.

first of all, i thought about what mass actually is. I think there isn't such a thing as a mass and it is just a proportion of some particle's resists to change in their action and having an acceleration. But, what concerns me is light. It does not accelerate nor change its speed. It actually does not interact with the universe in the way some particles do. But at the end, photons are particles. They do have momentum but they don't resist in the same way to the action because they have no mass. We define the momentum of a photon as Planck Constant over wavelength. And we can also use the equation p\*c=mc\^2 so momentum is E/c. We assume that photon has mass and derive equations. Because it must be true for all particles. Now, the problem in my mind is about Compton's scattering. When the photon and electron collides, Theirs momentums change vectorially.  The electron has mass. So it resists to the force that is applied and has an acceleration and changes its velocity so is momentum. But the photon does not resist to the that ""physical"" force, does not accelerate and does not change its  speed. But its velocity does change vectorially. This means the photon resisted something and it changed its momentum. But what does that? p=h/wavelength. What is actually vectorial here? The other formula is p=E/c that actually shows how its momentum vectorially changes because of the ""c"". But i wonder what causes this change. Because of no resisting maybe its velocity and acceleration is equal every time. I read somethings about 4-momentums but i still couldn't fix  the problems. What does a massless particle resist to? How the reaction force applied to it? These are my question.",0,2020-04-02 11:29:57,physics

John Lennon famously once said, ""Life is what happens while you are busy making other plans."". If you replace the word life with the word time in his quote, you are left with a good definition of what time is. Time is only a period in the progression of events that was NOT observed by you. So time is the unknown. That's it, that is all it is. People try to make it complicated, when it is not. 

Observation doesn't require extrapolation or guess work as to how events may have unfolded, it is time that does. Time is the unknown because it was unobserved by you. Time is the unknown progression of events that happened somewhere or for something that you were not observing. 

Time is not some currency that must be spent to buy motion or change. The pot will continue to boil whether you observe it or not. Time does not determine where change and motion can occur, it only represents a period of change and motion that went unobserved by you. 

Time does not exist where you ARE observing, it only exists where you are NOT observing. You don't observe a ball progress through time, you observe the progression of change and motion of that ball. Time is what happened somewhere else that you missed out on observing while you were observing the ball instead.

This interpretation makes sense of the notion that time would not exist for God or a supreme being that could observe everywhere and everything all at once. Because if you could observe every object and every location in the universe simultaneously, time would literally not exist FOR YOU. This is because no progression would be missed by your observation, hence nothing would be unknown BY YOU. 

You must understand that there can be two different kinds of time. There is individual time from the perspective of one observer, and there is collaborative time where multiple observers work together to compare notes or combine observations. This means there would be a personal history and a collaborative history.

So from the perspective of an observer in the US, the events that happened in China that he missed out on observing himself would be his individual time. But when the guy from China comes and tells him what happened in China while he was observing the US, and the guy from the US returns the favor, they have now eliminated some time by collaborating and making a collective history. 

So, collaborative time will always be less than individual time, and collaborative documentation of chronology will always be more documentation than individual documentation. You can only document what is KNOWN because it was OBSERVED. 

Chronology documented by observation is what should be called history, because it is known. Extrapolation is not documentation. Your extrapolation or speculation of events unobserved by you will never be as reliable or accurate as the actual observation of those events by others. 

Time is a period of chronology or progression that was NOT observed by you, or by a group of collaborating observers. History is chronology that WAS observed and documented by you, or a group of collaborating observers. So time could be thought of as being the opposite of history. 

It is very important to understand that time and chronology are NOT the same thing. Chronology speaks of causality and order of events. Time speaks of events that were not observed by you. Chronology is like when you number each frame on a film reel. Time would be like if someone cut out a segment of that film reel, spiced it together, and then played that film for you. That missing segment in the film reel represents the concept of time, because some of that chronology or progression of events was unobserved by you.

Chronology is the true progression or the true order of events. It is not your observation, documentation, or understanding of  what that true order or progression was.  Chronology is objective and just is what it is regardless of whether you observed it or not.   


Time is just a word, it doesn't do anything, it doesn't cause anything, and it doesn't progress. Time does not represent motion or change itself, and it is not a requirement for motion and change to occur. It is just a word that represents a period of progression that happened somewhere that went unobserved by you alone, or by a group of collaborating observers. 

Entropy is the irreversible elimination of possibilities for a system, that is brought about by the progression of change and motion, not by some boogeyman named time. It is not time that ages you or that causes systems to deteriorate, it is spatial motion of objects and internal change of those objects that does. 

Time is NOT the ""arrow for entropy"" or vice versa. It is CHRONOLOGY that is that arrow. This is because chronology and entropy are things that progress and have a direction. Time does not progress and has no direction. It doesn't make sense to think that a period of unobserved progression can be something that is progressing itself. A period in the PAST cannot change. 

Time WAS the unknown and unobserved progression of events that happened somewhere else. I capitalized the word ""was"" in my previous sentence, because the most important thing for you to understand is that time can only exist in the past. Time does not exist in the present, so it does not exist where you are observing. Time does not exist until AFTER the progression or chronology is completed and you missed observing it. Your lack of observation of that progression is what CREATES time. The only thing that time can measure is a period of your non-observation. 

The ultimate example of CREATING time for yourself is while you sleep. This is because when you wake up you can't be sure of all the changes that may have happened while you were sleeping. Because you weren't observing those things while you were sleeping. So time was being created EVERYWHERE for you while you were sleeping, including where your body was during the progression. Now you must try to extrapolate what happened or ask another observer that was awake. 

Time has absolutely nothing to do with rates or speeds and it is not a dimension. It has to do with lack of observation of the progression of events. You never observe ""time progressing"" or ""experience time"", it is quite the opposite. Time is what you did NOT observe and did NOT experience.

Einstein himself said that time is only a mode of thought and not conditions in which we live. Time is a thought that represents an unobserved period in the PAST. Physical objects or forces in the present cannot change what the past was by curving it, distorting it, or ""slowing it down"". Time is not a speed or rate that represents the speed or rate of progression. So time is not something that can be slowed down. 

Trying to measure time with a clock is no different than trying to measure temperature with a clock. Because neither time nor temperature have rates or represent rates. Every physics equation that involves ""time"", is a misrepresentation of what time actually is. People not understanding the difference between clocks and time is what leads to the belief in ridiculous bullshit such as time dilation. You can't ""dilate"" chronology, because chronology is things that have ALREADY happened.

Noon is called twelve o'clock instead of twelve o'time for a reason. This is because noon describes the position of the hands on a clock, and not the position of time. When the rate of a clock slows down it only means that the rate of a clock has slowed down, it says nothing at all about time. Because a clock was not intended to measure time, it was intended to measure the rate of rotation of the Earth.

Clocks were created to help mankind remain in sync with the Earth's rotation. To help them manage their lives and remain in sync with the day, the night, and with each other. So clocks serve a practical purpose but that purpose is not to measure or represent time. It never IS a time, it only ever is a moment in chronology, or a moment in the progression of change and motion. Past, present, and future are adjectives that describe the placement of moments in chronology, not their placement in time.

So in the equation, s = d/t, you are not really calculating speed against time, you are calculating the speed of one thing against the speed or rate of something else, whether it be a clock or the rate of rotation of the Earth that the clock was intended to represent. Time is not a rate, so it should not be measured or represented by a rate, and it should not be used as a measurement of a rate. Time should only be used as a measurement of periods that went unobserved. 

If your clock slows down when you move somewhere that is causing or experiencing different amounts of gravity than found on Earth, it just means that your clock cannot function the SAME way under DIFFERENT conditions. It doesn't mean that time has ""slowed down"". It just means that you need to re-gear your clock if you want it to turn at the same rate it would on Earth.

That necessary adjustment to your clock doesn't mean anything about time. If you wanted to hit a golf ball on the moon the same distance that you would hit one on Earth, you would have to make an adjustment to how hard you swing your club because of the difference in gravity.

If the rate of your clock slows down when you begin traveling at speeds approaching the speed of light, that also is not evidence of time ""slowing down"". It simply means that the clock must now trade internal motion of its hands for more external velocity across space.

Time = A gap in your observation of the progression of change and motion that occurred in between two known (observed) moments in that progression. Lack of observation CREATES TIME that must later be extrapolated to try to understand how things MIGHT have happened while you were NOT observing. Time only exists where you are not looking so to speak. More precisely, time only exists where you didn't look in the PAST.  Time is the unknown created by gaps in your observation of somewhere or something.

Look, I totally get it, I am a sci-fi nerd too. So I know it is fun and interesting to talk about the ""what if's"" of time dilation and Marty McFly fantasies. But time cannot be changed, because time has already happened, and we missed out on observing it. Science books are not the appropriate place to document our fantasies, things like that should be left to Hollywood. So I say it is ""about time"" to remove from science books these fictitious and illogical descriptions of time, so those pages can instead be filled with a realistic explanation.

Once we do that, we will all then realize that our common goal should be to work together combining our observations to eliminate the enemy of knowledge, that is time.",0,2020-04-02 03:00:34,physics

7638,ftffff,Asking for my dad: can a gust of wind blow a car off jackstands?,"I dont think this could ever happen short of a hurricane/tornado, but he thinks it's possible. He says he would feel better if I asked about it.

It would be a small convertible weighing 3000lbs with about a 45/55 front/rear weight distribution.  The car would have jack stands at all four corners and the frame of the car would be less than 2 feet off the ground. It would also be sitting about 3 feet from a retaining wall that would be higher than the roof of the car. The car would be level but the rear jack stands would be extended, at max, maybe 4 inches higher than the front ones, because the driveway slopes slightly downhill. 

The top of the jack stands are u-shaped, so they cradle the frame rails rather than it being a flat interface. Therefore I think no amount of horizontal force would cause the frame rails to slide off the jack stands. Instead, it would require enough horizontal force to cause the entire car to flip upward and off the stand on one side. 

My logic is that the normal force at each jack stand, multiplied by the static coefficient of friction of steel on concrete, would mean that it would take an absolutely tremendous force of wind to flip the car off the jack stands. 

I made the point that if the wind was strong enough to make this happen, pretty much all other cars on the street would be sliding around, and something like a lifted truck with a high center of gravity would be overturned. 

Not my car but mine is the same model:

1. All knowledge is ultimately circular. Break any idea down long enough and you'll end up with ideas, like 'time', for which all definitions end up circular.

&amp;#x200B;

Specifically concerning numbers : You can't escape the fact that trying to define what a number actually is begins and ends with the pragmatic observation that we, and other machines, are able to count. Logic and set theory, themselves based on self-evident, circular, concepts (try to define 'set') are circularly dependent on each other and even if you reduce everything to just manipulations of symbols you'll just end up with a machine that can count and perform calculations.

&amp;#x200B;

You can't escape the self-evident and circular nature of the fundamental ideas.

&amp;#x200B;

2. You can't define randomness because actually defining it ceases to make it truly random. Randomness appears when you can't measure any further. This means that measurement, and the knowledge coming from it, stops. The scientific method just stops there.

Bell's Theorem is just a strange and backwards way of saying : Pure chance cannot be defined.

&amp;#x200B;

3. All mathematical theories of physics end up plagued by logical trivialism and there is no experimental support for new physics beyond the standard model that they hope could solve those problems. Physics is pushed further and further into untestability and pipe dreams like String Theory. And the longer this process lasts, and it has already lasted for over a generation, the more likely it becomes that no further revolution(s) in that area are to be expected.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, it's better to notice that the themes of unmeasurability, randomness, logical trivialism and the inability to perform further experiments all imply the absence of further knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

4. And when they venture into metaphysical speculation like many worlds, multiverse or simulation theory they end up on the same playing field as the traditional religions. You get no points for making a metaphysical theory just 'sciency' sounding, it's after all the evidence that counts. But seeing as they end up on the same playing field as religion, those traditional religions all of a sudden have more evidence going for them. After all, a religion \_is\_ a remarkable event and just that, and other remarkable things about them, is more evidence than just zero for many worlds, multiverse or simulation theory with the last mimicking traditional religion so closely that it's just silly.

&amp;#x200B;

You should notice that those sciency religions are very close to 'anything goes', to logical trivialism.

&amp;#x200B;

Here endeth the lesson.

I have been watching Penroses lectures and talks for years now, and every now and then he carefully puts out some criticism about the way how people interpret Schrödingers Cat.

As example, Sean Carroll goes as far as postulating that there are infinite parallel universes, presenting it as scientific fact. PBS Space Time and Veritasium also took on the subject, among others.

Now what Penrose says is that Schrödinger never meant for the experiment to be scientific proof of parallel universe, but instead what he really said is that quantum mechanics is **wrong** .

He basically said ""look guys this theory is so nuts it would mean that my cat is both alive and dead at the same time, we are clearly missing something here"". 

Also i see many physicists now claim that consciousness causes the collapse (observation/measurement problem), literally claiming that the mind creates the laws of nature which is just ridiculous and very medieval semi-christian geocentric thought. 

Like, we have no clue what causes the wave collapse or what causes the particle to go in either ""up"" or ""down"" upon measurement. So why do so many renowned physicists claim to know how it works?

I know from the superposition principle that any wave function can be written as a linear combination of other wave functions, that is psi (x,y,z) can be broken down into three different wave functions each in one of three dimensions. We can also apply this linear combination to the total Hamiltonian to yield an operator in each of the three dimensions, as well as to the total energy of the system to yield energy in each of the three dimensions. 

My question is: Why is the linear combination of WAVEFUNCTIONS written as a PRODUCT of the three wavefunctions?

A 0.25 kg base ball going at a constant velocity of some arbitrarily high velocity that would do some damage to a human, let's say something like 30 m/s. The ball hits someone directly on the chest going this constant velocity. 

Does the ball impart no force onto the chest and vice versa (I think not)? Or is it the sudden change in velocity; the deceleration that force is measured when the ball impacts the chest? So if the ball when from 30 m/s to 0 m/s instantaneously before rebounding off of the chest, then F = 0.25 x 30 right? 

So basically if an object has a constant velocity, then no force is acting upon it, it is only when the velocity changes that there is a force acting on it. Right?",9,2020-03-31 04:36:31,physics

He admits that it would look like a stable equilibrium due to the tendency of the charge to return to the centre after any small perturbation along the diagonals; but it is actually not so due to Laplace's equation for no extrema. All this is well and clear and he argues that the centre is actually a saddle point. However he asks the reader to see how said charge would esacpe confinement and leak out of the cube.

7779,frsd16,The best thing you can do to fight COVID-19 is nothing. Stop writing that paper. Don't put it on the arxiv.,"In recent days we've seen an influx in papers on the [arxiv modeling the spread of COVID-19.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11230) Many of these are relatively simple papers clearly written by physicists using simple SIR models, some basic curve fitting, and even Ising models to model the spread of COVID-19. 

I'm writing to ask you, from the bottom of my heart, to **cut that shit out.**

This is not an unexplained X-ray line from the galactic center. This is not the 750 GeV diphoton excess. This is not something where the first paper to correctly guess the peak number of COVID-19 cases on the arxiv gets a Nobel prize. People's lives are at stake and you're not helping. 

At best, you make physicists look bad. Epidemiology, as a field, already exists. Any prediction from a physicist tinkering with equations pulled from Wikipedia is not going to be a better prediction than that of professional public health experts whose models are far more sophisticated and already validated.

At worst, people die. 

I'm serious. Let's imagine the outcome of one of these hobby papers. Suppose Dr. Jones from ABC University dusts off an SIR code he wrote for a class project in grad school, and using some numbers from the CDC finds that approximately 10% of the world catches the disease. The paper assumes a few percent die, which means millions dead. Dr. Jones puts it up on the arxiv. Tomorrow's headline? ""Physicists calculate 3 million Americans dead of COVID by July, predicts 100 million cases!"" What happens after that? People panic. And when people panic, they make bad decisions. Those bad decisions can kill people. 

Yes, I am literally suggesting that your paper on the arxiv might kill someone. This is already happening with the daily news cycle. Bad information gets disseminated, people get scared, and they react in the worst possible way. With your credentials you have the ability to create enormously powerful disinformation.

Don't believe me? Reporters watch the arxiv for things to report on. Those reporters are not scientists. All they know is that a scientist said something, so it's fair game to put in a headline. The public is even less scientifically literate than those reporters, and when a person with credentials says something scary a very large number of people take it at face value. To many people, 'Ising Model' only means 'algorithm equation calculus that says we're gonna die' because they are not physicists. You run the risk of becoming exactly the kind of disinformation and obfuscation that exacerbates the ongoing crisis. You become a punchline to a denier that says, ""They can't decide if there's going to be hundred thousand cases or a hundred million cases! Scientists don't know anything!""

Consider the pros and cons. The pros? You aren't going to contribute to the understanding of the crisis with a first order model you cooked up in a few days. The benefit of one preprint to your tenure packet is minimal (and most universities are adjusting their tenure process so that this semester won't penalize you). The cons? I hope I've convinced you by now that there can be serious consequences. 

What's the alternative to this conversation we're having right now? In a year, we'll be talking about the time a pundit got on air, referenced a 'physicist's calculation that predicts 3 million dead by July,' and people panicked. We'll be talking about what we can do differently in the future. We'll be discussing requiring an ethics seminar for graduate students (like *every other field!*). We'll be talking about what sort of ethics surround putting out a preprint outside our immediate area of expertise during 
a major public health crisis. 

I'd like to live in a world where people are reasonable, and where it's safe to share ideas and calculations freely. I'd like to live in the world where the public will listen to us when we explain which numbers are fun afternoon projects from physicists and which are the current best projections by major public health organizations. We don't live in that world. Please, be pragmatic about this, and don't put that paper on the arxiv.",320,2020-03-30 10:01:50,physics

Cue me falling into an internet abyss researching whether or not, theoretically, pausing time could be possible (yes I know this is further procrastination but I don’t care).

Then I got confused and abbandoned my time travel/pause hopes and became more interested in the possibility of travelling at the speed of light. I just wanna say I am not a physicist, I’m 17 and I just graduated and I didn’t even study physics in high school cause I was scared I’d fail it (I just did chem and bio, worst decision I’ve made), so if I seem stupid or this is a stupid question then sorry.

Anyway, so I kinda got the gist that only something with a mass of 0 aka photons aka light could travel at that speed. But here’s my question, if we could somehow upload our consciousness into a hologram version of ourselves (which already I know isn’t possible, at least atm) could we then travel at the speed of light in our hologram bodies? Or maybe even faster until we somehow exited the universe where the laws of physics don’t apply, where I could then pause time and not have to clean my kitchen?

Now that I’ve written this I kinda realised that a hologram would always be travelling at the speed of light because it IS light and idk if that already just throws my whole questioning out the window. I’m just confused now. Any dumbed down answers and explanations would be appreciated.

I’ll start off by saying that I have no background in physics, I’ve had a physics class for a year and then dropped it. 

But after I dropped it I somehow got into a discussion with someone who did take the class about the planck length. He said that it’s the smallest length possible and that there’s nothing that can be smaller. So I said that you could take half a planck length or even 1/100 of a planck length for that matter and it would be smaller. He disagreed and told me that that’s impossible, a physics teacher walked by and I asked him to back me up but he agreed with my friend. I told him that literally everything can be divided by two infinitely but he disagreed.

I searched online for a bit but I couldn’t find anything about lengths that are smaller than the planck length. But I was hoping that anyone here could tell me whether I was right, because I was and still am convinced that my point was valid.

I always heard that field theories are mechanical systems with infinite number of degrees of freedom. I wanted to learn more about this relation and came across with the following statement:

“Field theory is called integrable iff it possesses infinite number of conserved quantities {J_n} which are functionally independent and Poisson commute.”

This is direct generalization of the integrability in mechanical systems with finite number of degrees of freedom. In case of mechanical systems this was really useful: if one has sufficient number of conserved quantities, then the solution of Euler-Lagrange (or Hamiltonian) equations is reduced to solving algebraic equations. 

But in case of classical field theories for me it is unclear if conserved quantities are useful in solving the equations of motion. Of course, integrals of motions are important themselves: a lot physics and symmetries are related to them. In quantum theory they became even more important, the basis of Hilbert space of physical states are constructed as common eigenstates of this quantities. But still physics and quantum theory aside can we use conserved quantities to solve the equations of motion in classical field theory as in  mechanical systems? 

I heard that this IMs are related to hierarchies of equations, which all can be solved by inverse scattering method, but I wonder why in the context of one theory this is important.",0,2020-03-29 09:57:07,physics

While most traditional science deals with supposedly predictable phenomena like gravity, electricity, or chemical reactions, Chaos Theory deals with nonlinear things that are effectively impossible to predict or control, like turbulence, weather, the stock market, our brain states, and so on. These phenomena are often described by fractal mathematics, which captures the infinite complexity of nature. Many natural objects exhibit fractal properties, including landscapes, clouds, trees, organs, rivers etc, and many of the systems in which we live exhibit complex, chaotic behaviour. Recognizing the chaotic, fractal nature of our world can give us new insight, power, and wisdom. For example, by understanding the complex, chaotic dynamics of the atmosphere, a balloon pilot can “steer” a balloon to the desired location. By understanding that our ecosystems, our social systems, and our economic systems are interconnected, we can hope to avoid actions which may end up being detrimental to our long-term well-being.",0,2020-03-29 09:24:17,physics

Okay so there’s a theory in quantum physics that are a infinite different versions of us in infinite other worlds, and us, like the conscious in our body right now, lives in all these other worlds, just at different times. So like when I die my consciousness will just go to another world and it will keep doing it and doing it. And there’s also another theory in quantum physics that time doesn’t really exist. Time just travels forward so that is how we perceive time. And at the quantum level things get hella weird and they don’t quite understand it all. So it’s very possible that our dreams are just us in another world at a different time. So us sleeping allows us to see ourselves at different times in different worlds. When we go to sleep our consciousness jumps through time into a different world, but since time doesn’t really exist in a liner way, it’s more like a fabric so it can travel all different directions. So what if our consciousness travels through time and space to these other worlds but since our consciousness is technically still in our bodies, because we are still, alive we see it to. There’s a quantum physics law called entanglement. It says that two subatomic particles are basically bound together and they mimic each other, so basically if one is spinning one way the other will spin the same way, no matter how far away the subatomic particles are. Like different sides of the country far apart. So what if all of our subatomic particles are entangled with the subatomic particles of our other selves on these other worlds and that is why we see ourselves in our dreams in these other worlds.

This term I ran across campus to meet graduate students and professors, read papers for weeks albeit their difficulty and wrote lots of cover letters and resumes in hopes to get the opportunity to volunteer in one of their projects and learn some good skills i'd be able to use in the future. I worked real hard and was lucky to get the opportunity to find a potential group focused on synthesis of nano-materials. I even got a 1-to-1 interview with a graduate student to see whether I could contribute to their project and I was extremely thrilled. Things seemed to go well and he said i'm a good candidate, that he'd teach me lab techniques for a week and that i'd be able to recreate and then if i was okay, that id be able to help their exciting research.

But, right after i finished my interview, my university announced it was going to close due to covid-19 and one thing led to another, I kept in touch with the graduate and he kept sending me resources to study and i was really grateful. However, it now seems as though i'm not going to be able to do anything this summer because covid is getting worse here in canada and as an international student i have to head back home (whole reason i was staying this summer was to volunteer for the local food bank and research project - both got cancelled).

Now my entire plans for this summer are skewed but I really want to be able to spend it doing something fruitful and to gain some good skills for when i apply for jobs.

From what i red it doesn't seem that we understand really what it is or am i wrong ? Where it does come from and what it is really ?

When physicists study physics do their study the universe do they study the ""fishtank"" only or do they study the ""water"" as much as the ""fishtank"" ? (by fishtank i mean the rules and laws of physics by water i mean energy ) it perhaps a false analogy and i'm sorry.

do we know why energy transformed itself into matter and do we know what decides that for example 2 atoms of Hydrogen and 1 of oxygen becomes water ?

The more i read about the physics and biology it really seems that we are in a kind programation. ATGC and how the elements of the periodic table seems like to follow order and laws like in a kind of program which commands Data and information.

Me:  
MEng Elec Eng Univ. Glasgow/CERN

PhD at Univ. Glasgow/CERN  
\- Doct student at CERN working on LHC energy increase to 6.5 TeV (magnet tech/accelerator physics)  
Postdoc at Univ. Hudd/CERN  
\- HL-LHC studies (accelerator physics)

Channel:  
Basic idea, trying to take into account as big an audience as possible:  
How do we (scientist types) get from y=mx+c to simulating and ultimately building and physically colliding particles in the LHC?

Its a question I find fascinating that I can, at this stage in my career (\~8 years post undergrad), actually vaguely probably kind of answer, although it would probably take quite a while to do so - plenty episode content!

Note that something that has always intrigued me is the general populations question of math at high school etc ""What is it for?"" ""Am I ever going to use this?"" ""How does it relate to the real world?"", and engaging the next generation would also be of interest

There are a TON of physics channels and no-one cares, trying to figure out what I can do to be of interest - this is not for any monetary gain tbh, just fun

More personal:   
I'm relatively young \~30 (wrong side), so I could probably relate to the demographic more than most lecturer types. I'm also bipolar, this has been/is the biggest challenge, but I somehow manage to stay on top of it, YouTube viewership seems to also be interested in personal stories - I got a few.

I think I would basically just start an informal channel trying to be more engaging in discussion rather than serious lectures - I'm not a very serious person tbh, lol, then gradually work up to formal lectures if it feels right.

Long ass post is long.  
TLDR; want to know how the LHC works from the ground up? Would you be interested in a YouTube channel that explained it?

8057,fopwnb,Static electricity on the moon and why the Apollo 15 flag moved when the astronaut didn't touch it,"I have been doing a bit of research about the [moment captured on video](https://vimeo.com/2109735#t=159s) during the Apollo 15 moon landing when the astronaut David Scott bounced past a flag and the flag started to move. The cause of the movement is debated. A semi-official explanation on [Nasa's Apollo 15 lunar surface journal](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a15/a15.clsout2.html) is that Scott touched the flag with his elbow (see the entry at 148:57:15). The journal says that the idea he was carrying a static charge which caused the flag to move is ""very unlikely"" since there were no similar flag movements seen in other moon walks. However, I think Scott was too far from the flag to have touched it, as shown in [this video of a 3d recreation of the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsYcOiyuVC4). According to that, Scott was about a metre from the flag. So I think the movement must have been caused by static electricity.

According to this [slideshow by a NASA scientist](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160013625.pdf) (slides 7 and 8), static charges dissipate on the moon in microseconds, which would make it hard to see how Scott could have been carrying a charge when he passed the flag. The reason for the fast dissipation is the solar wind, which bombards the moon with electrons and protons and creates a ""plasma sheath"" of electrons around the moon. These ambient electrons act as a ground to any positive charge and dissipate it. Interestingly, though, a negative charge takes slightly longer to dissipate, because it is dissipated by the ions in the solar wind, which are less dense than the electrons in the moon's plasma sheath. I found an interesting paper, ""[Concerning the dissipation of electrically charged objects in the shadowed lunar polar regions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034785)"", which gives a formula for the amount of time it takes for a static charge to dissipate on the moon. As an example they provide calculations for a position 85 degrees from the subsolar point (the point directly under the sun) -- near the ""terminator"" region (the terminator is the line between the day and nightsides of the moon). But I think the maths actually works anywhere on the dayside surface, for negative charges at least, since the density of incoming ions from the solar wind is the same everywhere on the dayside, at 5 per cubic centimetre.

The most interesting fact is that the time taken for the charge to dissipate is inversely proportional to the area that the charge covers. This is because the larger the area, the more ions will come into contact with the charged surface, and the quicker the charge will be dissipated. So if the charge is concentrated in a small area, it takes longer to dissipate. The example given in the paper is of an astronaut's spacesuit, with an area of 10 square metres. They say a negative charge would dissipate from a spacesuit in 0.003 seconds. But for an astronaut's boot, which is only 1m², the charge would take ten times longer (0.03 seconds) to dissipate. Using the formula given I calculated that a negative charge that covered only 80cm² would take 3.5 seconds to dissipate, which would have given Scott time to receive the charge off-camera and to move past the flag while still charged, making the flag move.

Using the [Quickfield](https://quickfield.com/free_soft.htm) electric field simulation software I set up a [3D scene](https://i.imgur.com/eOom8fl.png) where an astronaut is one metre from a flag, and set an 80cm² area on the astronaut's arm to be charged to -10,000 volts. [The result showed](https://i.imgur.com/KHDqZOk.png) that the presence of the charge on the astronaut produced a force of 0.000002 Newtons on a selected 9.3cm² area in the corner of the flag. I have not studied physics but using the procedure outlined [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-linear-momentum/introduction-to-linear-momentum-and-impulse-ap/v/force-vs-time-graphs) I tried to calculate the effect this force would have on the flag. Assume that the force was applied for 1 second, which is about the amount of time it took the astronaut to pass. 0.000002 Newtons for one second is an impulse of 0.000002 Newton-seconds. Since impulse/mass = final velocity - initial velocity, and since the initial velocity is zero, it's just necessary (I think) to divide this impulse by the mass of the small flag section to find the velocity in meters per second that the flag section would end up with.

[This flag](https://www.usflagstore.com/US_Flag_3x5_Embroidered_Nylon_p/60-100-3111.htm) is the same size as the one used on the moon (3' by 5') and according to the linked web page it weighs .55 lbs, which is 249 grams. In the moon's gravity 249 grams would be 41.17 grams. 9.3cm² is 0.00067 times smaller than the full flag, so reduce the weight by the same factor to find the weight of the piece of flag we are looking at. This works out as 0.028 grams, or 0.000028 kilograms. 0.000002Ns / 0.000028kg = 0.07 metres per second, or 7cm per second. So according to this, the 9.3cm² area of flag would have been moving at 7cm per second after the astronaut passed. This speed seems reasonable, however, I assume that the calculation is not totally accurate, since it would seem to give the velocity if the force was applied upwards, against the moon's gravity, rather than sideways. I don't know enough to take the direction of the force into account. Presumably it would take less force to move the flag sideways than to move it upwards, so the charge on the astronaut would not need to be as large as -10,000 volts to cause the movement seen. It would be great if anyone knows how much force would be needed to move the flag sideways.

As to how the astronaut received the charge, I assume he touched some object offscreen, perhaps a piece of metal equipment. The spacesuits were coated in Teflon, which is [very electronegative](https://www.alphalabinc.com/triboelectric-series/).",68,2020-03-25 08:03:28,physics

I think I understand that there is no an absolute time that ticks the same for all of us and that there is this thing called ""proper time"" or ""inner time"" (or something like that) which is what an observer would experience in his own frame of reference. This rate of passage of time depends on things like the velocity the observer is travelling with or gravitational fields affecting him.

I've read a bit on it in places like  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental\_testing\_of\_time\_dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation) where one can see how moving muons have longer lifetimes than resting ones...

Now comes the question from me...

Is the ""proper time"" of two quantum entangled particles necessarily the same? Can their clocks tick at different rates?

If it would be necessarily the same, would this imply that the state being entangled is something that we can declare to be independent of things like velocity, gravity, etc?

Perhaps a pair of particles would be entangled if and only if their internal clocks are exactly the same one. The moment something ""perturbs"" the common clock, entanglement vanishes...

Perhaps the most important question... does the question itself make at least a bit of sense?

So , there is fuck ton of syllabus and I have the attention span of 10 seconds , I am working on that . We have Modern Physics , Mathematical Physics and Analog systems as core for this semester .

I don't understand how others are able to study and keep up their grades at average . While I am overwhelmed by every single topic I come across .

I was reading Arthur Beiser for Modern Physics and I was not able to understand how he sort of derived the Uncertainity Principle from Gaussian Distribution . It takes me a lot of time to read few pages . 

Then we have Complex Analysis for Mathematical Physics , the teacher at college gives interesting insight and stuff in class and refers Schaum's Outline for problems . I come home , open the book and the book follows a different pattern and a loads of things and questions based on topics that sir did not discuss and I am stuck at reading everything from scratch and there goes a chunk of time because I am not able to filter out what I should not be reading . This happens even when I know the syllabus .

We were given a task to get familiar with fourier transforms , I found a decent lecture on youtube but I needed further reading and questions so I refer books recommended in our syllabus and woah , that book has written the formula in a new language and nope , Ifound bunch of more lectures and I really did not know what I wanted because everyone was using either of two forms and I have no idea what to do. I did find 3b1b's lovely video but that's not what I needed .

8174,fnggke,Highschool (A-Level) Physics: A Rant + Asking for help,"Hello, I'm a junior high school student currently doing CIE's A Level curicullum. However, I do believe that my experiences represent those from all over the world throughout most curicullums. 

I find it difficult to engage  in my school's Physics curiculum. Don't get me wrong, I love studying Physics. The reason that I engage in Physics whenever I self-study at home is the discovery. Let's say I'm studying something like gravitational fields. I'm presented with a formula for Newton's universal law of gravitation. I would then spend a lot of time trying to re-derive it and figuring out how they came up with the equation, as well as its implications, for instance when something goes on orbit on a planet then its orbital shape would most likely be an ellipse instead of a circle. I would then try to derive other equations from the equations I already know of - like orbital period or the gpe. This is fun. This is engaging. And you feel great doing it, too, as if you're actually discovering something. 

Instead, the way Physics is taught in school, there's a certain problem with an unknown (find the tension, what is the resistance, etc), we're asked to draw a free body diagram and solve for the unknown. Rinse and repeat. The problems are not easy, don't get me wrong. Some of them are hard, and even fun to solve, but it's just *so fucking boring.* For example, a few months ago we were learning about superposition, and we were getting to the topic of Young's double slit experiment. 

The first time I read about this subject, my mind was blown. It completely changed my view on what light is. It blowed my mind even more when I learned that electrons can achieve the same effect.  Learning the history behind it and its importance has also brought me new perspective. This is all so fascinating, but from the way it's taught in school, if you haven't heard of the topic prior, you'd think it's the most boring thing in the world. The teacher showed us a 2D image - two slits, then lines going through it. The way the teacher explained it was so dull and anticlimactic. *The light passes through the slits and superpose and form interference patterns. WHen the path difference between the rays of light are half a wavelength, they are in antiphase. Etc etc.* 

Then they show us the formula (wavelength = ax/D) and then we have to do problems to try and solve for the fringe seperation, slit seperation, slit-to-screen distance, and this is where it gets soul crushing. Why do you even need to calculate this stuff? Instead of learning about how the world works, we're learning about how to find the distance between the slit and the screen! Why!? I think it's safe to say that no one's ever gonna use this stuff, unless you wanna become an experimental physicist, which in my school is basically no one. 

Another problem I have is that A Level physics (idk if other curicullums are like this) is too Engineering based. And the problems that usually come with engineering tend to be boring, like finding the friction of a block sliding down a ramp, or applying Kirchoff's Voltage law to find the resistance. High school biology doesn't revolve around solving bio-engineering problems, nor does high school chemistry revolve around solving chemical engineering problems. So why is Physics so Engineering related? Don't get me wrong, I like Engineering (it's probably what I'm going to major in), but it's sucking the fun out of doing physics. 

Don't get me started on the practicals. Out of anything, I love experiments. Back when we didn't do A Level, we could design our own experiments and formulate our own hypothesis, and it was actually really fun, even though the experiments are about mundane things (e.g balls falling from a certain height.) Nonetheless, there's still the sense of discovery, and everyone enjoyed it. The practicals that we're currently doing usually goes like this: they show a diagram of a certain experiment, without any context at all, and then we're asked to arrange the apparatus according to the diagram. Then we have to do some experiment asked to record some results in a table (e.g number of oscillations). Then we have to find errors/uncertainties in the data, plot a graph, and ask us to create a best fit line and find the gradient. That's it. No context about what we're doing and why we're doing it, or its scientific and historical significance.

The problem is, in order to get to the Uni I want to get into, I have to get an excellent score, and to do that I need to work on the problems. That's why I've been grinding on past papers for the last few days. Doing these problems, as I illustrated earlier, is soul crushing and makes me hate Physics. Anything to do with Physics makes me disgusted now, even though I find it fascinating. The problem is, I can't get an A\* by learning Physics the way I like since it's way too slow and it doesn't really fit with the examination's specification. 

My problem is, how do I compromise? I still want to get an A\*, and to do that I'm told I have to do a buttload of problems and exercises which makes me hate Physics. On the other hand, I want to actually have fun studying Physics! Can anyone help? Also, please comment your experiences with Physics in High School - it would be cool to hear!

So consider two different bodies A and B. A is moving with respect to B. Now for two observers A and B in the frames of Refrence of bodies A and B respectively will calculate different KE for the two bodies provided they have different masses. So that would mean that the total Energy ( energy of rest mass along with Kinetic energy would not be conserved.)

Moreover I mostly found articles related to Relativistic mass when I tried to read about this. And relativistic mass is anyways not an absolute quantity. And moreover it would only come into play at really high speeds. I think that both of these things are related, but can someone please clarify how should we say that energy is conserved in this case?

8198,fn2mky,"Quarantine thought experiment: If I was so big that the Andromeda galaxy was the relative size a penny is to me now, would it appear to me to be actively spinning or standing still?","More generally, does the relationship between space, time, and velocity imply that size also has an impact on time (at least at certain magnitudes)?

From Earth it effectively appears that Andromeda is standing still, since it takes millions of years to make one rotation. But if I was so large that the distances being covered by Andromeda were very small to me, would that change my perception of it’s motion because it would change my experience of the distances involved and also the passage of time from my reference point?

Conversely, if I shrank down so small that I could stand on an electron that was the relative size that Earth is to me now, would it seem to me that I was zipping around the nucleus at almost the speed of light, or much slower, due to my small size and the relative distances traveled?

Intuitively, both scenarios seem right to me, but I don’t know the physics well enough to say why. Very curious if any physicists have ever explored the nature of time when an object takes up a huge amount of space and can therefore cover large distances very quickly, but without moving very fast.

Hello, I imagine many students have moved their classes online as we have at my university. This has left my students as well as others’ feeling like they are not getting enough time with instructors to discuss the contents of their physics classes. I have come up with an idea about how to curb this a little. I am hosting a Twitch.tv stream located at Twitch.tv/physicsoh. I will be opening it up a certain times per week to make it available at no cost to students (or anyone for that matter) to come as ask questions or post suggestions (video or non) to others that our struggling.

I am a second-year graduate student studying particle physics and have been a TA of calc-based intro physics for 5 semesters including this one. I will happily take any question at an undergraduate level and hopefully be able to provide insight if not help you come to a solution using my “at home” teaching set up. 

I emphasize that this is a free service. At this time in our personal histories I believe it is important to step up and help each other out as we attempt to continue our education the only feasible way we currently can. With that said please know all questions and video submissions to the channel will be free, with instructions on the channel page. There is however a “Mature” warning simply because I am unsure or unfamiliar with my ability to screen content posted by others. When I become more fluent with this service I hope to remove the mature tag. 

The first session will be held today Saturday 3/21/2020 at 1pm Est and will end at approximately 4pm Est. The second session will be held on Monday 3/23/2020 at the same times. So, come one and all to discuss physics, have your questions answered, or just relax in our chilled study environment. Thanks, and best wishes,

After decades of failing to achieve that aim it was eventually deemed too difficult, proclaimed to be outright impossible, and then (apparently) entirely given up on.

Until recently, the only (partial) pattern known to connect the fundamental particles of matter was the Koide mass relation (see the Koide formula). Because this pattern only precisely connects the electron, muon and tau particles, and because its interpretation has remained unclear, this pattern has largely been ignored, considered mere numerology or coincidence, and usually goes unmentioned in physics studies.

Despite the supposed ‘impossibility’ of that task, a complete mass pattern (by generation and family) was recently discovered that matches the measured values of every single particle within the current known error bars. As this is new, I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about it.

To be as clear as possible, these generational and family mass patterns capture the masses of the Higgs boson, Z boson, W boson, neutron, proton, electron, down quark, up quark, charm quark, strange quark, muon, top quark, tau quark, bottom quark, tau neutrino, muon neutrino, and electron neutrino--providing a precise match between theory and measurement in every single case (neutrino masses are currently unknown)--some of which are known to 10 and 11 significant figures. It also gives us precise values for the neutron/electron mass ratio and the proton/electron mass ratio (12 significant figures). Since I can't post math equations or pictures in this discussion, please see https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-theory-which-explains-the-values-of-all-fundamental-physical-constants/answer/Thad-Roberts to see the patterns I'm referring to.",1,2020-03-20 10:43:34,physics
8272,flwr7d,Infinitesimals,"If y=x\^2 (e.q.1), then y+∂y=(x+∂x)\^2 (e.q.2) .If we take y away from e.q.2 and devide by ∂x, we get

∂y/∂x= 2x + ∂x (e.q.3), now as ∂x and ∂y approaches zero we get dy/dx = 2x (e.q.4).

I understand that no matter how small ∂x and ∂x becomes their ratio remains unchanged. However, I do not understand how ∂x on the r.hs. of (e.q.3) becomes zero. No matter how small the value of ∂x becomes, it still is significant if we are to remain consistent. If ∂x and ∂y do become zero, then what does it mean to divide zero by zero? If they do not become zero, then why does ∂x disappear from e.q.3?

What does it mean when a number is infinitesimally small? I have looked around and the most common answer I see is that it is smaller than any assignable number yet bigger than zero. I cannot make sense of infinitesimals, how can a number be smaller than any assignable number and not be zero?

The derivation is based on the number of people that die, as that is the only parameter that is accurately tracked with the current testing shortage.

Assumptions/parameters:
The virus doubles every *td* days. A fraction *x* of infected people dies after *tx* days, while (1-*x*) heal after *th* days. Then we can derive for the number of newly infected people that:

Newly infected people (*I*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*I* = *D/x* \* 2^(*tx/td*)

Total number of infected people (*N*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*N* = D td / (ln(2)*x*) \* 2^(*tx/td*) \* (1-2^(*th/td*))

If we plug in the numbers that are currently floating around (*x~0.01, td~6, th=tx~20*), the formulae approximate to:
*I~1000 D*, 
*N~10000 D*
But feel free to adopt parameters that you feel are more accurate to the specific region you are looking at. As an example, this approximates about 150.000 new Iranian cases today (from 150 deaths), with an infected population at 1.5 million.

While this may not be a pure physics question I do feel that it would be interesting to learn what answers people who have dedicated their lives to the field think. Also with regards to the guidelines before reporting this post for not being based in science. This post is attempting to explore the validity of math and physics.

First some context:

An example of math being discovered and later applied to physics only for it to be a perfect representation.

The Greeks discovered parables by cutting cones in specific ways. Later parables could be graphed. Parables turned out to perfectly represent the path that a projectile follows with regard to gravity. 

Possible example of math not fully lining up as a perfect representation of physics. 

Banach–Tarski paradox, curves having infinite point, y=1/x.

Math with regards to physics:

1) an underlying truth that governs our universe and reality meaning that anything, in reality, can be represented by our mathematical system.

2) a way of thinking that is used to describe and understand our universe but not necessarily a truth. (be kind to me about this one pleas I just learned about fictionalism)

3) a logic prosses that where all things that happen can be explained with but not all mathematical ideas necessarily have to be applicable to existence.

4) If you agree with none of the answers I would love to hear what you think math is with regards to physics. 

Also, I am asking this to better my knowledge. Keep in mind that I am in high school and just started reading about math philosophy.",2,2020-03-17 22:31:07,physics

8378,fkh4oa,PLZ help I think i broke conservation of energy!!!!," So I’m writing a physics paper on how ballistic pendulums react with a change with regards to a change in the projectiles mass keeping everything else constant (yes even the velocity of the projectile). I am analyzing my data with the weight of the projectile on the x axes and the PE of the ballistic pendulum at T/4 (T is period). I know its kina a stupid topic but its all I could come up with. Also I should mention that I am treating this as a SHM problem ie very little calculus. I also wrote a simulation on demos of a SHM that you can change the velocity on. 

Here it is ([https://www.desmos.com/calculator/28ymp0npde](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/28ymp0npde)).

Any way it was all good until I decided to look at the KE of the projectile BEFOR it collided with the ballistic pendulum using the equation KE=.5M1(V)\^2+.5m(v)\^2 (where V is projectile velocity and v is pendulum: v=0 so KE=.5M1(V)\^2). The equation for PE after the collation is 

M= mass of the projectile

m= mass of the pendulum 

PE After collition=PE1=((MV)\^2)/(2(M+m)).

The problem that I am having is that the law of conservation of energy says that the KE0=PE1. If you plug in numbers to both equations this is not true. I cant figure out why. PLZ help!!

8386,fkckqa,BRST symmetry: what does it mean?,"[BRST symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRST_quantization) is discussed in pretty much every introductory QFT class when quantizing gauge theories. It's a global symmetry of gauge theories that involves ghost fields. The conserved, nilpotent BRST charge allows us, via its cohomology, to pick out physically distinct states while modding out the redundant gauge degrees of freedom.

I have several questions about BRST symmetry. To summarize, my issue is that I understand BRST symmetry and cohomology on a superficial level, but I don't understand:

* **How could we have guessed that BRST symmetry exists without knowing about it in advance?**  
* **How do we know there aren't other global symmetries in gauge theories that we don't know about?**  
* **What is the deeper, geometrical meaning of BRST symmetry?**

The textbooks I've consulted so far (Peskin and Schroeder, Schwartz, and Srednicki) seems to pull this symmetry out of thin air. Of course, given the form of the BRST transformation, anyone can check it is a symmetry of the gauge-fixed Lagrangian. But if you just handed me the Lagrangian, how could I have guessed or known that such a symmetry exists, whose cohomology has the desired properties? Where does it come from? And what if there's another global symmetry lurking in there that we're just too dumb to see--is there a way to know that there are no other conserved charges?

I have also heard that BRST symmetry can be understood in a geometrical or topological sense, and it would be nice to learn this perspective.

Any resource recommendations on the topic are appreciated too. I started reading *Quantization of Gauge Theories* by Henneaux and Teitelboim, but it's not easy reading by any means--very abstract and technical. Something a little more concrete would be great.

I was on the fence about whether to post this in the weekly thread. My hope is that by making it a separate post, it'll spawn some nice open-ended discussion of BRST.",5,2020-03-17 15:35:45,physics

8445,fjeo7q,Roger Penrose &amp; Freeman Dyson?,"Hello /r/Physics,
First time poster. I’m not a physics major, but I’ve been heavily interested in physics for about 6 years. 

While I am a neuroscience major, I’ve learned a great deal from many great physicists, e.g., Feynman, Einstein, Hawking, Dirac, Reimann, Hilbert, Nash, Bethe, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, and countless others (mostly quantum). All such interesting people.

However, in light of Freeman Dyson’s recent passing, I could not help but wonder...
Freeman Dyson &amp; Roger Penrose, being so similar in character (contrarians and free-thinking creatives), must have crossed paths. 

Is there any relic of some correspondence between them? A discussion including both of them would be of great value to me, as well as many others I am sure.

According to the above calculation, it seems I am pretty safe. Let’s say someone who’s infected touched his golf ball and the ball left a few viruses on the green.

This synthesis stands as the best match between theory and measurement in science. It is the only theory to accomplish the first 3 of those points and it possesses a far simpler ontology than anything that has come before.

Good morning colleagues




I would enjoy engaging some like-minded folks for a discussion that is I believe of relevance to physics especially relating to obstacles to deeper understanding of modern physics and cosmology.





Should you participate, all of course, willingly - you may get the same interesting insights  - some of which also reflect on concepts such as the meaning of time and even free will.  Keep in mind research such as by John Conway, now alas retired, on how math/physics/philosophy can so intersect.




My challenge is not the math and physics or even philosophy; rather is in understanding where such a discussion can meaningfully take place and so this initial contact.  The discussion is thus Arrived.  To date, I seemed to make errors - posts deleted by mods as is absolutely their right as this is their world and not mine. 




So, I am quite open to all such feedback on how and where for these interesting discussions.  Now, what I am not interested in: egos, bravado, name calling - or any such things.  This intended a spockian world of exploration in logic accompanied by pleasing poetry of thoughts, query and collaboration on ideas.  Helping another, genially.  Fun, games and jokes all aid the conversion, but only if intended non hurtful.  I do not know where such is possible as I don't dive in these waters much other than for the fapping for which this seems marvelous indeed.




Mods: Please, I look forward to your feedback as well, but please as well simply understand: I am serious in this request and thus please direct any constructive conversation to where best initiated on even the fundamental question of where such can occur.  Most importantly, if such is not possible at all here, that information is useful to me, so please, I look forward to any feedback. As such, should you simply delete, my understanding of the void of where such reasoned and constructive conversation cannot occur grows. 





My thanks to all for considering. 

J

*





PS I give below some suggestions on skills that will aid any discussions, not a priori necessary (tho familiarity with these, will ease):





Poetry, simply because 


Baysian logic/choice 


Comfort with contemplation on infinity 


Basic geometric manipulation, limited to d=3 


Simple modular math concepts


Contemplation of concepts in free will/choice


Knowledge on the outstanding physics and cosmological observations/big Qs


Intuitive comfort in Maxwell's fields


Most useful: intuitive understanding of thermodynamics especially M's demon and such 


Finally, as teaser for the biology nerds, like i: as much neurology as you can (but that, a bit separate topic - part II) 


(And finally, as quite the teaser: the view on the way includes that, I believe, in the distance, on the profile of Mt #137;) 





A rather esoteric list, but the more you have, the better as I have traveled the path and know the hurdles and thus have insight I happily share when and as time allows.

&amp;#x200B;

More specifically I want to understand how an inductivity works. 

Given a current in a wire, around the current a magnetic field arround the wire emerges.

This magnetic field contains Energy.

This Energy is used that even if the voltage is turned off, the current can still flow.

The force of the magnetic field opperates in such a way that it generates a voltage which works against the source voltage. (So if the source voltage goes to 0 the genertated voltage ensures that the current is stabilized)

The Background of this Lenz' Rule is Energy concersation

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first Statement in this series of deduction is that magnetic fields emerges if electirc charges (electrones) are moving.

&amp;#x200B;

In our call I hope you can explain me on an atomic Level, if an electrone spins around the protone (core of a hydrogene atom) why does a magnetic field emerge around the Orbit of the electrone?

&amp;#x200B;

I want to understand the force why it spins around the protoe in the first place because after some Research on my own I suppose that this force is the cause of the magnetic field.

I come with a simple question. 

Items to work with

\- 2 identical packets of honey, but one is crystallized solid while the other is still liquid  
\- a coffee machine to dispense hot water  
\- a room temperature environment where each item exists long enough to obtain equilibrium with the temperature

Provided that 1 packet is placed in each mug and each mug is filled up with x ounces of water, will the crystallized honey packet absorb more heat than the non crystallized honey packet since the first is in a more solid state?

I believe I found my answer online, but I wanted to pass it by you guys to get your input. I'm guessing it will take more energy to break down the crystallized bonds.

But when we do the FPI, it never includes paths(information), even for a very short duration, going backward in time,  the worldline of the particle never goes backward in time it always goes forward in time though there are paths which goes outside the light cone.

The beam orthogonal to the hypothetical ether wind is supposedly in such a way, that it would always stay in line with the apparatus, meaning it would move a diagonal line in the direction OPPOSING the ether wind as the apparatus is moving. 

Comparing it with a classical wave, it makes no sense to me. I might oversee some detail, but this is how it looks to me:

When move on a boat through a lake and pat the water next to your boat, the wave would not catch up with your boat, would it? Throwing a ball would work, as it takes on the velocity of the boat. But light back then would be thought as a wave, so why would you make the assumption, that the wave would catch up with the boat?

8599,fhctnd,I had a dream that might make light speed possible,"We've been looking at propulsion as a means of getting somewhere, whether rockets or ion drives. But I don't think that's the answer.

I think the answer is actually gravity. In the dream there were attractors and detractors that would pull a ship towards them, then disengage. Like an electromagnetic motor, but gravity instead of a coil (and the attractors were in a line). More like maglev rail (but again, with gravity).

The problem is knowing how to reverse a gravity field. We know gravity can bend light (in a black hole), so why can't gravity also exceed the speed of light?

It's a hocus pocus theory, but I really think gravity is somehow involved. In the dream, we had a glimpse of a far away planet similar to earth, by using these ""attractor gates"" to send a probe. Then we found a way to get there.

Let's say we create two entangled particles and transport  one to Alice and one to Bob a long distance away. Now the classical argument is, we cannot force a state of the particle so no communication is possible.

My suggestion is: leave Bob's particle alone completely and let Alice measure the particles spin in +z direction over and over again. From what I understand as long as Bob doesn't touch his particles then Alice should get the same result for each measurement due to conservation of angular momentum. So Alice takes note of that.
Bobs measurement would yield the opposite result, but that's not a useful information.

Now they repeat the experiment with another pair of entangled particles, but this time Bob tries to measure the spin in +x direction while Alice tries to reproduce her +z measurements. Since it's not possible to know both spin components at the same time, each new measurement of Alice should give a random result, instead of a result equal to the first one. This would be noticeably different to the first experiment, meaning we have transferred information from B to A.",2,2020-03-11 06:36:00,physics

8666,fglt68,Instantaneous Communication: a thought experiment,"**Introduction**

Information cannot be communicated instantaneously via quantum-entangled particles due to the uncertainty principle, which causes random outcomes.  Perhaps there is a work around for this if the technological difficulties can be overcome.

**Phase I**

Atomic clocks have reached a very high level of accuracy.  Would it be possible to create two atomic clocks from the same group of entangled particles such as a Bose/Einstein condensate, entangled clouds of atoms or even crystals such as time crystals?  

Tests have previously shown that separating two highly accurate atomic clocks by sending one on a trip in an airplane results in different time readouts as predicted by special relativity.  If the entanglement is successful and can be maintained the time readouts of both clocks should remain synchronized.

**Phase II**

Create two sets of entangled particles such that an individual particle can be measured/observed causing its wave function to collapse.  It would not be necessary to determine the quantum state of the particle, only whether or not the wave function has collapsed.

**Phase III**

Create two groups consisting of one of a pair of entangled atomic clocks and ½ of each set of entangled particles.  Move one group relative to the other stationary group such that similarly separated non-entangled clocks would be expected to show different time readouts.  Then read the quantum state of a particle in group one.   The act of observing this particle in group one should result in the collapse of it’s entangled particle in group two.  This would be recorded as a digital ‘1’.  Observations of particles from group two would take place at preset intervals based on the synchronized atomic clocks.  The lack of the collapse of an entangled particle in group two would represent a digital ‘0’. Two sets of entangled particles are to allow for communication in both send and receive directions. 

**Conclusion**

In 1989 the non-communication theorem was proved showing that you can’t send information instantaneously using the collapse of the wave function.  This argument appears to be perfectly correct but perhaps not complete.  The above idea is intended to be a work around to the transfer of information via entangled particles.  General Relativity allows for wormholes in space-time, usually imagined as containing a black hole on each end. The particles in this thought experiment do not transit a wormhole nor is the information contained in the quantum state of the entangled particles important.  Rather the wave function, which exists as if connected through a wormhole, need only be observed to have collapsed or not.  A yes/no answer concerning the status of the wave function read as a digital ’1’ or ‘0’ should avoid violating the non-communication theorem.  The digital information would be processed as with current technology for digital video and audio.  This setup incorporates what Einstein called spooky action at a distance.  cWe need to first maintain the stability of the entangled clocks and entangled particles, then determine when a wave function has collapsed or not, representing a ’1’ or ‘0’ to send normal digital signals anywhere we place our transceiver group.  Time would proceed normally at the communication devices with the connection between them acting instantaneously like a time-hole or time-window.",1,2020-03-10 16:51:13,physics

I am a little unsure about splay states and what their exact definition is. One example of a splay state would be two coupled oscillators which oscillate with the same constant phase velocity around a stable limit cycle with a constant phase difference of Pi (or 180degrees). Other examples would be more oscillators with different phase differences that add up to 2Pi (360 degrees).

Someone mentioned that splay states might be more general, but i am not sure, if that is correct. The only generalization I could think of would be oscillators where I can transform the timeseries of one oscillator into the other by a phase shift transformation AND a shift in time. 

Also: If someone has a good source or article with a straightforward and reliable definition I would greatly appreceate it :)

That's because our professor's notes didn't really help me to get an intuitive grasp at what lagrangian mechanics really is: I mean, I understand concepts such as phase space, variational calculus, differential equations etc but don't really have the intuition or the mental practice to tie it all together.

The thing is that it’s us seeing the effects of a warp in space, but if we are “in space” then why doesn’t it adjust for the warp?

Like if you have a glass surface on a TV and a ball bouncing around the screen, but there’s a warp in the glass: the ball will warp as it passes through the area, but after that it’s back to the normal shape. All interactions with the rest of the screen are normal, not like the warp effect.

If it exists, it's possible that in the early universe it could have picked up some electrons and become neutrally charged (the 'default' version is positively charged). This might allow it to ignore the usual forces that keep matter from passing through other matter, at least as I understand it. In other words, a massive particle that doesn't interact with normal matter—dark matter.

If this (or any other dark matter candidate) is definitively detected, what next?

8748,ffpu6o,Is the C-limit really an obstacle to space exploration? New paper suggests an alien intelligence can hack time dilation to bend the C-limit without breaking it.,"It’s a simple but surprising twist on time dilation. We start with a question :

**What is the bleakest reality to confront an Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI)?**

While it’s hard to predict what an advanced alien technology would be capable of, we do know they are still constrained to the same laws of physics as us.

In those laws, we encounter an *absolute disaster* : **No object can travel faster than the speed of light (the C-limit.)**

Our Milky Way is 100,000 light-years across. If an ETI on the other side sends a message to Earth, they must wait 200,000 years for a potential reply.

To the best of our knowledge, no alien race - no matter how advanced - can beat the C-limit. A few possible solutions to this have been floated, especially a [Wormhole - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole) in space-time. But we’ve never observed one and don’t know if it is possible.

OK, so here comes the twist. There is a way an alien race can cheat the C-limit without breaking it : **Their entire civilization migrates to a reference frame where time goes by much more slowly.**

No wormholes, no new physics - just standard General Relativity. I’ll get to how it’s done in a minute, for now just imagine an alien race can magically slow time on their home world by a factor of 100x.

With the new reference-frame comes a new perspective, and a new possibility : *The speed of light has increased by 100-fold. A round-trip message to Earth takes 2,000 years, not 200,000.*

It is the same for physical exploration. They can travel to Earth and return to their home world where only 2,000 years have elapsed.

While to us they appear slowed by a 100x, their subjective experience is that of surging into the future at 100x speed.

Now the galaxy awaits their exploration.

OK, how would they manage this time dilation ? I go into details in this paper - https://osf.io/me6sf/

To summarize the paper, if you examine various possibilities - you arrive at only one: **The civilization exists in very near orbit to the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at the galaxy’s center.**

This is (the paper argues) really the only place where such a time dilation would be feasible. When we dig into the physics, a number of happy accidents occur that help us to detect such a structure.

**The orbit is very exotic.** It would have to be in the region where no natural satellite can hold orbit, between the Photon Sphere and the Last Stable Orbit.

**The period of the orbit is easy to find.** The paper calculates it (it’s within 1% of the orbital period of the Photon Sphere.)

So. The time-dilation hypothesis offers the following things :

* **It explains the apparent absence of ETI’s : An advanced and curious race would migrate as soon as possible to near orbit around a SMBH.**
* **It suggests where to look : toward the SMBHs at a galaxy’s center (the Milky Way’s is called Sagittarius-A\*).**
* **It suggests how to filter the signal. An SMBH creates enormous radio noise, but a time-dilated civilization has an known orbital period. We can then calculate the expected doppler shift that would result in any signal they emit. The result is much like an FM radio signal that can be detected through the radio noise.**

All this stuff is laid out in detail in the paper which I just finished (Feb 20, 2020), and which I’m anxious for people to read. [https://osf.io/me6sf/](https://osf.io/me6sf/)",17,2020-03-09 00:23:26,physics

All the other portions have pictures but on this one ESSENTIAL step there are no images as a guide and the writing makes absolutely NO sense. I'm hoping one of you might have a better idea since Physics is more your wheel house. The instructions are as follows:

**Procedure**

1. Use a pen or pencil to number the horizontal lines on a notecard 1 - 15. Start with 1 on  
the bottom line and 15 on the red line at the top of the card. Numbering the lines makes it easier to keep track of data.
2. Use the masking tape to tape the notecard to the outside of the box so that the numbered side is facing you, and the left edge of the notecard is flush with a corner.
3. Use the masking tape to tape the protractor to the outside of the box such that the origin of the protractor is located on the corner of the side adjacent to the numbered notecard (Figure 9). The bottom of the protractor will hang lower than the box, with the zero-zero line of the protractor aligned with the bottom edge of the box. Place the box on a table or countertop so the protractor can hang freely beyond the edge of the surface.
4. Create a square frame by unraveling the two large paper clips to form a shape resembling half of a rectangle. Each paper clip will have one short arm and one long arm once you form the half rectangle shape.
5. Use masking tape to form a complete rectangle by placing one short arm of one paper clip to a long arm of the other. Wrap tape around the paper clips where the arms meet (Figure 10).  
***Figure 10: Step 5 reference.***
6. Press the area to the numbered notecard, with the bottom of the wire area resting on the table top. Observe the flux lines visible in the frame when you look at the note card head on. You may need to lower your eyes so that they are level with the note-card lines. You should observe a flux of 15 lines passing through the frame. Record the angle between the lines and the frame in Table 1. Assume the lines are pointed at you. It is important that the area is flat and flush with the notecard. That means this angle is zero degrees as measured from the normal. Since the wire frame is pointing at 90 degrees on the protractor, you’ll have to always subtract your measured value from 90.
7. While keeping the bottom of the frame stationary and resting on the table surface, rotate the top downward until you only observe a flux of 14 lines passing through the area. Again, observe this at eye-level with the #14 line. Do not bend the frame. Record the angle between the field lines and the frame vector in Table 1. Remember to subtract your measured angle from 90.

8. Repeat Step 7 for each remaining flux line until you cannot observe any more lines in the frame.

8786,ffe0u3,"Some Questions about physics, that i tried to answer etc."," 

**Why does time seem to move in one direction?**

Okay so let's consider time to be a force, now what are forces? A force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity, i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. Now forces move in all directions as I stated ‘and direction…’, but time is not a force even i said let’s consider it to be one, time is dimension, if time were it would move in different directions. If time were a force time travel would be possible but time is not a force it is a dimension, we can experience many dimensions, we humans have theories of dimensions, we live in a 4 or 5 or even more dimensional world, the forth being time, and fifth being a unity between gravity and electromagnetism to create a theory fundamental forces, now we cant see time, but we can experience it, we age, we grow old. Now that leads us to believe time travels in one direction, but can we prove that? I don't believe we can, what leads us to assume that we can't time travel making time go backwards is our lack of means. We as species do not have the intelligence and the means to prove time moves in one singular direction. If we did have the intelligence and the means we would probably be able either deny that time moves in a singular direction, allowing us to manipulate time to our convenience or we could prove that time in fact can not be manipulated by measly beings such as humans and for us it moves in a singular direction. Now i'm not going to leave this here, I haven’t even covered half a page, most of this “**theory**” is just common knowledge. If time is a dimension why can't we change it? Why can’t we physically interact with time? Our only interaction with time, is it passing by us making us older or are we passing by it? Is time stationary and we are just experiencing its affects or is it passing through us and effecting us directly, does time affect anything else other than what we know? A definition of a dimension is ‘a measurable extent of some kind, such as length, breadth, depth, or height.’ so in every other dimension we can change it some way or the other, correct? The 3 dimensions we occupy on a day to day basis can be changed, how? We can change the length of something, the height, the width, the depth, and the breadth, but we can not change time, why is that? Well as i have stated before we simply do not have the means, to acquire those means we need intelligence, a lot of it, which this time we simply do not possess, and relating this to the answer for ‘Why does time seem to move in one direction’, well to put it simply we currently do not have the means to explain why it seems to move in a singular direction nor we have the means to prove weather if we can manipulate time or not. Currently we think of ourselves as  an advanced species who understand basics the fundamentals of this universe, but we do not understand it, there may be a species long after humans are gone that may be far more intelligent or far more stupid. But for what i think of it is. Time moves in a circular pattern. History repeats itself. Humans before, cavemen would have found artifacts left by a species we do not know of and they perhaps did not possess the knowledge to understand what those artifacts contained, perhaps they contained the answers to the question we have now, or the contained something completely different and the earlier, less intelligent version of our species did not think much of it and disposed of it, and it vanished over time, but some may have been able to understand some of it advancing the human civilization. But all of this depends on an **IF** or a **PERHAPS**, this is my theory, my opinion and if anyone has any additions or anything just tell me, i will sure take that into consideration, and i might even change my opinion on this, who knows. Only **time** will tell.

**Where did all the antimatter go?**

Let's take a look at what antimatter is, so antimatter is molecules formed by atoms consisting of anti-protons, anti-neutrons, and positrons. But stable antimatter does not appear to exist in our universe, so the question should be **‘Where did all the stable antimatter go?’.** Simply put, I do not think we as a species do not have the intelligence and means (as i stated with the previous question) to figure this out. But I believe that we could try to figure this out, I will go on with what i know (know keep in mind i am the furthest thing from a physicist ).

Why would they be faked? For what reason? I don't see any problem with these articles and there are hundreds of separate news stories from different years and news sources (including reputable news sources) of the same type of event.

My friend posted them in a sub to warn people not to sleep in modern cars with the windows rolled up and the vents off because modern cars lack adequate passive air exchange and a person will use up air faster than its replenished, and everyone was downvoting them saying the news articles are all fake. Why?

My friend clarified that cars are not airtight but that doesn't mean that a person can't use up oxygen in the car faster than new oxygen comes into the car.

CO2 poisoning is another factor as well and can kill much quicker than oxygen deprivation can, as well. If there's poor air exchange because modern cars are more tightly sealed than older cars, toxic levels of CO2 could feasibly build up over time.

Are these articles fake or do people generally just not understand physics too well?",0,2020-03-07 22:38:52,physics

Currently I'm deciding on taking an Intro Quantum Mechanics for summer quarter. I have all of the pre-requisites when it comes to math i.e. Calculus 1 - 3, Diff Eq and Matrix Algebra. 

I have also taken Calculus based physics in Community College 3 - 4 years ago, however **I don't remember 95+ % of the material.** Actually, even though it was **calculus based**, we **never** really used it unless for simple harmonic motion and an easy integral **once** for an electricity problem. 

Should I refresh and review my material a**ll the way from the beginning** of Physics to understand it fully so that I'm prepared for the upcoming class in summer? Should I not have to worry about it because the physics material may not be a part of the Intro QM curriculum? What are your thoughts on this?

8807,ff36h1,Feeling down. Big time,"I'm 29. Long story short, I'm Studying for my second degree in physics. My first was in architecture. Didn't feel any passion in it so, I decided to study physics as I always loved how everything works.
It's my second year now and I'm yet to pass any subject. 
Albeit, the program is hard(IPSP, Leipzig, Germany - 3 years where you take Theoretical physics right from 1st semester.. I think this gets you how difficult this program is. Also, grading is done on the final exam only)
Yet, I don't find it that difficult(physics I mean) I love it, and love learning about it but, I'm doing very poorly in exams.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm writing this. This is my 3rd semester and I'm feeling very sad about the results so far(progress is a thing I'm very proud of)
Thought about talking to the community here.. maybe someone is going through what I'm going through too.

Would appreciate advices for exam preparations though.

8808,ff22py,I love making attempts at unifying certain religious messages and beliefs with quantum mechanics and everyday physics. I was half-baked when I wrote this therefore it's kind of all over the place. Wish luck to all of those who embark on this unedited trip down an idea.,"Can subatomic particles/quarks be thought as lines of computer code that are capable of being entangled all the way from a micro to a macro scale? Every time a measurement is made and the wave function collapses this collapse is ""informed"" to all other subatomic particles in the universe. 

Entanglement could also be thought of having a third party included like our consciousness. Each time we make a decision, we associate the different outcomes to either a ""good"" or ""bad"" outcome. If I was God, I would be connected to this part of consciousness to better determine whether someone deserves to go to hell or not;  If our experiences in the universe were to be directly connected with one another as one neural network and adapt to us the same way we adapt to our environment, being able to determine who deserves heaven and who doesn't would ultimately be determined by the decisions and actions we participate in and what we associate them with. 

Ultimately, this thought experiment conforms by all the rules of quantum mechanics and everyday physics. Newton's third law of motion of every action resulting in an equal opposite reaction would be held true by the collapse of the wave function whenever we make a decision. The collapse of the wave function on all associated particles triggers a reaction by all the particles affected by this collapse creating a chain reaction throughout the whole universe that can be thought of as a tick rate. Every time the wave function collapses and the entangled particles settle for a result; the result is recorded in a third entanglement which we can call the memory of the universe. 

The universe as well as us humans is a product of self-learning and adaptation. The further we dig into the most complex rules of quantum mechanics the easier it becomes to understand how the universe has evolved into what it is today and how consciousness and memory are at play. 

If we think of the universe as a simulation and us the participants as the subjects of such; then there must be a reason to our existence. Due to the way our consciousness is entangled to the universe around us, finding or creating a reason to our own existence is entangled to our future and therefore exposes the illusion of free will. 

Accepting that free will doesn't exist and that our existence has a purpose that we have yet to understand is the best way humanity can move forward. We must evolve and throw away everything that we determine is bad for us humans as it as well is bad for the universe; this makes sense due to the way we have consciously given it this value.",0,2020-03-07 15:42:38,physics

The reason I am doing this is getting into the Physics Major, potentially having 2 degrees when I graduate, but also for curiosity as I've been watching some physics lecture / problems and have gained interest (as I never did before since I only took it to supplement my math). 

I do want to say that even though the **Calculus** Physics I took at CC, we **never** used Calculus **albeit** for Simple Harmonic Motion (Physics 3) and an easy integral for an Electricity problem (Physics 2). Would this be somewhat of a problem even if I'm refreshing upon my Physics? 

During this summer quarter I plan on taking Intro to Quantum Mechanics, not the regular series for QM. At my university, they're on two different scales. One is the actual series for upper level undergraduates and then there's the intro class I'm looking into. The pre-requisites are Physics 1 - 3 and Calc 1 - 3.  I am far more knowledgeable on Math so I would strictly focus on studying Physics outside of the classroom. 

My study plan would be to do 3 lectures every single week (45 lectures total according to what we did in my Physics Class via Flipitphysics) Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and maybe even Sunday (as those are the days when I have either 1 or 0 classes) for 2 - 3 hours. If I actually started the plan (with 3 lectures instead of 4 per week) **today and stuck with it** I would actually be done with the curriculum right on the weekend before Summer Quarter starts. 

What resources would I use to understand and review on Physics?

[Michael Van Bizen](https://www.youtube.com/user/ilectureonline/playlists) from [iLectureOnline](http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/PHYSICS). This guy is fantastic and I could focus on his lectures for understanding, but more so on the massive about of videos and problems he has. 

[Flipitphysics](https://www.flipitphysics.com/): I still have all the 3 Physics classes on here with the prelectures, checkpoints and homeworks. I would use this for a more understand or theoretical aspect if needed be, less on the problems (unless if needed be).

&amp;#x200B;

A few things to consider - barbells are circular with weights being loaded on the end of the bar, the sensor cannot be situated on one side  because the weights may not always be pulling on that side so it should be agnostic in the sense the whole arm or area where the plates are loaded  can detect the loaded weight.

8865,fe9rqf,Would the subjective experience of an observer within the event horizon of a Black Hole be different from an observer within the event horizon of a white hole?,"Ok bear with me. If Penrose coordinates are a valid description of the situation, and I am falling into a black hole, and have passed the event horizon, then logically from my reference frame, space has become time like and time has become space like. Or put another way, no matter where I look or whichever 'direction' I travel in 3d space, I am facing a horizon I can never reach where everything is accelerating away from me at an increasing speed and spacetime is stretching and thus 'expanding' infinitesimally fast. Looking back (in 3 dimensions), I can never see my past (as time is now space like). So there is no identifiable 3 dimensional point at which the entry happened, but no matter which direction of travel I move in, in three dimensions, I am always looking at an event horizon that I am inexorably moving towards regardless of where I travel, but I can never reach. Which sounds similar to the cosmological horizon. 

Similarly inside the event horizon of a white hole, time is now space like and vice versa, so I can never travel back into an earlier point, but I can also never catch the information that has come out before me as it is now being carried by an expanding space time faster than the speed of light, creating a cosmological event horizon.",6,2020-03-06 00:59:22,physics

8868,fe8gzp,I have a problem in a high school project on electromagnetism.,"In my project, I am trying to deflect a compass using a current-carrying wire. This requires me to change the current in the wire to obtain diffent data points. For some reason, my school has no resistors. So I tried using Ohm's Law V=RI, where I connected the wire to a power supply on which I can regulate the voltage (Sigmatron 202L), and which also says ""2 A max"". For some reason, the current kept constant at around 1.2 A (measured with a multimeter) no matter the voltage (1.5-10.0 V). I also tried using wires of different radius, which thus have a different resistance, but no change in current either. Btw my compass kept a constant deflection of 32 degrees.

8899,fdurip,"Will deep space travel ever actually be possible? I'm thinking... sadly not. At least, not in the way we imagine.","Please stay with me :) I'm not skilled at condensing my thoughts and I have a tendency to ramble so I will re-edit before posting and thank you in advance if you do make it to the end. 

\-----

I love how when looking at pictures from say, Hubble, that we're actually looking back in time. It's really cool. But it presents to me what I find to be a really interesting problem. 

The thought experiment is based on the following principle. If we do figure out how to traverse space FTL, WHEN do we arrive at our destinations? I think it would *appear* to look like time travel. 

\[start\]

We develop a wormhole/stargate like device. Near instantaneous travel via the theoretically possible worm hole. We open one to Mars and our brave pioneer walks through. Once on the other side he sends a signal to the scientists monitoring. He reopens the gate and goes back through to Earth. The signal is a stand EM sub-light radio signal. 

In theory, he could sit and wait with the other scientists to receive that signal in approx 20 mins time. 

FTL travel would put you at your destination as it is right now, and not how we see it by conventional means. 

\[end\]

Expand that. The nearest star is \~4 light years away. Imagine that as I write this post, it's going supernova. We won't see it for 4 years. However if we could open a wormhole to near that star and send a spaceship through, we would be sending it to its instant death in the throes one of the most powerful explosions known to exist. Even at sublight what we would see when we get there is not what we went to see.  

Expand THAT. We see pictures of Stars, Nebulae etc. We want to visit them, but they're *really* far away. By sublight or by wormhole, what we see when we get there is NOT what we saw that made us want to go. Example, a Nebulae. It could have completely dispersed, or formed stars and left nothing behind, or any number of possibilities. 

The point is, what we see around us is NOT what we would be going out to visit. The further away it is, the more it is likely to have changed. 

With all this in mind, how can extra-solar travel EVER be practical, FTL or not? It could only ever be one way pure exploration. All these possible Earth Like Worlds we're seeing, could be nothing but balls of baron rock by now due to how long their light took to get to us. Any number of things could have caused it. 

This could also explain why we've never met any other technologically advanced species . It's just not actually practical, FTL or not. You receive a signal and go exploring. By the time you get there, they're long gone. Moved on, become extinct, any number of possibilities.

I feel like we are actually somewhat stuck in our own solar system, possibly forever. As our technology increases we can and will undoubtedly move further and further out and will almost certainly find ways to live on planets like Mars, Moons like Titan etc but ultimately, any extra-solar journey is going to be a one way ticket into the unknown. 

We could never *purposely* find a new home outside the solar system and go there, because it almost certainly wouldn't be what we saw when we finally arrived. 

The only future I see for humanity and space travel, are self sustaining/repairable generation ships that have no real destination and simply exist for the journey itself, with no real destination.",0,2020-03-05 06:48:12,physics

This dispersion relation is often described as relating the frequency and wavenumber of phonons.  In actuality, is it more correct to describe this as relating the frequency and wavelength of normal modes (and a phonon being a quantized increase in the vibration amplitude of a normal mode)?  

If this is correct, what does dispersion actually mean when looking at normal modes.  Say I look at a normal mode at the edge of the first brillouin zone.  The group velocity is zero there, yet the phase velocity isn't.  I don't understand how a ""pure"" wave can have differing phase and group velocity since there seems to be no ""group"" to speak of (it's just a single frequency). 

Also, along those lines, I don't understand why people sometimes say that a phonon is a wavepacket, and since the group velocity is zero at the edge of the brillouin zone, it doesn't propagate.

8934,fdhxvz,Travelling in the 4th dimension,"I'm trying to rationalize space travel via 4th dimension for a game concept.  If space is curved, you could move very quickly from one part of space to another along the 4th dimension near where the curves come near each other.  Think of having two points on a curved piece of paper where the 2d travel is along the surface, but 3d travel allows you to pop through to the other side where they touch.

This led to a couple of thought problems.  First, let's imagine the 2d plane is occupied by capitalized letters, O, B, and R.  When O passes through the 3rd dimension in negative Z and arrives on the other side, it is still an O.  When B passes through, it is reversed, but it can simply rotate and still be identical.  R cannot.  When it passes through, it is now reversed and no amount of 2d rotation will correct it.

I'd like to know if there is similar symmetry in 3d such that some objects can pass through 4D fine (a sphere, for instance), but others might be reversed, or turned inside out.  

Secondly, since the 2d character has no concept of the Z axis, how does it know how far to go before it hits the other side of the page and returns to its original plane?  Since Z is 0, aren't there an infinite number of other 2d planes between one side and the other?  Wouldn't this same issue plague 4d travel for us?",1,2020-03-04 13:07:47,physics

I'm not questioning that part. I'm just wondering if it will change the wavelength's Frequency or Amplitude. 

I know that light from a star that's moving away red shifts, and for stars moving closer to me will blue shift. That's where we've got the Big Bang theory, as everything seems to be moving away from us. 

So my question is whether moving very fast (let's assume a space ship, something fancy) will that speed add to the wavelength of the photons, since it can't add to the speed of the photon itself (as light moves as fast as I'm aware it's possible to move)?",5,2020-03-04 12:33:29,physics

But I really didn’t think deeply about that. Now I’m hearing that the antenna length contributes to the frequency emitted. Well,I guess wavelength and frequency are 2 sides of the same coin. And antenna length is associated with wavelength. 

Can anyone clarify this for me? 

I also am very confused with 1/4 and full dipole stuff. I can’t understand how exactly this works. I look at things differently than many people. I don’t like using conventional methods,such as conventional current. I look at em waves as a bunch of photons oscillating in waveform(unless observed according to the double slit experiment,which then they’d be a point particle somehow... I think?) Well I can’t understand that if a photon is the smallest quantum bit of energy at whatever given frequency/wavelength,how does antenna length really relate to that for receiving? Multiple electrons or atoms don’t absorb and share a single photon. Does length have to do with a higher probability that the photon will strike an electron within that region?






Sorry if I sound dumb to you smart folks. I’m not smart at all. Equations will confuse me. I’m genuinely interested in learning how things work without extreme math stuff.

8963,fd9zs0,Crazy thought on event horizon of black holes,"I finally got around to reading Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and I quite enjoyed it, but I have had this thought since reading it.

Since the size of a star is determined by the force pushing out of the nuclear reaction within the star equalling the star’s gravitation pull. As well as other things on the atomic level such as the energy of electrons not being able to escape the nuclear forces, which would make up the size of an atom. 

Could it be plausible to think that when a star collapses to a black hole it creates its own spacetime region within the event horizon, and at the core in its spacetime is negative mass. Since entropy will be decreasing within the black hole which disobeys the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and would make time go backwards.  We cannot see it as it hasn't happened yet, so nothing is there, just a black hole.

Then the event horizon of a black hole is would then be where the force pulling in from its gravitational pull in our spacetime is equal to the force pushing out of the negative mass within the black hole’s spacetime. This interaction would take place in other dimensions, but we would observe the way we do.

In that case you could come up with all sorts of things about the event horizon, such as you cannot cross it in our spacetime. Perhaps when matter collides with it, it annihilates to negative energy within the black hole, or it goes off into imaginary time.

Crazy thought I know, but it keeps popping in my head. Bit of a different take on it than normal thoughts, where light just cannot escape.",5,2020-03-04 02:18:36,physics

He wondered whether time and space were absolute, or whether the principle of invariance of the laws of physics should be paramount.

In 1905, Einstein decided that it is the invariance of the laws of physics that should have the highest status, and postulated the principle of relativity: that all inertial frames are equivalent, the observer’s motion (with constant velocity) is irrelevant, and that all laws of physics should have the same form in all inertial frames.

When combined with electromagnetism, this principle would require that the transformation from one inertial frame to another must have a structure of the Lorentz transformation, meaning that time and space are no longer absolute and change their properties when changing from one inertial frame to another.""

9061,fcenwt,The Fastest Way to Learn Physics.,"  
Hi guys  
   
I’m currently studying physics at a Canadian university. And as everyone here already knows, for any class, be it Physics, there are probably 3 or more 500+ page textbooks on the recommended reading lists.  
   
Whenever I try to learn new concepts in class, I’m struggling because of the sheer load of information that I’m forced to process and organize. Often, new information crosses over with the concepts that I already know and I have to go back to the original text (not fun). A hamster on a spinning wheel.  
   
So,  I’ve been trying to figure out how to study more efficiently, and I think I discovered a fairly popular (but underrated) method. It’s called the Feynman Technique. The Feynman Technique is a super simple yet powerful mental model for learning things quickly.  
   
It has four steps:  
1. Choose the concept to learn  
2. Summarize and organize information into your own language  
3. Share the info with others (Afterwards, review and fill in what you lacked)  
4. Reorganize and Review!  
   
It’s been a few weeks of using it. Had great success with it. The technique does force me to go back to my summaries many times. But because they’re summarized into my own words, I’m able to understand the core fundamentals much more clearly and quickly. Way superior than going back to the original text and translate all the jargon. It’s improved my learning efficiency by at least 30\~40% (not scientific). I’m very excited and planning to use the Feynman Technique for all my courses.

if anyone's experienced this method, what are you doing and how was it?",1,2020-03-02 10:33:38,physics

9135,fbq93p,4-Dimensional Projection onto 3-Dimensional Space," I have a question about dimensional physics. The video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfiFBsKi7go) explains how dimensions are projected onto a world with one less dimension. For example, when a 2D being transitions to a third dimension it can still only perceive two dimensions, the world is simply ""rotated"" to view a different plane. The analogy is applied to 4-dimensional space in the video as well. Now let's consider an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which are predicted by the Schwarzschild solution of the general relativistic field equations. It is commonly believed that Einstein-Rosen bridges are a 4D projection onto 3D spacetime. However, this doesn't jive with the analogy in the video. Most depictions of Einstein-Rosen bridges show two rips in the fabric of spacetime with a ""tunnel"" connecting the two points in spacetime, as can be seen in the first attached image. This appears to be a quasi-1D case where the only directions are through the wormhole or back out of it. If the analogy in the video is true, then this is incorrect. There would be two holes with no ""tunnel"", and a 3D being would still perceive three dimensions (i.e. six degrees of freedom) and would be able to move around in this ""higher dimension"" and then return to normal spacetime through another wormhole, as shown in the second attached image and just like the analogy in the video. The act of traveling through the rip in spacetime is the 3D world being ""rotated"" to view a different plane. Does this make sense?

However, in the case of schrodinger's cat, everyone says that the cat's both dead and alive before we open the box, which has nothing to do with observing particles.

So I always thought that schrodinger's cat was just a fun story for children and people who never studied science, but recently I noticed that professors also say that the cat's both alive and dead before we open the box.

How can particles acting like waves lead to the existence of different worlds before human perception?

Hope this is the right place to ask.

I always hated physics and math in school, and have remained at a pre-calculus level ever since.

Are there any books or online courses (free or paid) which teach you physics alongside the history of the concepts, i.e. how, where, when, why, and by whom they were developed? I'm finding that this really helps make these concepts concrete and much more approachable, which is what I was missing in school.

9184,fb9gf3,Why isn't the why of things emphasized in education pertinent to physics?," 

Students are taught to carry out a procedure for solving a problem but we are virtually never taught why the procedure works. Let me give an example: the problem is to convert decimal to binary, the teacher provides a procedure which gives the binary number, but he never explains why the method worked in the first place. This is the case with everything that is taught in school, I can't help but wonder why this is the case, I feel like knowing why your tools work is as important as knowing how to use them.

I'm really interested in doing research, but what if the tools I use to do research like math, computer science, physics, etc, aren't well understood, how can I be sure that the conclusions I derive are true? I know their true because someone created these tools but how do I know that these tools work? Do I have to just put faith in these tools?

I know I can sit down and try to figure out why these tools work out on my own but it's highly discouraged because you don't get rewarded for it by the education system, it's the same as wasting your time, a person who spends time understanding the tools is at a severe disadvantage to a person who doesn't care as much. It's hard to figure out why somethings work when you are given a deadline. I don't why many things work, albeit I can use them very well. It makes me dubious of the results I produce.

Perhaps in graduate and undergrad studies, they finally explain how all the tools we have been using work? Is that right? If not then isn't this a big issue? why aren't people solving such a big problem? If we aren't taught about the why of the working of our beloved tools, are the researches producing results they cannot be sure of?

&amp;#x200B;

For the books, I would really like it if they were kind of theoretical and also presented challenging problems (or other books that could provide that). I should also mention that I am quite fond of the Dover series. I have looked at *mechanics* by Hartog which seems to be good (I am reading through the first chapter as of writing this to see if I like it or not) and I thoroughly enjoyed working through some of the books by *I.M Gelfand* also published by Dover for math

&amp;#x200B;

My math background consists of nearly all of high school math with only a bit of trigonometry left. But I don't know calculus but I do plan to start learning it in the summer. I also have some experience with proofs and I can do some 1s on very old olympiads.

Bad professor and he is not teaching effectively so I need to learn this on my own. What resources or ways can I prepare myself for this midterm? Half the questions are concepts and half are calculations. The book we use is ""UniversityPhysicsVolume2"" and I dislike it. In fact, are there any good videos out there that I can watch with practice problems? My professor only teaches concepts and we barely do examples and if so, they are also concepts with no numbers but variables. 

**The topics we learn are:**

**""Electric Charge &amp; Coulomb's Law, Electric Field &amp; Dipoles, Electric Flux, and Gauss's Law, Electric Potential, Capacitance &amp; Dielectrics, Current &amp; Resistance, Ohm's Law  &amp; Electric Power, Resistors in Parallel, Series, &amp; RC Circuits, Kirchoff's Rules, and Electromotive Force, Electrical Measuring, and Safety.""**

This is Calculus-based so he throws things with calc, trig, and all of those things but I'm only in Calc 2 right now and I don't like creating my own equations. I like to have a formula sheet just like in high school when they give us one on the AP Physics exams but we don't have any. Also, for Kirchhoff's Rule, he showed us two tricks and the faster trick requires the matrix and I don't know much on that. I have not been taught well on that.

9217,favtue,Simple verifiable explanation of 3 dimensional time,"3 dimensional time is quite simple, it is a logical property of Einstein's time dilation in Special Relativity. If we blow up a balloon we know that it increases in 3 dimensions of space. If we have any two points marked on the balloon then as it inflates their distance in space increases.   If we send information between these two points along the surface then the time it takes for the information to pass between them is increased in direct proportion to the increase in space.
So at the quantum level it is not just the time between ""particles"" that causes time to dilate, it is time within ""particles"" which dilates directly in 3 dimensions. If we have internal networks inside particles then if we send information along these paths again time is dilated in 3 dimensions within particles.

I have located video evidence showing that time is 3 dimensional in 2 separate experiments online Hitachi 1989 and Nebraska Lincoln University 2013. I also provide a new simple experiment setup to triple verify 3 dimensional time which will show particles acting as never before expected by physicists, moving sideways through space and time. Also I explain the equation which solves it. Δt³∝1/ΔxΔp
I am homeless and penniless so I cant get it peer reviewed under open access as all journals want big money and professional physicists likely aren't reading it because it is not peer reviewed.
The important point is this is not the usual open ended theoretical speculation. I have located the evidence and provide a new simpler experiment setup to triple verify it.

While physicists assert the anomaly in the double slit experiment cannot be a wave crest because it works with electrons which are quantized so that would be impossible it is only impossible in one dimensional time. In experiments it appears as a single particle due to the limitations of locality of measurement in three dimensional time.

The crucial point which clarifies the difference between one and 3 dimensional time in the experiments is the number of hits on the wall. If time were one dimensional then every particle fired would leave a mark where every wave crest hits a wall. Where we get the interference pattern there should be 5 wave crests hitting the wall with every particle fired (if there are 5 bands in the interference pattern) because every wave crest from primary and secondary waves will arrive at the wall. They don't though as seen in the videos of the experiments, only one wave crest leaves a mark at only one point in matter that is within the timeband which is set by 1.the source, 2.positions in space and 3.detectors for momentum (positions also acting as detectors for momentum but for the sake of keeping it simple I refer to detectors separate from the positions in the walls). In the classic double slit experiment most of these arrive at the front screen/wall, the subsequent waves pass through the slits and the back wall but not all leave a mark. Just as every point in space may have multiple radio signals passing along the same airwaves only the ones tuned into will be amplified and detectable in our reality. In these experiments that physical amplification happens only when the three variables time, position and momentum are optimal at any point in the field and the mark is left.

My aim is to create a pulsed solenoid  where I concentrate the magnetic field to a sharp point.   Why?  Oh, you know, mad-scientist reasons. 

We all know a solenoid exposed to DC current carrying wire around it has a field somewhat resembling my drawing in (A).   My first thought is that if I modify the solenoid material's shape to something like (B) or (C), I'll be able to concentrate the field flux to a much sharper point than what I can get with (A).  I also know there are limits to what I can achieve with (B) or (C) because at some flux density and material, the field lines ""leak out"" of the sides of the material and do not exit out the intended small circular concentrating point.   

Given the same current, turns, and volume of material:   in a general sense, what would work better as a concentrator?  (B) or (C)?   Something else perhaps?

I also know that in order to maximize the field, I have to give the flux a place to return ""close to"" where it exists to top/north in (B) and (C).    I have some ideas on geometries for this, but I don't know how to visualize the fields for these in-my-mind, arbitrary solids.  As to geometries, I  know how to create solid models and other mesh types in FreeCAD.  Are there any magnetics visualization software that is free to use ( my interest is non-commercial ) which would help me play around with and experiment with various geometries for this purpose, to see field lines exiting/leaking, and select parameters like material ( iron, cobalt iron, etc) , wire turns, current, wire diameter, etc?

9250,fajmjt,"In detail, exactly what happens when a beam of antimatter is fired at a matter target?","I'm aware of the usual commentary on matter-antimatter annihilation. I wanted to push down a couple of levels deeper, as there are some things that don't quite make sense to me.

My perhaps overly-simplified model is that antimatter can be though of as a ""hole"" that can be filled only by the corresponding matter baryon, with the resulting total conversion of the mass into some number of energetic photons.

For the purposes of this discussion, I am going to assume a non-relativistic collision. Of course, given the amount of energy generated, relativity comes into play fairly quickly (though I'm not sure exactly how that matters.)

The problem structure is: one gram of anti-iron, Fe-56 say, is shot at, via magnetic field acceleration and inside a perfect vacuum, a target of, say normal carbon C-12.

Let's look at what happens, picosecond by picosecond (more or less.)

The first few anti-Fe-56 atoms approach the C-12 atoms. The orbiting positrons are directly attracted to the orbiting electrons and annihilate. Photons start going every which way.

The protons in the C-12 nucleus become exposed. They start repelling the remaining positrons still orbiting the anti-iron. First question: won't that cause the ionized anti-iron to bounce away from the C-12 and stop energy production? (I suspect there will just be a small trajectory change, since there's no Pauli exclusion going on -- the anti-iron will just dodge the anti-Fe ion.)

The anti-iron penetrates further into the C-12 layers. The .5MeV gamma rays from the electron-positron annihilations are causing anti-iron and carbon atoms to scatter, but also potentially making it easier for them to combine.

At some point, the nuclei of the anti-iron become fully exposed. Anti-protons from the anti-iron nuclei reach out hungrily for all of the naked carbon nuclei that are now both expanding at nearly the speed of light. Even higher energy gamma rays, at 2GeV, are generated by the annihilating protons and neutrons. Second question: wouldn't the neutrons and anti-neutrons just expand in a cloud? Sure, most of them would convert when the anti-nucleus and nucleus collide, but any anti-neutrons left over would just fly away (there's no electromagnetic force pulling at them.)

Finally, we see an ever expanding cloud of ultra-high energy protons, unreacted C-12 and anti-iron nuclei, and anti-neutrons that rapidly decay into an anti-proton, a positron, and a neutrino of some flavor. Presumably, a fair amount of anti-hydrogen is produced when the anti-protons grab hold of nearby positrons. (Since the anti-neutrons are relativistic, they can travel fairly far, and it's possible no anti-hydrogen will be formed, as the various antiparticles move too far apart.)

Did I miss anything? 

No, this is not a homework question. I wanted to really understand exactly what happens when matter and anti-matter come together, as the general commentary is just ""BOOM!"" . I believe what actually happens is much more nuanced than that.",1,2020-02-27 15:49:19,physics

I thought about a charge at rest in the frame of an elevator accelerating upwards.  This object should emit EM radiation right? So why wouldn't a charge sitting on the surface of a neutron star (or anything else) do the same thing?  

Intuitively, it seems like a charged particle in a stable orbit should be the one emitting radiation, but since orbits are geodesics, shouldn't those orbits be inertial?  Do we consider objects in orbit to accelerating even though they are following a geodesic?

Hopefully this question makes sense lol.  I was thinking the answer should be independant of your frame of reference since power output is a scalar quantity, but I'm not 100% sure about that either.",3,2020-02-27 11:49:40,physics

Please correct me if I'm wrong. I will probably use incorrect terms but I will do by best to be clear:

**These are my starting point**, I hope they are right :D

1. When studying the application of forces on a free body, in case a force is applied in a direction such that there is a component that ""goes through"" the center of mass I get a non-null ""Thrust vector, right?
2. In case I apply a force with at least one components that doesn't go through the center of mass I get a non-null torque, right?
3. In case I have two identical forces F1, F2 (let's say to the right) applied on opposite sides of the **constraining** pivot point P with same distance from it, I get a null net torque. Right?  


F1 ---&gt;  
|  
|  
\[Pivot\]  
|  
|  
F2 ---&gt;

**Now, this is the main question:**

When dealing with the same situation as point 3, in case the body is not anchored down with a pivot and thus it is free to move/rotate an any axis (e.g. a body in space), **I should obtain a Null net torque and the forces sum up into a Thrust vector, right?** How do I calculate this? Should I use some kind of kinetic energy calculation?

9305,f9zrkp,"Is ""left and right"" fundamental in physics or arbitrary?","A mental picture to understand this question is as follows. Imagine an alien spacecraft is on a collision course to crash into Earth and destroy us all.

All the aliens in the craft are dead except one. He is in the cockpit, with no windows, which is a plain white coloured room with two buttons on the wall. If he presses the left button, the ship will accelerate and blow up planet Earth. If he presses the right button the ship will stop moving, and everyone will be saved.

You know he has to press the right button, but he does not know which to press. You are on Earth and have managed to hack into a radio channel to communicate with the alien.

Luckily you are hooked up to a universal voice translator that contains a dictionary of the alien language, so you can talk to him.

But alas, there is a malfunction and the dictionary entries for the words ""left"" and ""right"" have been accidentally erased.

The question is this: are you really doomed, or is there a way you can tell him which button to press?

You are allowed to assume the alien spacecraft has a physics laboratory and that the alien can perform any physics or chemistry experiment you instruct him to do involving polarization, particle physics, radioactive decay, crystal handedness, spin, parity, molecular chirality, etc. Any experiment you can think up, the alien can do in time to save the planet.

Is there an experiment you can make him do that will resolve left and right so that you can then communicate which button to press to save planet Earth?

Is left and right deeply embedded in some physical phenomena, or are they entirely human convention?

\[In case you conclude there is no way to determine left or right, to finish off the puzzle you then need to state what the next best course of action is to get the best probability of saving the planet, but this has nothing to do with ""left and right."" This last part of the question is a simple probability question just for completeness.\]

When the universe enters the [dark era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Ages_of_the_Universe#Dark_Era) and it's riddled in black holes floating around for quintillions of years, does this eventually cause another big bang due to the incredible amount of compression caused by the black holes?

What if everything in a universe's life continually blows up so big that it can't possibly stay together over enough stretch and time? Then what if every particle is eventually gathered into super dense black holes that continually increase in pressure and can't possibly compress any smaller, thus having to explode outward with a tremendous force because it's the only way to go?

I see life reflected in this. Telophase, the final stage in cell division, is like creating something new, then eventually decaying. Even decayed bodies return to the world and associate with other things. What if this is the universe's perpetual behavior due to its very nature of equal and opposite reactions?

9345,f9in7x,(Total physics newb) Can somebody convince me that spacetime/relativity is a thing? I don't think I get it.,"So lately I've been on a streak of researching time dilation, relativity, and some lightspeed travel stuff. I've seen a  couple different examples trying to explain this and I've had issues with nearly all of them. In particular I can't wrap my head around the example of the twins where one flies through space as fast as light and comes back to find their twin much older than them. I understand the time it takes light to travel, and you percieve things farther away as they were before what they actually are now, but actually coming back and the other person being older makes no sense to me. 
Say you're speeding away from a clock, so fast that the motion of the clock seems to slow. Wouldn't the inverse be true as well? You speed towards the clock and the hands appear to move faster, until you're very close to it and it appears more or less accurate to its absolute position in that time?
This whole relativity thing seems to more be observations on how we measure/percieve time, rather than a law based on ""absolute"" time. And spacetime falls apart for me because the ""speed limit"" of the universe being the speed of light seems implausible to me and I don't think an object's velocity can affect time in that way.
If the vast majority of the scientific community accepts this as true, then there's got to be better explanations/examples, at least I'd hope. Then again, only having a casual interest in this probably explains a bit of my trouble.

I’n in a sophomore level Modern Physics class, which for the remainder of the semester will be primarily focused on introductory quantum, as we have wrapped up Special Relativity. The book we are using is Krane, and we are at De Broglie waves. I am very interested in the subject and have been studying out of Shankar since last semester, and am just starting the simple problems in one dimension chapter. I’ve peaked in a bit of griffiths as well. Anyways the instructor has agreed to do an honors project with me, and so right now I am trying to think of ideas for what the “deliverables” are; a final kind of project to turn in. For example it could be like 5-10 page paper on some topic in quantum mechanics. My teacher suggested quantum computing, but im more interested in the fundamental physics, theoretical or experimental, rather than an engineering application. So I guess I just wanted a bit of advice from people who have my scope over the subject and pedagogy. How can I incorporate my book work out of Shankar into some tangible project that coincides with my modern physics class somewhat. If I were to do this by writing a paper on something in quantum ay this undergraduate level what would you suggest? Thanks for reading.",0,2020-02-25 16:11:50,physics

In doing research, I stumbled across a theory that states that **information** *=* **entropy** (however, from what I can tell, it isn't that straight forward). Therefore, the information in our universe is increasing. This could potentially provide evidence in favor of free will, as it would mean that the future state of the universe (and therefore human action) is fundamentally uncertain and unpredictable.

When trying to get to the bottom of this, I get bombarded by a plethora of different ‘types’ of entropies (fine-grained, coarse-grained, shannon entropy), which, on top of the already difficult nature of the subject, makes it almost impossible to make any sense of it at all. For example, I sometimes read that high entropy means low information — which is the polar opposite of what I read elsewhere.

So I thought of an experiment to put holes in aluminum foil, cover those holes in the nanoparticle film (I made one film with a small concentration of silver nanoparticles and the pther with a hogher concentration of silver nanoparticles, the film with a higher concentration of nanoparticles was redder) and left one hole open as a control. Beneath those holes I put beakers of the same size filled with 25 ml of water, then I put a light source( a lamp that heats the surfaces where it is shone) that it was equally distant from all beakers. After 40 mins I checked the water temperature and the film with the highest concentration of silver nanoparticles was heated the most almost by a full degree and the film with the small concentration of silver nanoparticles had the same temperature as the control beaker.

Is it our consciousness which collapses the wave function or the measurement itself?  In principle the result of the measurement could be in a super position before it is observed, am I right? For example, if we carry out a double slit experiment and we measure which slit the electron passes through, we find out that the interference pattern disappears.  If we remove the detectors from the slits the interference pattern is back up again. However, the electron passing through the slits must generate some electric signal through coulomb's force to the edges of the slit. This signal must be in a super position since the electron that generated the signal is also in a super position, right?  Now if we measure the signal but don't look into the results, does the wave function collapse or not? I feel like in this case the wave function has collapsed since this kind of measurement system is too large to appear to be in a super position.  Also it would make no sense that the observation of the results would change the distribution of electrons on the screen.  So when in the observation process does the wave function collapse?",41,2020-02-25 01:38:36,physics

Are we destroying the very material of our own existence in a way that is permanent?  Do those atoms, or what those atoms were made of rework into the cycle of life of atoms or are they just done?  If I burn something I""m moving energy and atoms around but all the atoms, building blocks of existence, do still exist.  

Does nuclear energy, and (CERN) increase entropy in an irreversible way?  Is it something that morally can be argues against or no because its insignificant?  If so mathematically how insignificant?  I only asked that last one because I figured this crowd may just be so inclined to indulge me.

Thus, making the object more massive would add thermal energy.

Could this explanation earn me points? I know that the primary example is that when you have a phase change you increase thermal energy w/o increasing temp. but was wondering if I was somewhat right???",0,2020-02-24 16:29:02,physics

9413,f8x24v,Is my concept of time wrong?,"So just as the question what's north of north is an invalid question, the question of what is before time is also null. It points to the fact that there is an alternate way of viewing time completely, much like there is an alternate way of viewing direction.  north is just a geometric point on a sphere, the big bang is just a point on  a cycle of inevitable energy transfer that fits within a larger framework of dimensionality.

Maybe dark energy is a force propagated in this higher dimensional reality outside the cycle of energy transfer, much like the spinning force of the earth in the north of north pole metaphor. To a being with no knowledge that the earth is a globe, ""north"" would seem like a never ending direction, and calculations of cosmology and velocity would break down due to some unknown centrifugal force.
Is dark energy a consequence of time itself spinning in an arena that is outside all comprehension?",6,2020-02-24 13:58:28,physics
9414,f8vyaw,"I see size as another dimension, by this logic we live in 6 dimensions instead of 4. Am i wrong?","English is not my first language, sorry for any weird wordings. The idea is that zooming in and out can be seen as moving along a different axis than spacial or time based movement. 

Theoretically we can zoom in and out without moving in space or time. This being a movement along a separate dimension speaks to me since in practise we arrive at seemingly different universes completely with seemingly different laws of nature (from galaxies to atomic or quantum level). 

As human we occupy a set space within the size dimension (when zooming in/out when does the area containing the human body stop being able to be classified as a human) similarly to how we exist in an area of time and an area of space (where does the human body stop / where does a human life end)

The argument that we do not know whether we can move along the 'size' axis indefinitely (min of planck length) can also be made about time (before big bang) and space (end of universe). The argument that we cannot wilfully move along its axis (while conserving ourselves), i feel is also insufficient as similarly we are not able to move backwards in time. 

A more far fetched consequence of this could be that: if zooming in on space is moving through the 5th dimension, then zooming in on time can be seen as movement through yet another, 6th, dimension. We know it is possible to zoom in on time as heavy gravity (think interstellar, lightspeed or black holes) slows down time.  

I am not looking for confirmation of being right, im looking for confirmation that i am not wrong (why is it impossible to think that size is another dimension). I do think this view ultimately comes down to ""depending how you look at it"", but if i make clear contradictions / illogical statements i would love to correct my beliefs. 

A more formally formed statement of this would have to do with accepting that existence (or reference to be philosophically correct) is forcefully tied to a reference frame. This implying that it is wrong to be talking about points in space and time, as to our knowledge only areas in space and time can be defined/referenced to/exist.

9416,f8u66e,Should this be in a unit about momentum and energy?,"I didn't think that this fit under the question tab, since I've received a satisfactory answer. My question to r/Physics is your opinion on this question being asked at all:

\-Two friends are at an ice skating rink. The first friend has removed her shoes and places each of them on the right. Her friend, a hockey player, shoots two hockey pucks at the shoes with the same velocity. The first puck immediately comes to rest after hitting the Left shoe. The second puck rebounds after hitting the Right shoe. Which shoe will have the greater speed after the collision?

Correct answer according to (Major Education company): The Right shoe.

(Major Education Company)'s reasoning: The puck which hit the right shoe and rebounded undergoes a greater change in momentum than the puck which hit the left shoe. Therefore, the right shoe must undergo a greater change in momentum. 

If you haven't spotted the issue, the answer implies that kinetic energy was created during the collision. If puck and shoe have the same mass, the final velocity of the left shoe is equal to the initial velocity of the puck. No problem there. On the right shoe, however, there is no way that an incoming puck of velocity V should hit and result in final velocity &gt;V unless there was an explosion or energy otherwise released. The question never states or acknowledges that energy was released.

As far as I know, I was the only (or one of few) students to ask about this question. Is this problem giving students an improper understanding of collisions? What do you think?",11,2020-02-24 10:58:00,physics

Every ""physicist"" I have had a response from has either said ""the front screen is irrelevant"" or personal put downs such as ""you don't understand mathematics"" yet NONE have done what is scientific. Put it to the test. Since May I have found two separate experiments (Hitachi 1989, Nebraska Lincoln University 2013) which show results which CANNOT happen in 1 dimensional time showing I am correct, time is 3 dimensional, it's a fundamental law of nature. Every person I have shown the evidence to has not responded. I have also devised a new simple experiment which would likely take a few hours to setup to triple verify my theory but again NO ONE who calls him/herself a scientist has had the scientific integrity to put it to the test.  When I put my theory onto forums such as this one invariably it gets put into ""speculation"" or ""personal"" threads despite the fact I have 2 ways to test it and already found EVIDENCE in 2 separate experiments  which show this IS science NOT speculation.

Others wont peer review it because I don't have money. When I explain I don't have money they talk about reduced fees which is ridiculous as any fee high or low is impossible when one has no money, zero! living day to day on the streets.

It's a disgrace and a travesty to science. While scientist's like to pat each others backs and tell each other how valuable and intelligent they are, when it comes to something which goes against their dogma they act exactly as the scientists did to Galileo. They refuse to look at the evidence and persecute what upsets their world view.
 
Considering I provide evidence found in 2 separate experiments and explain 2 methods to further prove the theory this is NOT speculation or a personal theory. If this is put into speculation again names will be noted and people/organisations which make money from funding or advertising as they act as gateways to information/discussion for professionals/students/laypeople alike will be held responsible for misrepresenting the facts and holding back science when someone with true scientific integrity is located.

9477,f8b7en,Should one study physics if he/she does not intend to go into academia?,"I've been dealing with this question for a long time now. I think that physics would be (by far) the subject that I enjoy studying most: I love doing physics/math in school and competitions like their olympiads and it appeals to me that in physics you take pure (proof-based) mathematics instead of other courses as you would do in engineering. Whenever I come across any formula without its derivation and proof, I'm kinda unable to do calculations with it. I just have to know, even though it sounds absurd. Besides, the courses of physics just seem way more interesting to me.

I'd obviously be going for a PhD in physics; reserach sounds very exciting and I can imagine very well to pursue it. However, I'd like to apply my knowledge in industry as opposed to academia, i.e. in a company's/startup's R&amp;D department. The topics that currently excite me the most are nuclear energy, quantum computing and medical physics. Companies like Rigetti Computing are mostly made up of physicists and I'm optimistic that the mentioned branches will grow and new ones will come up in the next \~10 years. I just feel like my work can have a greater impact in industry.

So: With the goal in mind to help commercialize physics' discoveries and make them available for the non-academic world, do you think it would make sense to go for physics in college and try to pursue an applied physics PhD (plasma physics, quantum information, med. physics)?

FYI: I'm already studying physics besides going to school, our local university and my school allowed me to do so. Thus my opinion on physics being a better fit for my studies is not just based upon high school physics.",12,2020-02-23 09:54:38,physics

Experiment Introduction:

Combustion tests burning fabric sheets are conducted aboard the ISS (International Space 
Station) using the Microgravity Science Glovebox Facility.
 
The sheets are mounted in a holder
which sandwiches the fabric between two thin stainless-steel frames. The exposed fuel measures 8.5 cm in length and 1.2 or 2.2 cm in width. One short edge of the fuel is not framed, and ignition is achieved 
across the sample on this edge.

A 29-gage Kanthal wire spans the sample and is resistively heated to provide ignition. Typically the igniter resistance is 1 ohm and a current of around 3.7A is supplied for ignition, which occurs within about 2 s. The samples each have their own integral igniter, 
the leads of which are glued flat along the frame to minimize any flow disturbances. The igniter leads 
come off the back of the sample and go to a connector which is plugged in during installation. 

The custom-made fabric (sometimes referred to as SIBAL fabric) is a blend of cotton and 
fiberglass. The threads consist of fibers of cotton and fiberglass which are spun together. A simple 
weave patter is used with a spacing of 60 by 40 threads per inch (inset of Fig. 2). 

The overall area density is 18.0 mg/cm2, with 75% by mass cotton and remainder fiberglass. This fabric was developed with the idea that the fiberglass matrix would be left behind after all the fuel is consumed, so that the sheet would not curl or crack. Either of these geometrical changes could affect the flow significantly and so are undesirable. 

As will be seen later, the flame is very sensitive to small air flow changes in 
microgravity. The samples are burned in the SPICE apparatus which is a small flow duct with a cross-sectional area of 76mm x 76mm. The front window of the duct can be opened so that samples can be installed one at a time. There is a tab with alignment holes on the sample holder which permits
quick and accurate installation onto small rare-earth magnets inside the flow duct.

Samples can be flipped 180 degrees so that the igniter is on the upstream or downstream end of the fuel. In this way, both concurrent-flow and opposed-flow tests can be conducted. The electrical connector is plugged into a socket inside the duct and the wires are tucked into a corner to minimize flow disturbances. 

A variable-speed fan is used to generate air flow speeds from 0 to 40 cm/s. Air speed is the principal 
variable for this experiment.

The flow duct is housed within the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) which provides 
power, imaging, and a level of containment. It is very advantageous that the astronaut can perform 
hands-on operation of the experiment while viewing the flame directly. 

Sometimes the flame is very dim or has features which the camera misses. The astronaut can make observations in real-time to the research team on the ground which is in direct audio and visual communication. The researchers on the ground in turn provide guidance and clarification is being performed while at the same time benefitting 
enormously from the direct involvement of the ISS crew member. After all the appropriate electrical connections are made between the duct and the MSG, the cameras are set up. The cameras provide the bulk of the data for this experiment. 

A digital still camera takes high-resolution pictures through the top window at rate of about one frame per second. A video camera captures the edge view of the flame through the front window at 30 frames per second. There is a character overlay on the video image to display fan setting, flow speed (from a hot-wire anemometer), radiometer output from a wide-angle sensor inside the duct, and time.

After the sample is installed, the MSG volume is sealed and the lights are turned off. The experiment is operated using a control box which is external to the MSG and can adjust flow speed, igniter on/off, and radiometer gain. In addition to the camera views which are available live to both the astronaut and the ground team, the astronaut can look into a port to view the flame directly. Just before the test is initiated, the flow is set to the desired value and the cameras start 
recording. Ignition is turned on and a flame is established within about 2 seconds. The flame spreads across the sample, ultimately consuming all the fuel and then goes out. In some tests, the flow speed is 
changed while the flame is burning to gage its effect. After the flame goes out, the duct is allowed to 
cool and vent for several minutes until the old sample can be removed and a fresh one installed for the 
next test.

9506,f7zojd,I believe one hundred percent that space is a superfluid medium,"Scientists currently don’t believe that space is a superfluid medium but their own observations and experiments show otherwise. Here are some experiments, observations and facts that show that maybe space is indeed a superfluid medium. 
Wave particle duality of all matter and energy -
All scientists believe that every form of matter and energy show wave particle duality, meaning that they behave as a wave as well as a particle. I believe this is a clear indication that maybe they show this duality because they are a part of the space medium. Since this medium is made up of fundamental particles, the matter which is standing wave of this medium and the energy which is traveling wave of this medium, show wave particle duality. Think of it like air and water. Air and water are both mediums that are made up of particles but waves are also being formed in them. So space is also just like these two mediums.
Conversion of matter into energy and vice versa- 
We know that matter can be converted into energy and we also know that energy can also be converted into matter. So is it wrong to assume that maybe it is possible because they are part of something which we have not discovered yet. That is the space medium. Matter which is a standing wave of this superfluid medium can be converted into energy because it is a travelling wave of this medium and vice versa. 
The double slit experiment -
The double slit experiment also proves the existence of a medium as even a single matter particle causes wave interference pattern when travelling through a double slit. I think that this happens because whenever anything moves in the superfluid space medium, waves are formed. Due to this, the waves made by the matter particle, moving through the double slit interferes with each other to make the pattern. Also when this particle is observed this pattern is destroyed because by observation we introduce more waves in the experiment that destroy the neat interference between the waves of a single particle. 
Dark matter and dark energy -
Scientists believe that alongside visible matter, there is also a lot of matter that we don’t see and observe. They call it Dark matter. Also alongside electromagnetic energy, there is a type of energy called dark energy which is responsible for the expansion of the universe, that we currently can’t observe or interact with. I believe these two unknowns are proof of the existence of the superfluid space medium. Dark matter is the medium itself, currently undetected. And dark energy are the waves being formed in this medium, some of which were formed in this medium during the big bang that are still pushing everything away from each other. Also since space medium is currently undetected, all the waves being formed in this medium that are also undetected currently, are considered as dark energy. 
Electromagnetic field and Higgs field
Scientist currently believe that there are two fields that permeates throughout the whole universe. These are called electromagnetic field and Higgs field. Higgs field gives mass to the particles and the electromagnetic field is responsible for energy. I believe that if you replace Higgs field with big space medium particle and electromagnetic field with small space medium particle and just accept that these two make the space medium that permeates throughout the entire universe then it solves all the problems and issues with our current model of Physics.
Solar sail-
   Just like wind sails that are using wind to move a boat, scientists believe that we can make a solar sail that can use sunlight to move a small spaceship. So just like waves of air and water that can push things, we have a very clear example of sunlight, which I believe is a wave of the space medium, pushing objects. Here is an article about it. Solar sails.
Nothing can’t create something 
The existence of the universe itself is the biggest proof that such a medium exists as nothing can’t create something. As scientists have clearly found that even empty space is full of energy. This energy is not coming from nothing but are just waves being formed and travelling in the superfluid space medium. 
        I think all these facts, observations and experiments prove that space is indeed a medium.

They don't sink into the earth because a force diagram would show a counter force such as the earth's crust pushing away from the earth. If these forces were completely balanced with no resonance a person would be stationary in space I believe. What if for some people or objects who knows there was a skew of this force towards gravity. Their muscles would then be resisting the earth. What if then some people the force away from gravity were greater and they were held on the earth from floating away by the atmosphere for example.

Considering this I wondered why the balanced forces acting on the spring would cause all motion to stop. 

Is there a small period in time in which the spring compresses slightly further than the force applied on it would allow (due to the unaccounted for velocity) causing there to be a negative acceleration, decelerating the  velocity of the springs compression to zero, and then accelerating back towards the force that caused the compression. 

Sorry if that was worded badly, to sum it up, when acceleration reaches zero how is it that the velocity manages to decrease?",1,2020-02-21 16:00:42,physics

It's fairly common knowledge that modern vector calculus notation was not around for Maxwell's equations when they were originally written. But how *did* Maxwell's equations originally look, then?

9547,f7htxb,Prius custom carrier hitch (Q about max load on carrier),"I know about [car hitch classes](https://www.stowaway2.com/trailer-hitch-basics). I see most small cars come with a class 1 200 lbs option for the hitch rating at the tongue. If I made a **custom carrier** (custom, reinforced, tank proof!!!) for a car like a Prius (3050 lbs, 135 hp) and I made sure the frame is strong enough and well attached to the car, is there anybody that could help me figure out what's **the maximum weight I could load at the back on a carrier** (say the center of gravity would be be 18-20 inches away from the bumper) **in order to stay safe**.

**Supporting mods done on the car:** I plan **to add air suspensions** to keep the car at the required level off the ground, to ensure the lights don't point up, to accommodate the extra weight and whatnot AND **to add tires with higher weight rating**.

NOTE: **Let's focus on the question - not going away from it. Yes, I want to do this on a small car like a Prius for very specific reasons. I know that an suv/truck would are heavier and work better. Yes, I know that a trailer ""solves"" these questions - if a trailer was my solution, I would have bought a trailer already. I am asking these questions for very specific reasons.**

**( also -There's no problem that you can't throw money at, so let me enjoy my madness - pretty please.)**

For example I have seen people carry 250 lbs (ish) dual/standard motorcycles on their carrier with Prius, Prius C, Yaris. Most claim they have been doing it for a while, that it feels safe and that they haven't encountered any issues; [check the Vegas RoManiac's project for a solid example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osDhUGthvQs&amp;t=) . **Could I aim for carrying 350-400 lbs safely?** Realistically the rear axle would be the ""pivot"" point in case of a bump. Would the car's weight in front of the rear axle (that's maybe 80-90% of the car - at least?) be enough to keep me on the ground safely? In terms of stress on the motor (not accounting for drag, which I plan to keep minimal by having the cargo tucked at the back) that's like having 2-3 passengers in the car; totally reasonable . My only concern is that the cargo is hanging further at the back - which is not common at all, and not sure how to calculate the changes on traction and how the car reacts when hitting small bumps.

Effectively you are changing the structure of the starch strands firstly by boiling and then allowing it to be left alone). I had other ideas but I thought they were impractical and silly, which is something considering I am experimenting with pasta.

9570,f789hj,Water saturation in living space through humidifier,"Don't know if I'm in the right place, please delete if not.

I live in an attic apartment in a very old house (\~400 years old) that was renovated 1/2 year ago. The room height in the middle of the living room is \~4.5 meters. I calculated the volume of the room and came up with \~155m3. This is without the other rooms and will certainly not be 100% correct. Whether I close the doors of the other rooms or not makes practically no difference.

We use a [Venta LW45 CP](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-comfort-plus-airwasher?c=74) humidifier which can humidify 80m2 according to Venta. Venta states that the 80m2 are at 2,5m room height and so it would be 200m2. What exactly humidify means I can not say, but since according to various Internet sites, an air humidity of 40-60% in living rooms is given, I simply take 45% as an assumption.

I assume that the outside air also has an influence on how well a humidifier works. If it has only 30% humidity outside it will be more difficult to reach 45% inside than if it has 60% humidity outside, right?

With only the [Venta LW45 CP](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-comfort-plus-airwasher?c=74) we can reach \~35 humidity in our living room, if I additionally place an older [Venta LW45](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-airwasher?c=74) which can humidify 75m2 according to Venta we can reach \~38%, also an additional [LW25](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw25-airwasher?c=74) which can humidify 40m2 according to Venta increases the humidity to only \~42-45%. The numbers vary, I think it is mainly due to the weather, if it is humid outside then they are higher.

So what can be the problem, does the humidity go away somewhere? Could the massive wooden beams in the roof ""absorb"" the moisture or is it the new plaster walls?

I pour about \~7 litres of water into the two humidifiers every morning and \~5 litres or more in the evening. So every day more than 10 liters of water will evaporate and we still have such dry air, what could be the reason? 1 litre water evaporated is how much % humidity in 155m3?

We have a super modern floor heating system in the apartment which can be controlled by mobile phone. We can make a heating plan and reduce the heat output even when we are not at home. Is it possible that the temperature drop overnight and during the day changes humidity?

Basically my question is whether the amount of water I add daily(\~10 litre) would not bring more than 35-38% into the room?",4,2020-02-21 02:33:49,physics

9573,f76sfz,Noob Weather Balloon Questions(In Essay Form),"Hello there, you wonderful subreddit.
Preface:
I have been interested in weather balloons for a few years but did so in a very casual capacity. Initially, I wanted to construct a balloon with the intention of filming a very high altitude journey(ideally to space). After a while, I realized that there would be extreme difficulty in reaching a ghastly 200 km altitude, recovering the vehicle afterwards and filming all of it successfully. Plus, there are plenty of videos online of high altitude flights, so my interest shifted toward a system of weather balloon assisted model rockets. Specifically in order to attain huge altitudes on the rocket flight, but my attention was still 'aimed' at that 200km boundary. Thus i began looking for the weather balloon with the high altitude rating and found that they came up very short. 
Question:
After a bit of thinking, I figured to myself that i could possibly attach two balloons together, with one being half filled to then extend my range to 150% of the rated altitude. Basically, I know that helium is lighter than air and that filling an airtight balloon with gas which is lighter than air causes the unit(as a whole) to become positively buoyant. As the balloom rises higher in the sky, the buoyant force, as attributed by the pressure differential(in ratio) decreases to the point of eventual stagnation. But before the point of stagnation, due to the nature of helium being less dense than air, the pressure differential simply causes the balloons membrane to rupture. My thinking was that by adding a second balloon which was half full(and not half empty!), the first balloon would rupture just as the second balloons membrane was starting to become pulled tight and that the pressure differential would still he significant enough to provide lift but not enough to cause the second balloon to pop aswell. My concern is that the helium in the second balloon may not provide adequate lift for the vehicle at the proposed high altitude and that it may in fact simply weigh the other balloon down at lower altitudes. My question is basically to see if there is any way that this could work out? Additionally is there chance that it could work with the added stress of a lifting a load in the form of a model rocket launch assembly, camera and GPS?

The final panel is the exception because the wave will collapse, what matters is what a wave/particle is while in flight.

It's either a wave OR a physical particle. It's possible for a wave to make it from point A to B without being measured before the final screen. That's why it shows fringes. You don't get quantum weirdness (Superposition (not talking about superposition of states), Entanglement, Tunneling) events when it's a particle. They don't experience weirdness after decoherence. Only cohered waves are allowed weirdness events.

There is a clear difference of what a particle is with decoherence. I suspect it is classical when decohered and might not be using the wave function. The quantum field is responsible for uncertainty and still has influence on physical particles ..making them wobble.

Measurements done after the fact (hitting the final panel) have no barring on what the particle was in flight.

The quantum field doesn't use time from spacetime. Unobserved quantum waves do not age. This is how the quantum field knows if a state was triggered in the particles life/path before launching it. This is the core of what measurement/observation is.

A particle/wave will be what it is throughout the flight. No Duality.

This is the gateway to the Unified Theory. Physical particles go with GR, Unobserved Quantum Waves go with the Quantum Field. Spacetime is separate from the Quantum Field. There is a quantum/classical boundary around the mass of a virus. Objects above this line are automatically decohered.

Unobserved Matter-Waves do not decay. Also, physical particles (observed) do not tunnel. The math involves a ""retarded"" Schrodinger equation solution with a damping factor that causes the state vector to not be constant. It is an observable, since it is a hermitian operator and its eigenvectors form a basis of the state space. Hooray for dissipative behavior!  The delayed choice quantum eraser also shows the entire path of the particle is known before being launched.

9598,f6vmj2,How do you integrate the offset of the interuption in an interrupted pendulum into the equation to get the time period?,"Hello everyone,

so no one answered my question in r/AskPhysics so I wanted to try my luck over here :) 

&amp;#x200B;

 

So while reading into science experiments done on the moon i came across the unintended SEQ Bay Pendulum that happened during Apollo 14.

Disclaimer I am very sorry for any language mistakes or wrong equation, english is not my first language and i am fairly new to physics as a whole \^\^

So, it is a slight variation of the interrupted pendulum as the pole which 'breaks' the pendulum length, forcing the pendulum onto a smaller radius isn't directly under the pivot point but slightly to the left.

The pendulum length is 1.6 meters at its longest and after hitting the pole it is 0.9 meters long. The pole is placed 0.15 meters to the left and 0.7 meters below the pivot point.

So i only heard about interrupted pendulums once in class so **I think** the pendulums period is calculated with:

T= π \* SQRT(full length/gravity) + π \* SQRT(broken length/gravity)

so as the experiment has happened on the moon g = 1.62m/s² and the peroid T for a NORMAL interrupted pendulum should be:

π \* SQRT(1.6m/(1.62m/s²)) + π \* SQRT(0.9m/(1.62m/s²)) = 5.43s

at least i think so \^\^

**So my question is: How do I integrate the offset to the left of the pole which is 0.15m into the equation? Does it even matter or is it the period time the same as the one of a traditional interrupted pendulum?**

Thank you very much if you can enlighten me :)

&amp;#x200B;

This video inspired my question:  [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpR1CjvCuIk)I know that the time period for could easily be determined by a stopwatch but there has to be a way to calculate it right?

9623,f6p9v6,Looking for Nominator for Nobel Prize in Physics,"We have until September to find someone to nominate this Facebook post for a Nobel Prize in physics for demonstrating that inertial frames of reference contradict the necessary separation of consciousness from matter that constitutes true science and distinguishes it from philosophical speculation and metaphysics, which leaves the international scientific community with just three choices: 1) reconsider all of physics that is based on inertial frames of reference, 2) admit philosophical speculation and metaphysics into the world of science, or 3) effectively dispute the claim. Ignoring it, launching spurious, bitter, and hostile yet plausible but I’ll-considered attacks, or claiming to have thought of it first will not hold water as the simplicity of the argument, it’s widespread, dated, identified and authenticated authorship, its validity, and the fact that a ninth grader could both understand and make the argument will not allow it.

This is the Facebook post that should be nominated for a Nobel Prize: 

The failing or the trick of the physics of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein and their followers lies in the postulation of independent frames of reference. When first conceived or introduced their discoverers or those teachers who teach what they discovered must begin with the example of two conscious observers to illustrate this. Without the conscious observer it doesn’t work. 

It is commonly introduced with one observer bouncing a ball on a train and a stationary observer outside the train considering the distance traversed by the ball as opposed to the distance as seen by the observer bouncing the ball on the train. For the former the distance is fifty feet and for the latter it is negligible. 

This observation is then extended to all objects in space like rocks, trees, or even atoms and subatomic particles which are all taken to have their own inertial frame of reference and the original human observers are now viewed as equally unconscious objects in space for the purposes of mathematical analysis, but that is the trick. It sneaks a consciousness in then treats it as a numerical variable along with rocks and trees and trains to hide it.

The physicists neglected to demonstrate how the objects in space or the previous conscious observers now viewed as objects denuded of consciousness could have any other frame of reference than that of the entire universe. 

The entirety of all frames of reference other than the entire universe are dependent on the imputation of consciousness onto the objects being considered. Rather than having a few bodies denuded of consciousness, they have actually imputed a consciousness onto every object they observe.

The metaphysical projection of the presence of a consciousness on to the objects under consideration is a contradiction to the assumption that the universe does not include consciousness and does not need it to go about its business. Rocks, trees, atoms, and subatomic particles simply play no role in inertial frames of reference. Time and space are of no concern to them whether they are effected by them or not, and without the projection of consciousness into the objects of space, they never operate in frames smaller than the entire universe, and relativity, the constant velocity of light, the linearity of light, space-time, and the curvature of space are nothing more than artifacts of the scientist “sticking his head in matter” and looking around.

In short all theory based on inertial frames of reference is hereby demonstrated to be not science at all, but epistemology, a study of interesting mathematical possibilities. Any predictions made by theses theories must now be recognized as spurious and unfounded and forthwith rescinded and a search for a new explanation of those predictions begun.

From what I understand we can have DC plasma and AC plasma. 

DC plasma is simple, just take a high voltage source, hook it up to 2 electrode in a low pressure gas tube, and you have a glow discharge. However it has some poor characteristics as well: low plasma density, electrode sputtering, not good for complex chamber geometry, remote plasma, moderate DC cost, etc.

I was thinking, what about RF plasma? I realized that while a scientific RF source would be prohibitively expensive, a relatively high power RF can be obtained from $200 induction lamp ballasts. Induction lamps themselves prove that RF can be used to excite remote plasma. I painstakingly looked up induction lamp power supplies, found one that specified the driving frequency at 2.6 MHz.

Now comes the tricky part: I know this isn't as easy as hooking up a random coil of wire up to the lamp ballasts and sticking it around a tube filled with low pressure gas.

How do I do it? I don't yet know what I don't know. Does number of turns matter much? are commercial supplies optimized so much for Hg that they won't excite say, air? What about impedance matching, which commercial plasma sources use? 

How come I see YouTube videos of people with random looking coils of wire produce plasma?",4,2020-02-19 19:42:23,physics

I have seen / heard several people mention that holding on to the bars while walking on the treadmill will yield less calories being burned vs not holding on to the bars. While I have not done this very often in my training, I became very curious to the truth value of this statement. Having taken a couple basic Physics 1 and 2 courses, along with our friend google, I could not come to a conclusion nor way to calculate the work / energy needed to walk on a treadmill, while holding or not holding bars. Would the energy not be the same, just distributed differently on the body / treadmill?

Thus, more to the point. Is there a way to calculate the difference for calories burned or energy required for each, even if its theoretical under some ideal conditions? Moreover, if there is a difference, is it negligible?

9692,f607vk,What part of my reasoning with regard to the measurement problem is wrong?,"Here is my theoretical experiment to solve the measurement problem. Which obviously shouldn't work because it's simple and I'm not a genius. And if it would work it would have been done already and it wouldnt be an open problem. Anyhow, this is it:


1. Set up the double slit experiment with light and have one observer look at the screen. 

2. He should see an interference pattern.

3. Now place a measuring device at both slits to measure the photons going through each slit. 

4. If you turn on the measuring device but don't log and store the data there should be two possible outcomes:
- the interference pattern stays
- the interference patttern dissapears. In this case the problem is solved. Just the physical interaction of the apparatus with the photons causes the collapse of the wave function. Whether or not the information of the measurement is accessible is irrelevant.

5. If it doesn't dissapear we can extend the experiment.

6. Now we can play with the data stream from the measurement device. If we display it on a screen and look at the data then the interference should dissapear right? But what if we delay the stream of information. Or encrypt it and destroy the encryption key. What would happen then? By playing with this stream of info we could perfectly identify the exact place and act that causes the collapse.

After getting expelled from uni my first time for poor grades, I buckled up and was readmitted when I was 22 ish for biomedical physics. This time I didn't mess about. I finished the degree, and continued on to the master's. I finished my [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) and all of my CAMPEP required courses (CAMPEP is to get accepted into a medical physics residency). Right away, I've moved into the PhD where I'm fortunate enough to work with a very prestigious PI who happens to be an MD/PhD at a massive cancer centre in canada. Everything is shaping out to be awesome right? not so much...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about 3 months into the PhD now, and I'm starting to question my decision. My supervisor insists that we are present 9-5 everyday. With my stipend, I make about $10/hr (minimum wage is \~$14/hr) and live in Toronto. During the [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) I used to have time to do other stuff, tutor, go to the gym, sleep in, skip a day, etc so it made the low pay somewhat bearable. But now... I'm not sure...

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I'm 28, engaged, and ready to move forward with next steps (kids etc) but I don't want to do it with slave wages and take on that kind of responsibility. During the last 6 or so years, I've also really mastered cooking. I don't want to toot my own horn, but I've heard from countless people that I should open a restaurant some day.  I've even made a menu. Of course opening a restaurant is no easy feat. I know it requires extremely hard work (perhaps even more than the PhD) but at least it's something that I could be proud of. Something I built from the ground up.  

&amp;#x200B;

After the PhD is finished, I would have to do a two years residency, then I could work as a medical physicist. That's still 6 years away. I'm not sure what to do. It's like... I've already come half way down this path, but is the right decision to keep going or to change paths. Anyways, what would you do? Should I give the PhD another 6 months or so to see if things improve?

I have pretty much never worked with signals like this up to now, but I know they're fairly common in some other sectors of physics (I seem to remember seeing similar data in astrophysics?), I just don't even know the jargon therefore it's a bit tricky to find the information. 

Also, note that these peaks are quite rare, and the solution should be as computationally efficient as possible due to practical limitations.

However I was lucky enough to have an excellent science teacher who managed (despite my parents asserting that it was all rubbish and I shouldn’t pay attention to it at all) to convince me of the value of critical, analytical and evidence based thinking! 

Unfortunately for my parents their religion didn’t hold up well under that sort of scrutiny! This happened about 16 years old and left me with an incomplete education, lacking the grades to further it. I still had a keen interest in physics and the stars but couldn’t really do anything about it. 

Fast forward nearly 18 years of dead end jobs and not knowing what direction to take my life and I’ve rediscovered the amazement of the universe and how it works, through tv and podcasts of people like Brian Cox and Neil deGrasse Tyson! I can’t get enough! So after some time I’ve come to realise that this is something I would like to study properly. I don’t know if I’m smart enough to do so, but I want to try! I have a head for maths and did really well at GCSE maths and alright at physics (for someone who was told not to bother)

So my question is where should I start? I don’t have the qualifications for university at the moment so I would need to sort that out if that was the destination. Is that the best way? Or am I trying to live a pipe dream?

If you traveled towards Betelgeuse at say half the speed of light (I know it’s unreasonably fast), would the progression of time be faster versus if you traveled away from it at the same speed?

I know that skylight polarisation is due to Rayleigh scattering in the sky. And from wikipedia : “While all scattered light is polarized to some extent, light is highly polarized at a scattering angle of 90° from the light source...The degree of polarization first increases with increasing distance from the sun, and then decreases away from the sun. Thus, the maximum degree of polarization occurs in a circular band 90° from the sun.” 
The particles in the atmosphere, at increasing distance from the sun and also at decreasing distance of the sun could scatter light at 90 degrees (apart from other angles) giving high polarised light.

If the universe is infinite (many of them think that this is the case), then this infinite universe must contain every possible configuration. In other words, anything/everything that you think, exits in the universe. For instance, they will argue that their is a monkey in the universe who is currently writing Shakespeare.

I understand their argument from a philosophical outlook, but I have an objection.

I think their wrong, but I know that in actuality, I am wrong in thinking that their wrong; therefore, I am seeking clarity from someone who has a firm grasp on this concept.

Here is my hiccup:

Why can't the universe be infinitely novel and unpredictable? The quantum physicist says, well infinity contains EVERYTHING, but they use the word ""contain,"" and this word stems from a finite paradigm.

I understand how the infinite universe is infinitely novel, but I do not understand how it is predictable. Assuming a monkey is writing Shakespeare assumes predictive power. Again, the assumption is derived from the following proposition, ""infinity contains everything, even the predictable."" When you use the word, ""contain,"" then you conceptualize universe as a box, hence the finite paradigm.

I entered a Strongman competition where I have to do a 273kg (600lb) basket deadlift event. I know that the weight I'm going to be pulling isn't going to be exactly 273kg because of Physics stuff, so I was wondering if I could get some help calculating the actual force I need to be able to generate to lift the basket, and what the equivalent of that would be on just a regular barbell deadlift! Here's a picture of the implement and some clarifications. 

* Assume I will be pulling straight up on the 1.25"" CR Round Bar, which is 120"" away
* The hinge is the 1.25"" Heim Joints w/SQ Weld-in Bungs
* Assume the weight is evenly distributed in the basket, I'd say the center mass of the basket is roughly 48"" from the hinge

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the questions I had:

1. How much force do I need to generate to move the basket up?
2. What is the equivalent of that force in kgs or lbs to a standard barbell deadlift...basically what would I need to be able to do on a regular barbell in order to lift the basket.

I have a shed roughly 14x6 metres which will be covered in solar panels, as in as many as can be squeezed on safely, but first it needs a new metal roof. The inside temperature of the shed is not the greatest concern, the production efficiency of the panels is. The ideal temperature for the panels is 25°C or less, in practical terms where I live that means keeping them as cool as possible is the goal due to the warm local climate.

The roof installer suggested fitting insulation, which sounded similar to sarking at the same time the roof was done. Basically it is quite thin insulation with a foil layer which will sit a few inches below the metal roof. It seems like a great price (only about $200-$300 extra) and will no doubt create a more comfortable shed. 

My first thought was that it will make the underside of the roof hotter and therefore the roof itself will be hotter meaning hotter solar panels and less production. I mentioned this to him and he said it won't change anything on the roof as it is already in the direct sunlight and you can't get any hotter tun that. I do trust my gut on this one as I believe it will create a heat/solar gain effect on the metal roof itself, but at the same time appreciate that this guy gets on roofs for a living so would have a lot of practical experience. It is also an intriguing thought, that it's already so hot that it won't get much hotter from some warm air underneath.

What do you think? Will the heat gain effect immediately under the roof make any real difference to the temperature overall compared to not having insulation and the heat radiating into a larger area. To make matters more complicated half of the shed is open on the side and the other have is fully enclosed.",0,2020-02-15 22:21:26,physics

2. When friction opposes the motion of two objects it transforms their kinetic energy into heat. Heat is always kinetic.

This is not a homework, it's something I do as a hobby.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to implement Variational Quantum Monte Carlo for molecules. If successful, it will become an open source project.

Of course, I started first with simple trial functions and brute force Metropolis, but I quickly switched to Fokker-Planck/Langevin approach.

At first, I went with a simple atom, but my goal is to have something generic for molecules, so I switched to better trial functions, Slater determinants with Jastrow factor. For now, no optimizations whatsoever, so it's still quite slow. Some theory is presented here: [http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics2/doc/pub/vmc/html/vmc-bs.html](http://compphysics.github.io/ComputationalPhysics2/doc/pub/vmc/html/vmc-bs.html) It contains at the end the optimizations needed to speed up the code, but those will come out later.

For the better trial function, I started out with code from an old project of mine that implements Hartee-Fock: [https://github.com/aromanro/HartreeFock](https://github.com/aromanro/HartreeFock) I took from there the basis sets loading along with the classes for orbitals and shells and so on (of course, there will be some additions like code that computes gradient &amp; laplacian). The code uses STO3G and STO6G basis sets (it should be able to use some other STOnG as well), those are in the sto3g.txt and sto6g.txt files.

As a quick description for those orbitals in the basis sets, they are organized on 'shells' which contain 'orbitals'. For example the Li atom, has an 1S orbital in the first shell and a 2S and three 2P (Px, Py, Pz) orbitals in the second shell. Each orbital is composed of n Gaussians (3 for STO3G).

The Slater determinant is decomposed in two determinants (multiplied together with the Jastrow factor) one for 'spin up', one for 'spin down'.

The problem: There often are more orbitals than electrons ('spin up' or 'spin down'). For the Hartree-Fock that was no issue, since you go with all orbitals in the computations and 'complete/fill' them in the order of the energies. The Slater determinants for the quantum monte carlo approach have a row for each electron and a column for each orbital (the row/column is just a convention). This obviously has to be a square matrix and here is the problem.

Now, if you compute the Li atom and ignore the orbitals that cannot be filled, it's not a problem. The results come out very nicely, since for example for spin up only 1S is used and for spin down, 1S and 2S. Even if for example a single P orbital would be also occupied it would not be a problem for a single atom.

By the way, I already get results with variational quantum monte carlo and STO3G as good as with Hartree-Fock with STO6G, which is quite nice.

But if it's a molecule, it does matter which Ps (and so on, for all of them that are not spherically symmetric) are picked up for the involved atoms.

The obvious and probably correct solution would be to use instead of a single determinant, a linear combination of them, having the last column changed to have in it each of the remaining orbitals. The coefficients would be variational parameters (a lot of them for a molecule!).

This would complicate the code quite a bit and it would be probably much slower, so my question is: is there a simpler approach that is 'good enough'?

What I tried, although did not expect good results: Just make the last 'orbital' a linear combination of all remaining orbitals (including the last one, for example for Li it would be composed out of 2S, 2Px, 2Py and 2Pz). It's just a trial wavefunction, right?

Well, that attempt failed miserably: I get for Li something like -201 eV with the 'normal' method, but by doing the above it gets to something like -150 eV. Worse than I even expected.",10,2020-02-15 03:20:35,physics

I have a very limited understanding of well, everything, but I know that a black hole is created when a star ""collapses"" In on itself. So here's the thing I want to know, does anyone know of any link (mathematically or conceptually) between the ""spike-wave"" and black hole creation? The spike-wave is more or less the exact same amount of energy being pushed towards a single point to produce a ""spike"" that shoots into the air. A black hole is when a star's gravity becomes so great that all at once, in all directions, the star condenses in on itself and forms black holes. I.e an equal amount of energy (gravitational pull) is being applied from all sides (pulling in instead of pushing in) and it creates a ""spike"" in space-time that lasts until it gives off to much hawking radiation.

9907,f3wd7m,"Dampers vs ""Isolators"": Engineering Semantics, or Physically Different Systems?","So I'm in deep with an engineer who insists that an isolator is a physically different animal, but as a physics person I see the same exact mathematics, the only real difference being the damping coefficient with its frequency response cutoff.   


First let me specify that we're talking about a physical mounting system that attaches one part to another, where one of the parts is vibrating and we want to prevent the other part from vibrating as much as possible. We're not talking about a device that's mounted to an object to attenuate its vibration, such as a tuned-mass damper.

&amp;#x200B;

So if you ask the engineer, you'll get something like this:  


\&gt;\*Damping vibration is dissipation of energy. Isolating vibration is the prevention of vibration transmission. A good vibration isolator lowers the natural frequency of a system to below the excitation (or disturbing) frequency. Keeping these two frequencies “out of sync” greatly reduces the problems of vibration. As some in industry define it, common isolators separate the vibration source by flexible slabs that in a definition of the system in dynamic physics act as damper, spring, and mass. Many isolators exhibit some inherent damping, though the latter can degrade their isolation ability by magnifying transmitted vibrational forces. In contrast, a good vibration damper takes mechanical energy out of the system. Properly designed metal springs and rubber mounts can be good isolators but have almost no damping capability.\*

But here's what I'm saying: As long as an isolator has a restoring force, then it's just another damper. The same exact mathematical equation of the driven, damped oscillator will apply. The ""isolator"" just happens to have a different damping coefficient at the frequencies important to the problem. Am I right? 

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind, there's really no such thing as an isolator. if an object was truly isolated from another object, they would simply not be attached to each other with any restoring force. I can imagine a very good isolator, such as a bed of ball bearings where there is a lateral oscillation. An object floating on the bed of ball bearings would still move with the bed if the oscillation was very slow, so we have a very low cutoff frequency and a very low damping coefficient.",6,2020-02-14 12:26:47,physics

My understanding is also that this distribution describes the probability of the position of the photon as a function of time, meaning that the photon's position can be described as being somewhere on a sphere with a radius that depends on the amount of time that has passed since the photon passed the slits. Given this possibly erroneous understanding, my question is this: is the 'thickness' of the sphere describing the position of the photon exactly 0, meaning that the photon is a definite distance from the slits? Or is there some uncertainty to the photon's temporal coordinates as well? 

Unfortunately, I can't think of any double slit analogue that would cause the photon's probabilistic temporal coordinates to self-interfere, but I wonder if that would be possible. I'm imagining that the 'thickness' of the sphere itself would correspond to a probability amplitude, implying that the time at which photons intersect with the detection mechanism itself would vary according to an amplitude.",0,2020-02-13 16:36:11,physics

So I am deciding which physics class I should take over the summer, both are adequate for my major requirement. The elements of physics class says that it is geared towards pre-health professions such as PA which is what I want to do. However, the general physics class says that it is not calculus-based. To be completely honest, I want to choose the class that will cause me the least amount of stress over my summer. Any recommendations? (Believe me when I say that I have asked my advisor about this and have gotten no solid feedback.)

9987,f317do,College,"Hey guys- I'm going to be going towards a physics path in college (next semester I'll be in gen Ed 1st year) and I want to become a physics professor with at minimum a master's in the subject. The reason for my choice is because I really enjoy math and science, being in ap calculus as a senior and having chemistry last year, I really fell in love with this stuff. 

But I have never HONESTLY taken a physics course. Just read a few physics books on phenomenon and space and I find that really interesting. Should I be worried? Am I fit to work towards that goal? I'm just sort of having doubts.

I'm sorry if this post doesn't fit :)",3,2020-02-12 18:31:28,physics

I'm a second-year graduate student at a top 10 university. This quarter I have been taking QFT from a famous professor. Very quickly into the quarter I realized I was hitting a wall. I didn't understand what many of the theorems and ideas being discussed meant. When I tried looking them up I still couldn't get a clear understanding (I've gone down so many wikipedia rabbit holes). It felt like I had missed many courses somewhere that my classmates have already taken. I tried going to the professor's office hours but I just felt so embarrassed that I froze up and broke down in front of him. Then I felt even more embarrassed about that. 

So far I've stuck with the class but the whole thing just makes me feel so inadequate. I find I can't stop thinking about the professor's comments about the ""gaps in my education"" (I guess graduating summa cum laude from my undergrad meant nothing) and ""if you don't enjoy doing these calculations you can always be an experimentalist"" (I do want to be an experimentalist; I guess that makes me a second-class citizen). And I can't stop thinking that this famous person in my field thinks I'm a failure and a nutcase. Why did I ever think I could to particle physics? I'm clearly not cut out for this. Those kinds of thoughts.

I've tried adopting a sort of ""fall off the horse, get back on"" attitude, but it's hard when I feel like I'm falling off the horse every week. I started studying physics because I wanted to get here, studying this topic, and now that I'm here and I just don't get it I feel like I wasted so much time.",9,2020-02-12 18:07:21,physics

Hello,

I am experiencing some difficulty in recreating a topical product’s rheology profile in a lab. I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction here.

The problem is I am attempting to match a rheological profile of a thixotropic method on a rheometer. The product I’m using as a standard has a spike at the low shear rate and then begins to plateau as the shear rate increases. My lab-made batch has the same high shear stress at the high shear rate but it’s shear stress at the low shear rate is much lower. 

I am attempting to find any research on this situation but am struggling to locate anything. Does anyone know of a resource or have experience in this?",6,2020-02-12 17:55:57,physics
