9,if4j9f,Hi all. Question about correct process to do a Petri dish test for presence of mold.,"Hi biology sub. I follow here but don’t post. Always been interested in bio, but life took a different path. 

I am a medical cannabis patient in the state of Florida and I am at a loss as to what is going on with one of my purchases. If you see my history it’s a very recent post. 

There has been a bunch of issues with moldy cannabis lately and I got a uv black light to be safe. 
There is a mold named Botrytis that is rather common in cannabis. It is a type of grey mold. It is not luminescent under uv... so I’m at a loss. 

I purchased a Petri dish test kit from local big box store and am planning on doing a test to see if it is mold or was sprayed with something or if it’s the minerals during growth that were introduced. But I am not sure of the best way to do this. 

1. Should I use a cotton swab? 
2. Should I break off a small piece of material and leave it in the dish? 

I would prefer to do option two. Any advice helps.",0,2020-08-23 09:54:11,biology

35,ievr4n,I would like your thoughts on this,"Hi everyone,

Ever since quarantine began, I’ve been stock trading to make some extra cash on the side, and recently, I’ve gotten pretty heavy into it. Now you might be wondering what that has to do with this sub, so let me tell you just that. 

I invested in a biotech company called IBIO, which has been working along with other companies to aid the world in this Covid race. That being said, their manufacturing process is really interesting and I think it’ll be quite valuable for vaccine creation. Their stock was at $2.00 per share back a few months ago and then it jumped all the way to $7.5 in late July before tanking recently all the way below $2.00. The price first dropped to around $3.00 after the announcement of the Russian vaccine came about, but then it tanked further due to a bearish market that was caused by an insider selling by a shareholder named Dart. The rumors being passed around are that Dart did it for one of two reasons:

1. IBIO can’t receive government funding if they have more than a certain percentage (25% I think) of foreign ownership, and Dart is a foreign owner who had more ownership than that percentage.

2. Dart’s other businesses aren’t performing as well due to the Covid situation, and he potentially wanted to put his funds there to help them recover.

That being said, no other insider selling has occurred since then despite how much the price tanked. So that tells me that these insiders still believe in the upside of the stock and that the downtrend is based on panic selling pretty much.

I’m here because you all have some biological education background and I was wondering what you all think of the work IBIO is doing. I’ve done my own fair of research on the company, but I don’t know much from a biological perspective and would like to hear your opinions in that regard. Is what they’re doing revolutionary? Are there any potential drawbacks to their processes and style of making vaccines? Are the non-Covid vaccines they’re producing of high value, demand, and significance? How feasible are their goals?

If you can please help with this, I would really appreciate it because I thought I was lucky to buy the stock’s first dip post Russian vaccine news, but it tanked further on me, and now I’m kinda stuck bag holding, so I’m somewhat trying to decide if I should hold long term or sell off the shares I have (if there’s no potential in the company’s growth).

Thank you all for the help!",3,2020-08-22 21:49:44,biology

It claims that ""one of the WHO primer sequences in the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is found in all human DNA"".

He argues that the sequence  “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT”, [which he takes from a WHO protocol for detection of SARS-Cov-2](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/real-time-rt-pcr-assays-for-the-detection-of-sars-cov-2-institut-pasteur-paris.pdf?sfvrsn=3662fcb6_2), is also found on Homo sapiens chromosome 8, as one allegedly can see in the bottom of this page [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/NC_000008.11?report=genbank&amp;log$=nuclalign&amp;from=63648346&amp;to=63648363).

42,iesnnd,"Why can women look like soft-featured men, but men can less commonly look like women?","Ok, to start off, I mean no offense to anyone with this question, because I get that it can be a little bit controversial in its nature. But I'm so curious about this and I've wondered for a long time. 

To explain what I mean by the question:   
I am not referring to ALL women and ALL men. Everyone looks different. Some men can look quite soft and naturally less masculine, and some women can have more masculine features, and everyone can be beautiful/handsome in their own way, but I'm talking about most cases of a typical male/female appearance. 

Ok so, I was watching this movie, and it had a woman hiding the fact she was a woman. And it got me thinking. Most women, considering they have no work done (plastic surgery), no makeup, and possibly covering their hair or wearing it short or in a typically masculine style, and covering their body shape (perhaps many layers of clothes) can pretty much look like a soft-featured 'pretty' guy. 

But, most men, even with shaved facial hair, and wearing long hair in a feminine style, feminine clothes, and even with fake breasts, are still obviously men, or at least they don't appear like a woman as convincingly as a woman could appear as a man (in the way I mentioned first). Makeup could adjust the illusion (think of drag queens that appear as convincing women, using contouring etc) but I'd say these count as exceptions.

I was wondering why that was. I imagine the answer is a combination of biological, psychological, and maybe even social/cultural. And again, I mean no disrespect to anybody, whether they are transgender or androgynous or non-binary, or anybody. I'm simply curious about this phenomenon about most men and women, and I'm also wondering if anyone else has experienced this. But please tell me if you think I'm talking bullshit. 

Please let this be a respectful discussion. Thank you",5,2020-08-22 18:17:45,biology

I was investigating how certain organisms are genetically altered  in response to the environment, but I got lost. I was comparing the protein sequences of similar or identical proteins, but I wanted to change the topic a little. I was thinking, theoretically, if a protein is regulated by epigenetic factors, then over time, the sequence should be conserved and if you compare it so similar proteins, there shouldn't be any substantial changes such as deletions or insertions. 

Does that make sense for a hypothesis? 

Like the protein should be conserved over time and the expression of the gene is controlled through environmental factors.

And the research question would be something like 

To what extent is the expression of the protein  controlled by environmental cue?

Only in the past 50 years have women really become equal with men in some aspects although this is mostly concentrated in the west and highly modernized countries. Still, Men and women are more similar than they are different whether its genetically, socially, or psychologically regardless small differences do exist. I came across this TedTalk on Youtube about how same-sex reproduction via stem cells may be one day possible here is the link: [https://youtu.be/k75DToh-ArU](https://youtu.be/k75DToh-ArU). In general, men can conceive both girls and boys since they have XY chromosomes while women can only conceive girls since they have XX chromosomes. If such a technology were to develop in the future it would be revolutionary and destructive in sense to what is considered ""traditional"" but would be interesting nonetheless. Another interesting thing is the fact that both males and females develop as girls first in the womb until 5-6 weeks which is when the SRY gene on the Y chromosome activates and starts the process of male development in fetuses. Here is a quick video on that:[https://youtu.be/z1Kdoja3hlk](https://youtu.be/z1Kdoja3hlk). This made me feel very weird since I am a male but it reminded me that I'm not much different from a woman. Anyways back to the main point of this post which is regarding the impact of the Y chromosome. This really shocked me since the Y chromosomes are very tiny compared to the X chromosome which technically means that men get **slightly more** genes from their mom then they do from their dad's! Either way, the fact that the Y chromosome differentiates men and women despite having only a fraction of genes as the X chromosome is mind-boggling; there are about 200 genes on the Y chromosome while the X chromosome has 900-1,400 genes. This is just awe-inducing to learn that the reason why men are on **average** taller, stronger, faster, etc. also not to mention that hormones do come a long way but the biggest impact is in our genetics. Truly men and women have everything in common except the Y chromosome! Unfortunately, the Y chromosome is also degenerating since unlike the other chromosomes it doesn't recombine. However, that won't be the end of men since humans still reproduce sexually so the SRY gene might migrates to the X chromosome or maybe the Y chromosome will get replaced?

I'm looking for some readings on the philosophy of biology, in particular cell biology. What I'm interested in is an investigation into the concepts we use in cell biology, such as ""molecular interactions"", and mainly **how we conceptualize the cellular landscape** (such as the part-whole relations involved). Also of interest is how we conceptualize the connection between the cellular level and organismic development (ontogeny).

Can anyone point me in a direction? Any philosophers that were interested in this, or any books or articles? Or perhaps any biologists that were interested in the conceptual intricacies involved?

101,ie4kkk,World first solar chain experiment.,"\#David\_Latimar This bottle was planted inside the bottle in 1980 and has never been opened for the last 48 years. As a result, an ecosystem has developed inside this bottle over a long period of time. Which has been defending itself for a long time. This bottle does not exchange anything from the outside. The plant produces oxygen and receives nutrients from the humus in the soil.

The fallen leaves and other parts of the tree fall to the ground and are re-formed into simple matter by bacteria, which breaks down the organic matter and releases carbon dioxide into the air. The steam generated during the percolation process condenses and accumulates in the soil and is reabsorbed by the roots. The result is a water cycle.

Since all the essential elements of the tree are recycled from the tree and the soil, there is no need to supply anything from outside. However, the bottle plant was not sealed at the very beginning.

&amp;#x200B;

Four seeds of Spider Wort were planted in 1980 in a 10 gallon bottle with soil and compost. One of these trees survives. It is sealed and placed in a place full of sunlight. After 12 years, the bottle was opened and sealed permanently with water in 1982.

For the past 48 years it has been completely isolated from the outside world, and for the past 26 years it has been in the same place as Latimer's home. This is a remarkable example of the life cycle on earth.#coppied

# This week in research…

[**Where is That Noise Coming From!?!**](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa668/5893975) **(Open Access)**

Gene expression in cells is “noise-y”. Protein levels vary from one cell to the next, even if those cells are genetically identical and are grown in the same environment. To find the source of this “noise”, the [Bleris lab](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~bleris/) has teased apart “gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level using custom engineered circuits stably integrated in human cells using CRISPR”. The study, published in *Nucleic Acids Research*, shows that most noise comes from transcription.

[**Stable Genetic Circuits in** ](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209584)[***E. coli***](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209584) **(Open Access)**

The [Voigt lab](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) is back, with a new study in *Molecular Systems Biology*. They “designed genomic landing pads in *E. coli* at high-expression sites” that are stable for weeks, without selection. Their integrated circuits also required fourfold less RNA polymerase compared to those same circuits on plasmids.

[**Diagnosing Ebola and Lassa cases in real-time**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17994-9) **(Open Access)**

Viral hemorrhagic fevers demand rapid diagnostics, and CRISPR-based systems are quickly emerging as the victor. A new study, with dozens of contributing labs, shows that Cas13a ([SHERLOCK](https://www.broadinstitute.org/developing-diagnostics-and-treatments/sherlock), specifically) can diagnose Ebola and Lassa viruses with 100% sensitivity. The team even developed a mobile application to quickly report results, and deployed the tech in Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The work was published in *Nature Communications*.

[**Cas13a Detects Small Molecules** ](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa673/5892748)**(Open Access)**

Cas13a is more versatile than you think. In a separate study, Cas13a was modified to quantify the concentration of up to eight samples in a single reaction. [The team](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/bateygroup/), from the University of Colorado at Boulder, thinks that “hundreds of reactions can be easily quantified in a few hours”. The work is out now in *Nucleic Acids Research*.

[**Pow Pow! Knocking Out Herpes Virus in Mice**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17936-5.pdf) **(Open Access)**

The [Jerome lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/jerome/en.html) at the University of Washington has used [meganucleases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganuclease) — a type of restriction enzyme — to eliminate over 90% of latent herpes simplex virus in mice. They delivered the gene-editing proteins via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and found that a “triple AAV serotype combination” works best. The study was published in *Nature Communications*; check out the [press release!](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200818094019.htm)

We are using the COPAN eSwab UTM SARS-CoV-2 Test Kit (green cap) and self-administering shallow nasal swabs under the supervision of a nurse. We are doing this outside during the day under popup tents in Georgia in August. These kits were being stored in individuals cars between testing days but I did get that practice stopped, thankfully. I mean the kits are shipped in insulated bags for a reason! The tube of UTM says keep between 2 and 25º Celcius (77º Fahrenheit). They are then put in a regular cardboard FedEx box and overnighted to Los Angeles (currently experiencing a triple-digit heatwave). So my question is, what are the potential consequences of exceeding temperature guidelines? The lab uses a Hologic Aptima SARS-Cov-2 Assay (Panther System).

I’m a 19 years old student from Poland.
Today I was accepted to an University to the Biology class. 

My dream is to be a virologist ( since 11 ).
I would like to help people by using viruses to cure diseases like cancer etc.

And here I’m a little bit sad/confused because is there any chance to be virologist ? 

I mean in Poland we got another classes like “medic biology,biotechnology, genetic” I wanted to go there (biotechnology) but I was so low in points after “mature exam (something like SAT but not)” and I could only choose biology.

I don’t know is there any chance for me...
I think biology class is too general...any good advices?

229,icl0rc,Constructing an infinitely growing column of microbes?,"So this is a bit of an odd question, I realize, but I thought maybe people have some interesting ideas or precedents...

As so many people, I've gotten into sourdough baking during quarantine, and to do this, you use something called a ""sourdough starter"", which is a stable colony of _Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis_ (which produces lactic and acetic acid which give the bread a sour tang) and a yeast like _Candida humilis_ which produces alcohol (which, after baking, gives the bread a nutty taste) and CO2, which leavens the bread (turning it from a hard, teeth-shattering brick of flour into a delighful sponge of gluten and starch).

The general (if perhaps not very scientific) consensus seems to be that the more often you feed your starter, the more ""active"" it becomes, i.e. the more CO2 it produces in a given span of time, which is important. 

So I was thinking: To keep my starter in peak condition, I'd ideally like to feed it very frequently, say, every hour. Starter is fed with a slurry of water and flour.

So I was imagining some sort of contraption that looks like a chem lab column, where slurry is discarded at the bottom at a constant rate, and new slurry is added at a constant rate at the top. To extract starter for baking, you would open the column in the middle somehow, and extract some of the starter that is going through it's peak growing phase.

But there's a couple practical problems. For instance if the slurry that drops in from the top is pre-mixed, it could get infected by the microbes and start fermenting itself. On the other hand mixing the slurry in-situ seems a bit difficult. The discard valve at the bottom would also be liable to clog up if the slurry is not very well mixed.

Are there any precedents for this kind of thing? I assume when this stuff is done professionally, labs usually use some sort of constant heat oven and just manually switch out the nutrient plates or similar?",2,2020-08-19 05:20:10,biology

However, I'm not sure if I'm cut-out for this type of career. Typical imposter's syndrome. I'm not the best at chemistry and sometimes I feel like my classmates know so much more than me... it's a slight downfall.

&amp;#x200B;

Another option would be to somehow mix my two interests, film and biology. **Any suggestions on how to do this?** Scientific journalism is an option, but doesn't have too many opportunities. This mixing or blending of my majors would be the IDEAL solution, but I'm not sure what careers that would be. (My friends always joke that I should film the next 'Blue Planet' documentary.)

&amp;#x200B;

The last option would be to focus more on a film career. My other passion is photography and cinematography and I could pursue a career in the media world, away from biology. But once again, not sure what I could do.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR- Majoring in biology &amp; film studies, not sure which one to 'choose' or best way to blend the two. Any help or advice from wiser people would be appreciated. Trying to figure out my life some.",3,2020-08-18 20:16:31,biology
247,icdxie,I'm lost,"Hi r/biology. I'm a third year university student. I've recently been accepted to work in a lab focusing on microbiology/immunology and the research, while not the exact type of research I was looking to conduct, is interesting. The issue is two-fold however. 

1. My P.I. speaks very broken English. Almost to the point where I'm losing around 20-30% comprehension every time she speaks. 
2. Research in her lab is largely unstructured and the P.I. does not seem like the mentoring type. I'm not sure how to approach things like poster presentations, writing abstracts, doing statistical analyses, dry lab (computational stuff), etc. 
3. My P.I. blatantly told me during a Zoom meeting that undergraduates don't really make that much progress and that she doesn't expect me to publish or do any work that's substantial. 

So, should I try to find another lab or just try to make this one work? What should a undergraduate Comp. Bio major expect out of undergraduate research?",3,2020-08-18 20:06:59,biology

I threw up so hard that my neck hurt like it was being cut by a machete continuously. after I vomited I sneezed and that just made the pain worse. My eyes were swollen, my face was swollen, I could barely breathe, I couldn't breathe through my nose since both of my nostrils were completely blocked. The doctor told me I had an allergic reaction and to watch out for eggs, omelets, mayo, etc. So I've carefully avoided mayo and omelets all year, up until tonight. Tonight I thought I was brave and ate fries with mayo to see if I had an allergic reaction. Not much really happened, except my tongue was just a bit itchy for a few minutes.

Scientists constructed a phylogenetic tree of modern lizard genera based on DNA sequences, shown below:

Within this group of lizards, several genera have evolved characteristics similar to those found in snakes. One mutation contributed to a diminished external ear in the genera indicated by an asterisk. What is the most recent point at which this mutation most likely occurred?

A. After Aprasia diverged from Paradelma

B. After Lialis diverged from Pletholax

C. When Aprasia and Pletholax last shared a common ancestor

D. When Lialis and Pygopus last shared a common ancestor

E. After Aprasia diverged from Ophidiocephalus

**I said it should be C because the genera Aprasia, Pletholax, and Ophidiocephalus all share the characteristic of a diminished external ear. This is likely a homologous feature that developed in the common ancestry of these species, but my teacher disagrees and says it's A. He said that the mutation leading to this phenotype must have occurred before these branches diverged from acommon ancestor but after they diverged from other groups.**

252,iccf7p,"""The gut feeling"" - where does it come from?","Everyone is familiar with ""something's wrong, I know it"" feeling. Like, that you just know that something is off, and you usually feel very strongly about it. Many of us rely on the ""gut feeling"" when we don't know how to act in a situation.


My question is: what exactly is this ""gut feeling""? Like, more often than not it turns out to be the right one. What is going on in our brain, when on one hand, you have no information on which you can base a particular choice, and on the other hand, you just feel this weird strong feeling about a particular choice. I wonder why that feeling becomes so strong.


For example, even when you're taking a test and there is a question about something that you absolutely forgot to study, and I realized that around 80% of the time the first ""instinctual"" answer that I check is the correct one, and when I come back to revise the test before turning it in, I quite often change the answer to a wrong one, which is why I stopped re-checking the answers before leaving.

The general concepts are all incredibly fascinating to me and I love to study it. The issue is- I am not very good at math. At all. I can do it if I put in the effort, but it has never come ‘naturally’ to me. On standardized tests I never scored high on math. When I switched my major to biology, my counselor looked at my test scores and winced. I went ahead and did it anyway. Maybe you’ll think I’m imprudent for doing this, and maybe I am. But I don’t understand why only ‘geniuses’ and people with high logical intelligence should be restricted to studying science. 

So far in the math courses I have taken, I have been able to get As and Bs. My grades do not falter because of my lack of innate ability. But I am just worried to have a career in biology, one would have to be highly proficient in math. I just don’t know if that is something I will ever be capable of. So I am wondering- is there any hope for me to study this science? Are there careers related to biology I can pursue that aren’t heavily oriented around math? What I want to do is study BIOLOGY, not sit around and do a bunch of math and programming all day. Is this unrealistic of me..?

275,ic0jau,Inflammation from infection but pathogen causes anti-inflammation?," 

Hello, I am studying something about enteropathogenic *E. coli* but first I need to understand how it causes (anti) inflammation.

After reading few papers, I understand that EPEC attenuates inflammation by delivering effector proteins through its Type 3 secretory system (T3SS) into the host cell. These effector proteins then mediate anti-inflammation by preventing phosphorylation of key kinases which ultimately lead to decreased NfKb-activated inflammation.

Now, my confusion lies in whether it does cause net inflammation in the system, or does it not?

1. Don't all infection cause inflammation? Yes, initial EPEC infection might cause inflammation but its effector system lowers this inflammation as an immuno-evasive strategy, right?
2. However, EPEC causes membrane disruption in gut cells which ultimately lead to diarrhea due to ionic imbalance caused by a leaky membrane. Doesn't this by itself cause inflammation?

So I guess, I need validation in my thinking that all these things still cause a NET increase in inflammation versus the uninfected state of host cells, right? (Despite some kind of anti-inflammatory mechanism carried by EPEC)

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, I am learning. Hope you can guide me towards the correct direction and maybe recommend some papers on inflammation and host-pathogen interactions. :)",1,2020-08-18 08:00:12,biology

291,ibvt15,Men Die Younger Than Women Hypothesis,"       On avg the woman lives longer than the man. The long pregnancy and vulnerability of a woman and child cause the man to have a shorter life span, in a reproductive evolutionary take.

       Wouldn’t it make more sense for men to outlive their women counterparts?. The man can fertilize and procreate many at a time, without the dreaded MENopause affecting their capability. So to continue procreating, as much as possible, it is more beneficial for men to live as long as possible - allowing them to spread their seed as much as possible! Especially since an old man can procreate almost as long as they live, while women become capable in their pre-teens til their 40’s (that’s only about 30 years!) Women also must carry a fetus to 9 months (high risk), nurse and care for the baby; thus fractioning the probability of many successful reproductions. The child also gains much independence around the age of 14 (needing the mother’s care up til then, occupying the women, and limiting their number of reproduction). Once the woman can no longer reproduce or care for a child (like in most animal kingdoms), they are less protected and weaker (age) - leading them to be more prone to early death. Whereas, the man would be surrounded by women and children - less likely to die early.
       
         The must-have protection from the male species - that the female species and child need through pregnancy, birth, and years of care - changes the male species’ behavior. The protective behavior will thus cut their lifespan. Therefore, the hunter-gatherer evolutionary step switched the circumstances. 
Male and female species work one-to-one in order to reproduce more successfully. Rather than the males reproducing at high numbers  but with less successful reproduction (more children likely to die due to lack of support and protection). 

         Their is so much more to this than I can type, and so many other tangents/exceptions, so don’t come for me! Lol! 

Remember evolution is happening as we speak! 

Long hypothesis short: men should live longer bc they can reproduce more, but they don’t bc they help protect their children and put themselves in more harm’s way. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY!",9,2020-08-18 01:27:25,biology
292,ibvbkk,"If Cancer is Caused by the Increasing Entropy, Therapeutics That Don't Consume Energy Can Never Fully Cure Cancer","Cancer can be thought of as a disease caused by an inevitable increase in entropy. If our cells are seen as ordered esicles of information, matter, and energy, inevitable disturbances in any one of these systems due to environmental factors or errors in regulation can increase disorder within the cell. The accumulation of these disturbances (i.e. mutations, mitochondrial toxicity, microenvironmental changes) increase disorder within the tissue and create malignancies that form cancer. 

The only way to curb the 2nd law of thermodynamics is to input energy into a system. Entropy can be maintained or reduced by inputing energy into a system. Cancer is a disease caused by an increase in entropy. So a cure to cancer would require using a therapeutic that consumes energy. Small molecules and static biologics do not consume energy. However, living therapeutics like CAR-T cells or gene-circuit based biotherapeutics like the ones being developed by Senti Biosciences do require energy and thus, from a physics standpoint, would seem viable as potential cures to cancer.

Principles of Biology by Robert Brooker with Connect Online Access 3rd edition

I only have found this textbook as an eBook

My college library even stated its not definite I’ll get the book. In other words it will be replaced by a used book instead a new one.

I like reading from the physical book but since I travel every two weeks (because of covid, i see him a little less) to my partner’s home (by train) I’d use my iPad.

This is based on the premise that the carbon in any living thing's body remains the same as long as they consume food, but starts to deteriorate as soon as they die, because they are no longer consuming food.

Here the question: How does a living thing keep this homeostasis of carbon? Maybe to clarify the question, how does the body (of every living thing) know the correct amount of carbon and what mechanisms exist to maintain this balance?",6,2020-08-16 17:21:27,biology

This isn’t all I’ve come across, Stanford’s website does a way better job than most of the other official sites I’ve seen at delivering a better nutritional plan.

It’s a bit absurd that many of the official cancer websites etc talk about how “no diet is good for cancer”, yet tell you to start eating high protein foods.

This is a question/discussion - but more of a curiosity.

I know this isn’t as cut and dry as I make it out to be, and it’s infinitely complex when combined with genetics and tumor type, but this seems to be a promising addition to cancer treatment once figuring out the specifics. 

Maybe tumor pathways responsible for “stealing” the essentials are discovered and inhibited.

361,iauz5l,"Frederick Sanger, British biochemist known for his work with sequences","I may be a few days late but happy belated birthday to Frederick Sanger (b. August 12th 1918). He was British biochemist known to have won the Nobel prize in Chemistry twice, in 1958 and then in 1980, both a recognition for his work on sequences. For his first Nobel prize, Sanger devised a series of brilliant molecular, chromatographic, and ionophoretic methods in order to determine the precise order of amino acids in the polypeptide hormone insulin showing that it consisted of two disulphide-bonded chains of 21 and 30 amino acids respectively, at a time when very few protein chemistry techniques were known. In a work that spanned ten years, he developed the fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) reagent, also known as Sanger's reagent, to react selectively with the N-terminal amino group at one end of the polypeptide chain. Sanger then partially hydrolyzed (broke down via enzyme or HCl) the resulting DNP-protein (Dinitrophenyl protein) into amino acid segments and this yielded free amino acids along with the amino acid labelled with the DNP tag. The technique then involved extracting the acid-stable yellow coloured DNP derivatives with amino groups via paper chromatography. Using proteases to break the peptides into many smaller overlapping fragments, Sanger worked backwards and repeated the steps in order to deduce the entire sequence of insulin. His techniques showed that insulin contains two chains with different end groups. The chains were determined through the use of chromatography. 

Although now obsolete, Sanger's methods were a breakthrough in biochemistry. They laid the foundations behind the construction of the human insulin gene and subsequent use of genetically modified bacteria as a ""factory"" for the production of insulin in the 1970s. Insulin at this point, had only been derived from animals such as cows and pigs and thus presented potential antigenic activity. Sanger's discoveries were also very crucial in that they spurred further identification of many proteins in the ensuing decades. In fact, since Sanger, several thousands of human proteins have been sequenced. 

For his second Nobel prize in 1980, Sanger developed the dideoxy chain sequencing for determining the exact sequence of bases in DNA. Calling it ""the best idea he ever had"", Sanger's chain termination method allowed stretches of 500-800 bases to be read at a time. In this ingenious idea, the region of DNA to be sequenced is denatured in order to produce single-stranded DNA that can act as a template for the synthesis of a new DNA strand. A primer is annealed to the 5' end of the template strand. Radiolabelled dNTPS needed for DNA polymerase to copy DNA and, short for deoxynucleoside triphosphates, are then added to the primer strand along with DNA polymerase which of course is to insert the complementary nucleotides into the nascent DNA strand. Four reactions are set up, each with one ddNTPs (short dideoxynucleoside triphosphate which differ from normal dNTPS in that they lack the 3 ́-hydroxyl group where one nucleotide attached to another to form a chain and terminate chain elongation at a specific base depending on which one of four ddNTPs is used; they effectively prevent the formation of a phosphodiester bond). Nucleotide chains of varying lengths are produced as a result. After electrophoresis of all samples, the band pattern is read to determine the complementary DNA sequence. 

Sanger's work with DNA was instrumental to the Human Genome Project, which helped unlock the genetic code of human life and has remained the basis behind the automated DNA sequencing technologies of today ever since. 

Sanger was indeed one of the most influential biologists of the 20th century and a maker of modern genetics.

""Science is not like the Olympic Games or something where there's a lot of people all trying to win gold medals, and if you don't get a gold medal, you're nothing. There are actually a lot of people working together and contributing to the science — and the science is the important thing."" — Frederick Sanger

""Scientific research is one of the most exciting and rewarding of occupations. It is like a voyage of discovery into unknown lands, seeking not for new territory but for new knowledge. It should appeal to those with a good sense of adventure."" — Frederick Sanger

I recently got my A-level results and I wish to start a career in biology or medicine although I like medicine more. I'm just doubtful that I may not be successful in biology as I'm legally blind. I don't mind  a teaching career because at least I'll be doing what I like at least but I also fear that I can't do that as well because it may involve teaching lab experiments so again I'll be inferior. I like medicine more but in medicine I can't pursue medical school at all because being legally blind will not let me do anything relevant. So, if someone could advise and tell me what is the difference between biology and medicine and whether being legally blind would be like a huge limitation at least in teaching? 

Secondly, I'm planning to go to the Open University, I'm going for this program called Bsc (hons) in biology and it is interim accredited from the Royal Society of Biology in the UK. Will this degree be worth it if I want to pursue a masters in Neuroscience or Human Biology in the UK?

## This week in research…

[**Listening to the Music of a Cell**](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl_a_00325?journalCode=artl)

[Eduardo Reck Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Reck_Miranda) is a professor of computer music at the University of Plymouth. In his latest paper, he introduces “a system for music composition informed by synthetic biology”, in which music is generated via simulations of various cellular processes, including transcription and protein folding. The study was published in *Artificial Life*.

[***E. coli*** ](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30875-8#articleInformation)[**Engineered to Grow Solely on Methanol**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30875-8#articleInformation) *(They must be starving!)*

At UCLA, the [Liao lab](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/liao_lab/) has engineered *E. coli* to utilize methanol as its sole carbon source. With a paltry doubling time of 8.5 hours, the team began by using “metabolic robustness criteria” to engineer the strain, followed by laboratory evolution, and found that the final organism carefully balanced metabolic flux by tuning gene copy numbers and mutating key enzymes. The work was published in *Cell*.

[**Going Deeeep on the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31003-5) **(Open Access)**

[Researchers](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle, have performed a deep-mutational scan on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), the bit that binds to ACE2 on human cells. They created every single amino-acid substitution in the RBD, and show that, while most mutations are deleterious, some mutations enhance affinity for ACE2. The work was published in *Cell*.

[**Boosting Photosynthesis in Plants**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-020-0740-1)

At the University of Essex, the [Raines lab](https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/raine84508/christine-raines) inserted multiple genes, from red algae and cyanobacteria, into *Nicotiana tabacum* (tobacco) to stimulate both electron transport and Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate turnover, increasing photosynthesis. The engineered plants also had an increase in above-ground biomass of up to 52% compared to controls. The study was published in *Nature Plants*. [Read the press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200810113213.htm).

The [Xiao lab](https://xiao.rice.edu/) at Rice University has engineered *E. coli* to both synthesize a 21st amino acid (5-hydroxyl-tryptophan, or 5HTP) and then site-specifically incorporate it into proteins. The team then used the engineered cell to “serve as a living indicator for reactive oxygen species”, as stated by Xiao in a Rice [press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161331.htm). The work was published in *Chem*.

So my question is related to the market in Western Europe and the US.

I’d also like to apologise to the mods; I’m on mobile at the minute and I checked first to see if this breaks the rules and it didn’t seem so but I’m aware that it might.

I was a gifted student throughout high school but I didn’t do well during my entrance exams to university. I managed to get into university but not to a school that I liked and not in a subject I was particularly interested in (clearing is a mess). For various reasons I failed my 2nd and 3rd years and wasn’t  able to get a job in the field I studied.

I’ve always loved science and biology in particular, and the original plan was to study biochem in university. I’m now at a point where I’m thinking about going back and trying again but it’s all so scary mostly because of my age. The average for a biochem course at undergrad level is 3 years and I’ll be 30 next year.

I’m wondering if anybody has any insights into what college/university life is like as a mature student and if you think it’s worth it to try again. I’d also like to know your stories about how you were able to finance it and whether at the end of everything you were able to get a job in the field.

So what do its instincts drive it to do besides eat and sleep? 

I ask this specifically about pets such as amphibians and reptiles as they are presumptively less sentient than dogs and cats. Dogs and cats, I believe (possible very ignorantly), have become purely hedonistic animals due to many years of artificial selection and domestication via humans. But what about an animal like a tortoise? I mean, if it is conscious, does it get bored because it doesn’t need to do anything yet doesn’t have the capacity to really play like a dog or cat? Broadly speaking what does the animal “interpret” the goal of its “existence” to be.

That is quite amazing, every single interaction and synapse between the neurons of C. elegans is known, and it happens that all C. elegans have the same cellular structure.

My question is: Has this neural network ever been simulated and if not, why not? What I mean is this:

When a neuron is stimulated by contact for example, it creates an impulse which will travel along the neural circuitry of the C. elegans quite predictably since the entire network is known. This can be simulated to create a ""simulation worm"". A computer program can simulate the generation of such an impulse and visualize how it would travel along the nervous system. In turn, this impulse will trigger other neurons which control muscles (also fully mapped) and this can result in movement for example. Thus one can create a virtual specimen which would simulate the behavior of a real worm based on certain stimuli (of course not perfectly, and assuming that worms don't have free will).

What are the most reputable/trusted companies that sell cell lines? Are there companies that specialize in different iPSC lines? 

(I will be doing my MSc in Canada, if that makes a difference.)

When there starving at full strength they can only pull only 1250 lbs which is strong but there not as much as the most lifted in recorded history by a human, which is 6270 lbs.

To completely tear off a limb with ease like in 1 second and not slowly like most people who overrate chimps are saying, your actually gonna need over 3552 lbs of force, so can chimp generate that much force. Possibly a gorilla though.

Maybe people are confusing it with chimps ripping the socket of the human arm. Plus people are saying there's no human that's stronger than a chimp. When there's people like dennis rogers who stopped 2 planes for a while with each arm. Same thing with Tommy Heslep who did the exact same thing. If either of them were trained and fighting dirty, they would be able to fight a chimp and beat it.

566,i8bbrl,Will we actually lose or pinky toes because of evolution?,"Hi! First of all I know no biology whatsoever and I'm not an English native speaker so I apologize in advance if something doesn't make sense.

From what I understand, when a species changes, evolves or whatever you want to call it, it is because that change at the time was an advantage over the rest of its species, this is, for example, the typical example of giraffes (giraffes with shorter necks do not reach the food in the trees while longer necked ones do, which causes those with shorter necks to die because they cannot eat while those with long necks live...) if that makes sense.

So, I hear people saying a lot that over time, we will lose or pinky toes because we don't use them anymore, How does this make sense? Why would the species lose a toe if having it or not having it doesn't suppose an advantage over the rest of humans? And also this would mean that to lose this toe first we would  have to have people naturally born without it and those ones to at some point outnumber us who have it. I have also heard people saying that because of how much we use our phones, babies are born now with longer thumbs. This type of reasoning I believe is called Lamarckism and was proved wrong a long time ago, Am I wrong?

There must be something I'm missing, since by this reasoning there's a lot of things in human bodies that we could still have since having them or not doesn't really suppose a big advantage over the rest of the species, for instance, having hair all over our bodies.

So could someone help me understand all this a bit more and where am I completely wrong?",15,2020-08-12 05:28:40,biology

For example, would there be obvious evolutionary advantages, or biochemical or physiological constraints that would force this to be the case?

I realize my question is probably not too clear. One example of what I mean is the renin-angiotensin-aldoesterone system. From what I understand, the initial ""start"" of the pathway begins with the kidneys. Then, after all the steps, the effect also takes place at the kidneys. So then, why couldn't the pathway be much shorter with all the needed molecules being localized in the kidneys?

Another example that comes to my mind is with signal transduction, but at least with that I get that more steps = more chances for amplification and/or regulation. 

So then in general, does involving multiple steps and proteins give the organism a ""finer"" ability to regulate the pathway(s)? Are there other reasons?",4,2020-08-11 23:46:21,biology

Sperm is critical for the fertilisation of almost every living organism on our planet, including humans. To reproduce, human sperm have to swim a distance equivalent to climbing Mount Everest to find the egg. They complete this epic journey simply by wiggling their tail, moving fluid to swim forwards. Though over 50 million sperm will fail to reach the egg – the equivalent to more than six times the entire population of London or New York – it only takes one single sperm in order to fertilise an egg that will eventually become a human being.",0,2020-08-11 20:49:34,biology

Now why would an Octopus with a lifespan of only 4 years develop the capacity to learn so much about its environment, have excellent memory and problem solving skills?.. 

He reasons that octopi must survive to maturity and breed to propagate the species however anything after that first reproduction is simply excess. Since they're quite vulnerable their biology is geared towards an 'all or nothing' breeding event as there is no guarantee any individual survives another year to reproduce again. The species he studies took 4 years to achieve maturity, it breeds, it dies.

What if a combination of our genes that slightly increases our mental facilties also happens to cause dementia in later life. This mutation would be selected due to individuals having a clear advantage in passing on that gene. Natural selection doesn't care about your health between the ages of 40 and 80, as long as you reproduced.

670,i72byk,I can orgasm without being touched at all. How is this possible?,"I’m genuinely curious how my body is able to do this (although not upset 😂), perhaps one of you fine folk has a biological reasoning?

I can orgasm without being touched. I’m a man.

My new girlfriend and I have found (and this is new for me as well) that I can have really strong orgasms, but minutes after I’ve had sex. As I mentioned, I’m a man.

For example, we had a lovely time last night having had sex, I had not orgasmed,  but I was sated and very happy and we were just cuddling in the afterglow.

About three to four minutes after we were just laying and having a nice cuddle, I have these really strong ‘waves’ which make my back arch, and my entire body feel super tingly, it’s feels a lot like a prostate orgasm, as this happens a lot more after anal sex for me. But I wasn’t being sexually stimulated at all, and wasn’t even erect.

I don’t ejaculate during this, but the feelings are utterly incredible. I have normally two or three of those in quick succession, and they are lip bitingly luscious, and I am in raptures.

Afterward my entire skin feels like it’s on red alert, and I super super sensitive to touch.

When my gf and I got together this would happen quite often after she’d pegged me, one time I actually blacked out for 5-10 seconds, she had to check I was still breathing, but that’s much less common now! (Mainly because I have a handle on it!)

I’d love to hear of anyone thought on what’s happening, biologically speaking, or if anyone else has this or not, it would be nice to know I’m not alone! Some of my partners are a bit freaked out as they’ve never seen it before.

I’m a touch older than your normal gentleman on reddit being in my early fourties.

Anyway, hopefully someone else out there has the same, man or woman?

As is the want on Reddit these days, someone is going to call this fake, and it genuinely isn’t, but I have little way to provide it, so think on how you wish...

The desire to eat is literally nearly uncontrollable but my mindset is strong, I honestly used to think not eating at all for a day would be extremely easy but its not , its actually extremely hard because sugar is extremely addictive and everything contrains sugars in some way or another these days .

Its been 26hrs since i last ate , if i dont take the 200 calories from 1 banana at breakfast and 1 banana at lunch into consideration.

I did walk 7 miles yesterday and went swimming in the ocean for abit which probably burned 800 calories at best but dealing with a hangover and the big mood drop and noticeably increased anxiety and mood instability from not eating is definitely extremely challenging, i feel on the verge of crying at this point in the literal sense meaning sometimes i feel like i just wanna cry for no explainable reason or coming close to it .

I get that my dopamine levels are probably extremely low from no sugar intake except for the small amount of natural sugars found in the banana i ate but what biologically is causing me to feel this way? , i dont know if this is the right sub for this question.

I'm asking this because I'm getting very unsatisfied with my actual course at College (gastronomy). When I chose to study this I was very excited, but over time I started to notice that this area isn't really for me and the spark of joy I used to have when learning it has gradually faded.
 Meanwhile I've had an increased interest for biology for quite a while now. I've started gardening in vases for like 2 years now and I just loved staying close to plants, seeing them growing, flowers blooming, fruits appearing, and a bunch of insects forming an ecosystem seemingly out of nowhere. I was so fascinated with how much I was experiencing and learning out of just seeing seeds growing it was almost therapeutic. The last few days I started ""planting"" some shimeji mushrooms and I can't put into words how thrilled I feel every day I go and water the mushrooms and see how life can still grow in a dark, humid place.
I also really enjoy learning about animal and insect behaviour (mostly insects thanks to my boyfriend who loves moths, lately making me have a stupidly big interest for spiders and bees), and also other micro... Creatures overall. I love being on places involved in nature and just look at animals and plants being themselves, seeing how they eat, how they behave to each other etc.

For the past couple months I've been thinking about the idea of studying biology and work in the area (I think it's called a major or something to work at labs and researches), mostly because of my huge interest in nature, and the idea of working with researches and studies, things that I never thought before, just fills me with excitement and the Joy I once had before. 
I'm overall a very, very, VERY chill, calm, and overall an introveted guy, so I guess that contrasts a lot with the work environment of a restaurant, wich is why I've been feeling like it's not for me anymore (I've been working at a restaurant for a year now). 
Anyways, I would like to ask to the fellow biologists and students of the area if you guys think it's worth giving it a go. Do you enjoy what you do? What area should I focus? I would love to know your opinion. I don't know anyone who went to study biology to give me any advices, and since I'm trying to decide what to do I believe the opinion of those who work in the area are extremely important! 

Welp, I guess that's about it. Thanks you so much if you've read until here!

I know that the genetic defect has to be known to be able to design the primers. I also know that for viral infection we then see if there is an amplification, which means that the genetic material of the virus is in our cells. But what about other genetic disorders?  Is it possible to diagnose (for example) sickle cell disease by designing a primer containing a GAG &gt; GTG mutation, and see if there is an hybridization of the primer to the DNA, and then an amplification? Or how does it work? Also, is it possible to diagnose disorders caused by a trinucleotidic expansion like Huntington's disease? What are the limits of the PCR for diagnosis?

I'm 26F, graduated from a tough school with a BA in Bio and Psych. I chose that originally with the goal of med school, but I developed major mental health issues halfway through college and tanked my GPA. At that point, I was so lost on a direction and my family/advisors completely abandoned me, so I graduated with no plan, no meaningful experience, and a GPA that would make grad school quite difficult to get into (3.3). 

I took the first job I could get out of college, harvesting corneas and eyes from organ/tissue donors. I moved up in this field a bit, and now I'm still here, mostly reviewing donors' medical charts and cutting corneal tissue in a lab for transplants. I've mainly stayed here for the same reason I stuck with the bio degree... not sure what else to do. Problem is, it's kind of a dead end field with little opportunity for advancement. Most people in this field go get a second degree in nursing - and I took prereqs for this, but I'm starting to think I would hate being a nurse.

I've considered a few options: 
1) Starting from the ground up, working as a lab tech to gain experience and maybe, if I can ever get in, going for a PhD. 
2) Trying to get a job as a clinical research coordinator (has proven very difficult, very competitive. Only got 1 interview)
3) Would enjoy something regulatory-based given my familiarity with FDA regulations, but not sure where to start with that.
4) Pharma sales - part of my current job involves going to the OR and showing surgeons how to use medical devices, so I wondered if I could use this to get my foot in the door in pharma.
5) saying fuck it, doing something completely unrelated to my degree.

Lately I have been thinking a lot about where I want to steer my career.

I graduated from a cellular biology program at the top university in my home state about 2 years ago. Honestly in college my biology experience was very spread out between all the categories within biology. I got a good taste of multiple categories of biology(ecology/evo, Micro, Cell imaging, Sequencing, and a lot of field work on arthropods, etc). To be honest I found everything biology interesting to the point where I have a hard time imagining what I would like to dedicate further edu and a career towards.

Right out of college I worked as a vaccine manufacturing tech using chicken embryos. The pay was good but the job wasn't for me lol... After that I started working in a medical diagnostics lab focusing on microbiology. I have been working in this lab for about 8 months now and it has been a great experience! I have had the opportunity to learn all sorts of useful microbiology techniques and procedures with my favorite being yeast identification from patients. I really have loved this job in all honesty however I would like to make more money at some point. The pay is low mostly due to where I live according to my research I think.

I plan on going back to school at some point in the next 3 years but I just don't know what kind of program I would want to do yet... And obviously I don't want to jump the gun and choose something that I wish I hadn't later.

Out of all things considered I have been interested in the areas of Micro/Cell/Molecular/Agriculture/Ecology and recently I have started looking into areas like Bioinformatics and Biotech! These last two seem to have the potential to have high pay but I'm not sure if I would want to get out of the wet lab setting...

Anyways! What resources did you use to choose your career path?

### This week in research…

[**Controlling Engineered T-cells with Ultrasound**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00238)

In the latest work from the [Shapiro lab](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, T-cells with engineered heat shock promoters were controlled “[with brief pulses of heat delivered by focused ultrasound](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/),” inducing them to release cytokines and target tumor cells.

[**Automated Genetic Circuit Design for Yeast**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0757-2)

At MIT, the [Voigt lab](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) has constructed nine NOT/NOR gates, with a 400-fold dynamic range, in *S. cerevisiae*. With these gates in hand, they then used Cello 2.0, a software to design genetic circuits, to “build circuits with up to 11 regulatory proteins.” The study could dramatically simplify circuit design for eukaryotic synthetic biology, and was published in *Nature Microbiology*.

[**Automated Cell Culture System with DIY Hardware**](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000794) **(Open Access)**

With some printed circuit boards and off-the-shelf components, costing about $300, a [team at Oxford](http://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/User:Antonis) has created a cell culture automation system with several useful features; the device can measure and record cell growth, and the seven-color LEDs can be used to measure multiple fluorescent proteins in parallel, or for optogenetics. The system, called Chi.Bio, was published in *PLoS Biology*.

For more on this study, [check out my interview](https://medium.com/bioeconomy-xyz/automated-biology-is-now-an-affordable-reality-753684775521) with the lead author, Dr. Harrison Steel.

[**Phase Separation in Human Cells with “Designer” Disordered Proteins**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0511-7)

The [Chilkoti lab](https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/ashutosh-chilkoti) at Duke University has designed a set of artificial, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that can be used to engineer intracellular condensates in living cells. In a new study, published in *Nature Chemistry*, they show that the behavior of the engineered condensates are predictable, and can be tuned by controlling the mass and structure of the IDPs. Chilkoti said in a [Duke press release](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/idp-organelles) that this study “provides very simple engineering principles to program this behavior \[intracellular condensates\] within a cell.”

[**Chemicals Stymie CRISPR Gene Drives**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00117)

At [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), in Seoul, South Korea, the [Kim lab](https://sites.google.com/site/hyongbumkimlab/professor) has developed a chemical method to control CRISPR-based gene drives in *Drosophila* fruit flies. Using a site-specific recombinase induced by a chemical, called RU486, they demonstrate a gene drive removal rate of 7-12% in each generation. The work was published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.

I did well enough to get myself into all honors courses in high school and I know that I have the intelligence, but I also know I don’t have good study habits. Now people tell me college is easier than high school because I know what is expected of me for classes and I have more free time, and also the fact that I will be more driven to study because these are classes going towards the career I’m interested in. I’m just concerned I won’t have what it takes because I’ve also heard a bio major is very difficult. I did very well in biology in high school but terrible in chem. Now none of you can persuade me not to do this because I’m going for it but I’d like to have some tips from those who have graduated and are currently invested in their major. Anything helps.

I’m wondering if there are any types of viruses, fungi, bacteria, etc. that the immune system cannot categorize? 

As in, if virus-Z infects a person, the immune system will know it’s sick, but will react as if the virus is bacteria.

Was reading this article in the Atlantic, and this part stood out to me.

Intentionally made the phrasing of this posts title confusing. 


“There’s a further twist. Normally, the immune system mobilizes different groups of cells and molecules when fighting three broad groups of pathogens: viruses and microbes that invade cells, bacteria and fungi that stay outside cells, and parasitic worms. Only the first of these programs should activate during a viral infection. But Iwasaki’s team recently showed that all three activate in severe COVID-19 cases. “It seems completely random,” she says. In the worst cases, “the immune system almost seems confused as to what it’s supposed to be making.’”

877,i4l8tf,Looking for some help clarifying a few things!,"I would like to preface this with the fact that I am not a biologist, and I'm sure by comparison to most of you I don't know a whole lot. I am a writer, I am working on a short story, and I was some of you could help me with what I'm writing about. If you don't care at all what the story is which my questions relate to, skip the next paragraph. 

THE STORY:  
I won't go into detail and try to keep this as simple as possible: a science fiction story, it takes place in the future, in this future fast food &amp; delivery have taken over to the point where they are the only accessible source of food for the average person. The few companies that run the industry have used genetic manipulation to create crossbred animals (for efficient farming and to breed animals to who's meat taste specific ways for specific dishes). Some of these animals, due to the characteristics they were given, seem to live unpleasant lives. Others seemed quite happy. The story is mostly about the moral implications of creating creatures that live unpleasant lives for the purposes of food and whether that is necessarily worse than creatures living unpleasant lives in a more natural environment/agricultural system. 

THE BIOLOGY QUESTIONS: What I want from the biology people is as much info as possible into what goes into why different animals taste different or may or may not be more efficient to farm? 

Some info I've gathered: (correct me on any of this if I'm wrong)

\-Myoglobin is an important oxygen carrying protein in muscle and it imparts rich/gamey flavours. There is much more of it in red meat than poultry. The parts of poultry with higher myoglobin are the ""dark meat"" portions 

\- many volatile compounds responsible for different flavours are fat soluble - those flavours will be unnoticed if the food cools down and the fat hardens

\- slaughering meat can affect it's flavour, adrenaline and hormones (from fear, etc.) can affect the flavour of meat 

\- when swimming, fish work most of their muscles fairly evenly, so the meat tends to have a pretty consistent flavour and texture throughout a given fish 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway I know this is a bit out of the ordinary and if you can't help me I won't feel slighted.",1,2020-08-05 23:37:48,biology

Los investigadores escanearon muestras de esperma humano con un microscopio 3D y una cámara de alta velocidad, una que podría mantenerse al día con los nadadores rápidos, que pueden manejar de 20 a 30 golpes de natación por segundo.

What I have tried is getting the scientific names (of said animals), obtainining the TAXID from NCBI 'Taxonomy', converting the downloadable XML file into a CSV of which I've put onto google sheets. However, the file is organised by full lineage, which for a simpleton like me is quite difficult to organise. Something simpler more or less like: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species would work.

Other information that would prove invaluable would be visual description, environment, distrubution, life cycle, and endangerement status. But these are just bonuses :)

I am in my mid-30s, had a decently successful PhD at a good school and now work as a postdoc in a large cancer research institute. The decision to go into a postdoc was already made at least partially out of financial necessity, because postdoctoral positions were the only job offers I managed to get post-graduation. But even after several years of postdoctoral work, I am still not able to get any kind of other job offer. And the situation is similar for many of my co-workers. While there is a number of people who still hope to get some kind of faculty position (which is highly unlikely), many of my colleagues are just like me - kind of stuck. 

In my 20s, I used to be extremely passionate about science. But with each passing year, I feel more disillusioned, more hopeless, more desperate. When I was younger, I was under the illusion that money doesn’t matter. But now, I really wish to be able to afford a middle class lifestyle. While my peers have stable careers with clear ways of upwards mobility, houses, cars, retirement savings and enough stability to start a family, I am making 55.000 USD per year in one of the most expensive cities in the country and barely scrape by.

#### [jobRxiv](https://jobrxiv.org) is the free and international job board for scientists, by scientists.

jobRxiv is free and easy to use. Research budgets are often tight, yet other job boards charge hundreds of dollars for each advert. We think your research money can and should be better spent in the lab. We know your time is precious too, so no registration is required and posting a job only takes a minute.

jobRxiv is just for jobs in science. jobRxiv is dedicated entirely to science jobs – this isn’t an add-on to another website as an afterthought. It’s not a general job board where your advert will get drowned in the noise of millions of others.

jobRxiv is for all scientific disciplines, everywhere. Science is interdisciplinary and international, so local or subfield-specific job boards will miss many great candidates. jobRxiv is a one-stop shop for all scientific research jobs.",16,2020-08-02 16:45:41,biology

My question/concern is it was out in the rain, on a cement patio making large circles (1.5’-2’) but also moving in a direction while doing it.
It would stop and scratch and itch itself (using back legs up on back and chewing at front legs) fairly often. It honestly looked like he was taking a bath.

It definitely a strong possibility it could of gotten hurt by the outdoor cat but it didn’t appear obviously injured- he had a little bit of a “sashay” to its walk but was using all four limbs. But if he was injured wouldn’t he had been hiding not out on a cement patio at 11am?

So my questions are: do shrews take baths (similar to a gerbil or chinchilla taking a fist bath)? And can they get rabies (I don’t believe this one had it but just made me think about it)? Is this normal shrew behavior I’ve just never seen before?

Wikipedia says that there are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical, and in chemical synapses, ""electrical activity in the presynaptic neuron is converted (via the activation of [voltage-gated calcium channels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-dependent_calcium_channel)) into the release of a chemical called a [neurotransmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) that binds to [receptors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_receptor) located in the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell."" So what I've understood from this is that the electrical actvity in a chemical synapse leads to the dopamine release after drug use...so then how are excitatory and inhibitory synapses involved?

1121,i1yc6f,Are invasive species really that bad in the long-term?,"Hi, just a question. Everyone is under the assumption that invasive species are inherently bad. And I have no doubt that in some cases, they are and can cause a lot of damage. But I feel like a lot of people don't have an accurate view of what they are. 

Invasive species are, technically, a part of nature. Animals and plants have constantly been migrating and surviving in different parts of the world when new opportunities for travel are available. And it ends up fine, in the future. The ecosystems being invaded definitely take damage but eventually adapt to the new species. 

So, with all this in mind, are invasive species really that bad? When enough time passes, succession will take place and the ecosystem will bounce back and stabilize, with the ""invasive"" species becoming native. All of the invasive species we've caused all across the world will either die off or adapt and become one with the environment around it. 

All of the invasive species we've caused will eventually evolve into new subspecies, and this will take place all across the world. 

One of my favorite examples is marsupials. Native to South America, they crossed a land bridge to get to Australia and S.E Asia. In the past, we would have considered them invasive. But as they spread out, they adapted to their new surroundings and filled in certain niches. Now, they're considered native species. 

Am I wrong in assuming that humans have caused a similar process to take place? And am I wrong for not caring about (Most) invasive species, as nature will sort itself out eventually? Not all of them are destructive. And perhaps some of these ""invasive species"" will go extinct in their native regions, only to flourish in the new ones we've provided them with. Who are we to say that that's wrong?",16,2020-08-01 14:46:31,biology

I like to learn things so please feel free to post your opinions if they're respectful of *everyone* I should preface that I respect everybodies right to identify how they wish and strongly believe that transmen are men and transwomen are women. Even if you do not believe this (despite the clear evidence) it doesn't really hurt you to respect a person's wishes and gender them appropriately.

I've been learning alot recently about the trans experience because it's genuinely something that fascinates me. Not just the psychological experience of trans people, or the fight for basic equally that is clearly lacking, but the real nuts and bolts science. The legitimate feeling that one is born in the wrong body, purely based on psychosocial reasons or as a result of hormone imbalances that effect someone's Psyche. 

I can't disagree that there's legitimate cause for people to believe they were born as the wrong sex, but the argument presented by advocates etc is that gender is a social construct. But if that's the case, how can transgender people exist legitimately? If it is just a construct, it's not ""nature"" that's got it wrong. It just means that you are of the sex you are born into, but wish to present differently because you feel more socially aligned with the other sex? If this is the case, it's a choice that's reinforced by negative feedback loops in the brain or a learned behaviour to be transgender and I've got to say, this doesn't fit the narrative for me.

I guess what I'm really asking, is can the gender is a construct argument really coexist with the idea that someone is ""born in the wrong body""? We certainly see examples of animals adopting the role of the opposite sex in nature when there is a need (think lioness becoming the head of a pride and growing a mane)

# News stories

In academic news, researchers at UCLA and UCSB [received a $23.7 million grant](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/nsf-grant-biologically-based-polymers) from the NSF to study biologically based polymers. Meanwhile, the founder and CEO of [Faber Futures](https://faberfutures.com/), a biodesign lab, talked about fashion, synthetic biology, and how clothes can be created using bacteria, in [an interview](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/natsai-audrey-chieza-clothes-out-of-bacteria-interview/) with [HIGHSNOBIETY](https://www.highsnobiety.com/).

The [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/) [wrote about Atum](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/This-Bay-Area-company-thought-it-might-not-15434078.php), a Bay Area biotechnology [company](https://www.atum.bio/) that pivoted, during the coronavirus pandemic, to help address a need for the manufacturing of synthetic genes and proteins. Another company that makes DNA (albeit using an advanced method), in France, expanded their [Series B funding to $89M](https://www.dnascript.com/press-releases/dna-script-expands-series-b-to-89m/). [DNA Script](https://www.dnascript.com/) uses enzymes to synthesize DNA, and will soon release a bench-top machine, called [a DNA printer](https://www.dnascript.com/), that can literally print DNA on-site, in under a day. 

[*Chemistry World*](https://www.chemistryworld.com/) ran a [piece](https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-function-of-folding/4012081.article) about the scientific quest to develop ‘foldamers’, self-folding molecules that could one day be used to develop more targeted therapies and study how RNA and proteins fold in living cells.

Finally, a [*Scientific American*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/) article [discussed research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/plants-have-hormones-too-and-tweaking-them-could-improve-food-supply/) on the thousands of hormones found in plants, and how engineers could tweak them to improve crop yield. In [*OneZero*](https://onezero.medium.com/), here on Medium, a [new article](https://onezero.medium.com/scientists-gene-edited-a-cow-to-have-mostly-male-offspring-fe8ddb92bc6) discussed the cows that have been genetically engineered to produce mostly male offspring.

# Peer-reviewed articles

A slew of peer-reviewed research results were published this week, including a high-resolution of a base editor protein (used for targeted genetic engineering applications) and a machine learning model that can shut down CRISPR in its tracks.

[**Self-Healing Material Made from Squid Teeth Protein**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0736-2)  
A joint effort from the [Sitti](https://www.is.mpg.de/~sitti) and [Demirel](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mcd18/) labs, of the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) and [Penn State University](https://news.psu.edu/story/626375/2020/07/27/research/soft-robot-actuators-heal-themselves), respectively, have developed a biosynthetic, self-healing material using proteins found in squid teeth. Published in the prestigious journal, [*Nature Materials*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0736-2)*¹*, the material can heal itself in about one second, far faster than previous self-healing materials used in soft robotics. The study was picked up by several news outlets and organizations, including the [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/article/237581/army_project_turns_to_nature_for_help_with_self_healing_material) and [*The Times*](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/squid-teeth-to-help-make-self-repair-suits-c6qnxnbpq).

[**Structure of DNA Base Pair Editor, ABE8e, is Resolved**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6503/566)  
At UC-Berkeley, the [Doudna](https://doudnalab.org/) laboratory published a 3.2-angstrom resolution structure of the ABE8e base editor bound to DNA in the journal [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6503/566)*²*. ABE8e can convert A•T base pairs in the genomes of living cells to G•C, at a rate much faster than previous base editors. This base editing protein was originally created by the [Liu lab](https://liugroup.us/) at Cambridge’s [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). To read more about the high-resolution ABE8e structure, check out the [UC-Berkeley press release](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/30/new-understanding-of-crispr-cas9-tool-could-improve-gene-editing/).

[**Anti-CRISPR Proteins Designed Using Machine Learning**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17652-0)  
The [Koonin lab](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/eugene-koonin) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in Bethesda, Maryland, used machine learning to design anti-CRISPR proteins, molecules that can inactivate CRISPR-associated proteins, which may have applications in turning off unwanted, genetic edits in living cells. The study was published in [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17652-0)*³*.

[**A New Tool for Tracing Cellular Lineages**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0614-0)  
An exciting area of research in synthetic biology in the last few years has been lineage tracing, in which researchers “trace” the genetic ancestry of each cell in an organism. In principle, one could watch a handful of cells develop into a fully-fledged animal, and determine where each of the cells in the fingers, toes, and tongue came from. Now, researchers at the [Research Institute of Molecular Pathology](https://www.imp.ac.at/), in Vienna, have developed an improved lineage tracing tool, called CaTCH, which uses a modified form of CRISPR to both identify, and isolate, extremely rare cell clones from the millions of cells in a population. The work was published in [*Nature Biotechnology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0614-0)*⁴*.

[**Tracking Gene Levels in Living Cells**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30868-0?rss=yes)  
A [group at the University of Pennsylvania](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/) developed a method called MemorySeq which uses RNA sequencing to identify “slowly fluctuating gene expression states in rare single cells”. Published in the journal [*Cell*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30868-0?rss=yes)*⁵*, the method could possibly be used to quantify “non-genetic heritability” of cellular states.

[**Controlling Neoantigens in Mice; Applications for Studying Cancer**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0613-1)  
Researchers at [Yale](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/nikhil_joshi/) and [MIT](https://jacks-lab.mit.edu/lab/news) have figured out a way to induce the expression of neoantigens — antigens that have not been previously recognized by a person’s immune system, often from a mutation in a tumor — in living mice. The method, called NINJA, was published in [*Nature Biotechnology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0613-1)*⁶* and could help scientists study how T-cells, a type of immune cell, behave during organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

1. a lot of ""prey"" animals could easily overpower their predators with vastly superior numbers if they fought as a group, but don't due to a fear. While not technically at the top of the food chain, humans dominate because they murder whatever gets in their way rather than fleeing.
2. If a lion brings down a gazelle's offspring, it's not going to have its throat slit in the middle of the night. On the other hand, if a lion eats a human child their parents will make it their personal mission to kill as many lions as possible. 
3. Revenge as a survival strategy is a long-term gain for short-term loss: taking on a larger risk to permanently deal with a problem rather than just escape it again. A family of 10 gazelles stays alive by running away and losing the slowest member to the lion. The family of 10 humans stays alive by fighting the lion and losing 2 members in the fight, but they've permanently eliminated the threat.

1209,i0twmb,Am I qualified enough for PhD programs?,"Hi, I’m currently attending school and will be getting my bachelors degree in biology this December. I’m doing the research and finding out what I need to do to apply. I really want to go somewhere where I will be fully funded and can focus on my schoolwork, because working a job while getting my undergrad has had an impact on my grades. I really just want someone who is knowledgeable in the area to review my qualifications and tell me what they think.

My GPA right now is at a 3.2, and I am expecting it to go up slightly because I’m working much less in the fall and will focus on school more. I’ve got about three cases of course based research:
1) in my microbiology lab I made a dilution series of the gut biome in a leech I extracted from a lake and ultimately isolated the DNA and identified the bacteria. I don’t have a paper for this one because it was a five week summer course and the professor didn’t require it.
2) in my ecology lab, we (as a class) observed the plant and rock etc. distribution in a nearby area and did a series of soil tests to draw conclusions on what plants grew where. It was a lot of that type of stuff. I have a paper I wrote for this one but the professor had everyone use the same methods section she provided since it was done with many many people.
3) in my genetics lab we were in the process of testing water samples to see if there were diatoms affecting it from a recent forest fire. The coronavirus put this class online before we were really able to finish and I don’t have any research paper for it. 

I have not yet taken the GRE but a lot of schools I’m interested in don’t require it anyway. I am required to take it before I graduate though and will be providing it to schools who accept it. I’m a pretty terrible test taker but I’m hoping I can do okay on it.

So, mainly, I’m just looking for advice and your honest opinions. Does it look like I’ve done enough for my application to stand out? Also open for recommendations on how to put together a CV and anything else that would help my application process. Thanks so much to anyone who responds.",4,2020-07-30 15:49:45,biology

2. He enjoys unusual manners of death

3. He's demonstrated higher than average physical strength several times in the show

4. In the Dream Machine episode, Warden canonically has thicker than usual thighs, according to his realistic CG model.

Now for the con's - 

1. Warden is pretty wimpy after season 1, perhaps he'd be too nervous to do it. 

2. He might think strangling someone with his thighs is just too nerdy.

3. During the Grumpy Pants episode he strangles Cancer with his hands, perhaps he doesn't know you can strangle someone with your thighs, as well. 

4. He could just get Jailbot to do the strangling after all.

1255,i0c9bk,Looking For Your Experiences as Biologists!,"Hello there!

I have a BS in biological sciences and since graduating I've felt a little... Fickle. I never did any internships or summer work during college for financial reasons and have been trying to bulk up my skills and experience working in low-experience requirement positions since graduating. I've worked as a Marine Mammal Observer or Protected Species Observer for the past year, and this past summer field season I've been employed by the state as a fish technician counting salmon on sonar. I don't feel like marine mammals or fisheries are quite the niche that I want to work in though. 

My plan has been to work as a tech and explore my other interests - mainly terrestrial biology, ornithology, or marine invertebrate biology. I am extremely passionate and interested in ecological studies and things like predator-prey dynamics, population ecology, etc. I've had a professor and one older coworker tell me that it can be hard to break into other branches of biology after undergrad though and that a resume that shows such broad strokes can be detrimental to getting hired. Ultimately, I want to pick one branch and then go study that in a Master's program, preferably in British Columbia in the next few years. 

My question to you all is What kind of path did your career take?

I didn’t find it hard to eat huge amounts of food, felt hungry from starving myself, lost my period probably due to undereating. It is also worth mentioning that how much I weigh now is around my body’s natural set point but according to the BMI calculator I’m still underweight, this is why (in my opinion) 4-6 pounds made such a big difference. 

I’ve noticed that most of the fat went to my stomach (protecting the organs is important I suppose) and thighs, my upper body is almost just as skinny as it was even though I am now back at my healthy weight. 

My diet wasn’t strictly healthy, rather carbohydrate rich. Doesn’t worth blaming myself for craving carbs though. (According to one of the articles I found even if you’re getting adequate calories, undereating carbohydrates can trigger Hypothalamic Amenorrhea for some women.)

Sorry for the over-zealous detailing, frankly despite the trouble I caused myself obsessing over calories and weight, I find it quite intriguing. 


My question is what would have happened if I didn’t go “all in”? (And gained weight by slowly increasing my intake?) Which one is the better approach, fast or slow?

1288,i00htq,Best Field for a Math-Oriented Person to Contribute,"Hello. I have recently completed an MS in applied mathematics, which was immediately preceded by a BS in mathematics and physics. The MS was originally going to be a PhD in mathematical biology. I left at the MS level for several reasons, but only one of them is relevant to this question. The mathematical biologists that I wanted to work with were doing a lot of research that looked more-or-less like this: they would set up a PDE (partial differential equation), either solve or prove something about that PDE, and then basically call it a day. In many cases, there was never any comparison to data, or really any reason to believe that the PDE would actuallly be useful to doing biology -- typically it was just constructed to match one or two qualitative features of the data. In the cases that I am thinking of, their work could not have been used to predict any results in an experiment (at least, to my knowledge), which is basically the goal of science. So, in my view, they weren't really doing biology.

&amp;#x200B;

My point here is not to bash mathematical biology, or to suggest that all mathematical biology is as I have just described -- I know that is not true. Basically, I'm trying to set up the question: how can someone with my proclivity towards mathematics / quantitative work best contribute to biology (and especially personalized medicine, which is my main interest). I did some work in computational biophysics during undergrad, and that was dramatically more applied / relevant that most of what I saw in grad school. So, I know there's a spectrum here, and I have looked at fields such as bioinformatics, biostatistics, physical biology, and bioengineering in addition to mathematical biology and biophysics. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here, finally, is the question: In the opinion of you biologists out there, where can a math-oriented person best contribute? Is there a lot of substantive interaction between biostatisticians and biologists? That could be a good area for me. How about biophysics? I actually have some experience there, but never made it to a conference (so I don't know much about the biophysics/biology overlap). I have heard a lot about bioinformatics lately, so should I develop my software skills? Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way, and some math bio groups really do biology, use actual data, etcetera. I'd be interested in just about any insights you have.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. All other things being equal, I would like to work in personalized medicine.

When an action potential occurs, the membrane must be depolarized where an influx of Na+ goes into the cell (making the cell more positive/less negative). However, at threshold these Na+ channels are closed and Voltage gated K+ channels are open which repolarizes the cell. Is this potassium leaving the cell? 

I thought that the rule was 3 Na+ leave the cell, for 2 K+ going into the cell, and 1 ATP is used.

1338,hze7ka,Idionella/home plastic composting,"I had the idea of getting some of the organisms currently thought to consume plastic and having a kind of home plastic compost bin. I have a few questions about it though which I've not been able to find answers for.

Firstly, it seems some organisms might not break down (I think the term is mineralise) the plastic but rather just sort of shred it into smaller plastics/microplastics. I think for my project I'd probably want to avoid these.

There's also many different kinds of plastics and some break down more readily than others. I'm not a chemist or biologist so I'd probably need some advising here (I am interested in science so any insight into what this process looks like on a chemical/biological level is always cool).

The organisms I've come across are Idionella Sakaiensis, which is sold here (not sure which country that's from or how legit it is):

https://catalog.bcrc.firdi.org.tw/BcrcContent?bid=81045

And Aspergillus Tubigensis which I've found on one website you can buy online but appears to be about £300. 

Has anyone any experience with growing these organisms/doing this kind of thing? What environments do they like best/how easy are they to cultivate?

Are there any other organisms that would do a better job than these two and/or which are more readily available?

Initially I thought I might have a community of various organisms as some might break down the plastic into a form that others can work with, but I don't know if they'd live well together. I heard once that some fungi and bacteria are really competitive and kind of chemically attack each other and this is why we can get some antibacterial drugs from fungi, because fungi use antibacterials already against their bacterial foes. Nature is great. Greature. 

Never done anything like this before so any input would be appreciated. Maybe it'd be like releasing the grey goo growing these things in our plastic world.

Initially we have a population with say, 1 PP and 11 pp and we let the people pair up and have four children per pair. The next generation has 4 Pp and 20 pp. The proportion of those with the trait has increased.

From here, if Pp only breed with pp, the ratio stays constant but if a Pp breeds with a Pp, the ratio increases and a PP is produced which then reproduces and increases the ratio again.

Seemingly, the proportion of those with the trait can only increase (assuming no loss of reproductive capacity) so why does it not take over the population? What am I missing here?",10,2020-07-28 06:29:28,biology

So first of all , I'm sorry if this post offends certain rules, or that there is a particular subreddit for these kind of questions. Also English isn't my native language, so sorry in advance encase my grammar/spelling is horrible.

First of all:  I really am torn between doing a masters, and then a PhD, or quickly applying for a PhD. So I wanted to ask you guys, based on your experience, whether you felt  that a masters was really worth doing to help you get a head start on your PhD , or you felt that entering quickly into a PhD wasn't really that challenging, and basically any tools you were not aware of, they taught you how to use them.

Second: How do you guys get paid for research? Like My professors in University do a bunch of research, but my question is, how do they get funded? Does the university pay them? Is there like a website where some companies are asking for researchers and you apply to it? Genuinely curious

Third: Do you know of any universities that can provide a full time payment for my education? I was trying to see the UK, but they really aren't pro-foreign friendly with prices.... So by the chance do you know of other countries, whether Canada, or the US.

This may be an odd ask, but here's my situation: I'm someone who realized about a month before my graduation in 2016 (Bachelor's in Biological Science) that I didn't actually want a career in the field of biology. I'd much prefer a creative career path, and am doing what I can to pursue this in my free time. In the meantime, however, I plan to continue to support myself with a full time job in the biotech/pharma field. I currently have a full time job now as an Associate Scientist at a CRO/CDMO, and it has utterly crushed my desire to continue to work in the lab (something I used to enjoy) and taken a real toll on my mental health. I am underpaid, work long hours, have tight deadlines, and my company seemingly doesn't ever promote. My work/life balance is nearly non-existent.

So, (**tldr;**) I'm wondering if anyone knows of some positions within the biology/biotech/pharma career field that operate outside of the lab, tend to have a good work/life balance, and possibly allow for some work from home opportunities?

Most of them said you should major in something that is related to marine life, such as oceanography, but my problem is that I don't know which one to go for. The biggest issue with having a marine biology degree is that most people struggle hard in finding a job once you graduate, and the best chance of you getting one is if you either pursue a master's or PhD.

I know most responses will be like ""You're still early, you'll learn more about what you want to do as you go forward in college,"" but I want to know what people think. I'm very interested in a field where I can directly be involved with oceanic life, like going on expeditions.

However implantation almost exclusively occurs with the polar side in humans so it doesn't seem arbitrary at all.

Could neck length be in response to nutrition or lack of nutrition? My family initially had good income up until I was about 9 years old. Then my dad lost his job and his industry changed. I was fed, but regular meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner weren’t consistent. My dad still works, but he has made less money ever since.

A. an Environment where one species of insects is fed and taken care of over time, but air inside is a bit more saturated with oxygen, or at least find a mixture of air similar to an Earlier Permian period's Atmosphere which IDK if thats even possible. And then Record the results, finding if they get larger over generations. (this will have to be a quickly reproducing species that can still be at least monitored if not have a few generations to measure)  


B. An Environment with a totally self-sustaining ecosystem that can be monitored, again same variables with the Atmosphere. It would have predator and prey insects along with scavengers and other fauna. Obviously flora will be present in both i just didnt list it.  


List of Constant Variables:  
Insect species being observed (as well as food/prey insects)  
Atmospheric Composition

flora

I watched this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cO1a1Ek-HD0) by Dawkins, where he claimed that the reccurent laryngeal nerve is an evidence of evolution. He claims that this nerve connects the brain to larynx, and instead of going few inches on a direct route, because evolution is blind and stupid, the nerve makes a giant detour around the heart, and therefor it is redicilously longer than it needs to be.

But I decided to [look into that](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy/Anatomical-Parts/Right-recurrent-laryngeal-nerve), and I discovered that the RLN doesn't only connects to the larynx, but also to 4 additional organs on its route (cardiac plexus, esophagus, tranchea and constrictor pharyngis inferior). Also the RLN doesn't start at the brain, but near the heart.

So my question is, isn't it a delibarate deception and a lie by Dawkins, to intentionally leave out the other organs, in order to make it look that RLN is exaggeratedly longer than it needs to be? Will a honest respectable scientist present this subject in such way?",94,2020-07-26 00:43:15,biology

Don't get me wrong she's a great teacher, but we do all make mistakes don't we.

Google yielded no direct answer and in my research I remembered that veins and arteries have a structure similar to the oesophagus with 2 types of muscle, and im assuming an epithelium layer. However capillaries are one cell thick, so how could they be organs? And ive never learnt the structure of lymph vessels so im clueless about those.

Does that make my question too vague? Is blood vessel too general of a term, and only arteries and veins are organs whereas capillaries are not?

TLDR: Why is the Hepatitis B vaccine administered so soon to babies while the vaccines for other also serious diseases are not? What is beneficial about a Hepatitis B vaccine for a baby with a still-undeveloped immune system?

This is directly related to a video in which the speaker claims that babies are vaccinated on their first day of life. I know that babies’ immune systems reach maturity at around 6-9 months, so that seemed really strange to me.

On the CDC website, I found that generally vaccines are given after 6 months - sometimes after 2 months, but those seem to require booster shots later. The only exception was the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is recommended to be given soon after birth. 

I found a bunch of great articles about infant immune systems ([including this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021731/)), but none of them stated exactly why receiving the Hep B vaccine would be directly advantageous for infants.

So, my question is: Why? What makes it effective for this vaccine to be given so soon after birth, rather than at 6 months or later? Why don’t other vaccines share this property? Why aren’t the vaccines for other diseases also prioritized in this way?",6,2020-07-23 22:59:57,biology

1612,hw4ums,"Is it possible to eat a diet of extremely fatty foods and still lose weight? Or is there something inherent about fatty foods that leads to health problems, regardless of total calories consumed?","When  a person attempts to lose weight, they must consume fewer calories than  they burn.  Usually this is done by greatly reducing the fat content of  one's diet to create a calorie deficit.

It  may seem counter-intuitive that a person could eat fatty, high calorie  junk food like pizza, chicken wings, etc. and still lose weight - these  foods are thought of as being synonymous with weight gain.  But in  theory, if a person ate one high fat meal every day, could they still  lose weight as long as they maintained a calorie deficit? (For example,  if a person ate a basket of chicken wings to satisfy their caloric  needs, and ate exclusively vegetables, fruits, and other low calorie  foods the rest of the day to satisfy their nutritional needs).  And if  so, would such a diet have other potential negative consequences?

There are two potential pitfalls to this strategy I can think of:

* First,  eating fatty foods on a regular basis could throw off your microbiome.   As I understand it, gut flora that feed on fats will increase in  population size with the increased supply of fats, and will send signals  to the brain that cause cravings for fatty foods, thus increasing fat  consumption and potentially throwing off your calorie deficit.
* Second,  what about clogged arteries?  If a person is eating fatty foods that  are high in cholesterol, is it possible to simultaneously be in a  calorie deficit and have excess plaque build up in blood vessels?  Or  would the amount of fat necessary to cause artery problems be impossible  to eat without also leading to weight gain?",6,2020-07-22 18:36:04,biology

1631,hvx41x,HELP: LMU MUNICH OR UNIVERSITY OF HEIDELBERG,"Hi everyone,

I am at a crossroads and have to take a decision quickly as I am running out of time.

I have been offered admission to Master's in Molecular and Cellular Bilogy at the LMU Munich and also to the Master's in Molecular Biosciences at the University of Heidelberg wherein I will be Majoring in Cancer Biology. The program at Heidelberg is in collaboration with the DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Institute which is one of the best cancer research institutes in the world. 

I am confused between the two programs as while I am really interested in cancer research I am having second thoughts as to if it would be a wise decision to take a deep dive in cancer research early on. I feel that pursuing a highly specialized field would restrict my career options later and it would be hard to switch to other scientific areas. In comparison, Molecular and Cellular Biology is really diverse, will give me a lot of options to pursue research in related fields such as Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Developmental Biology, Genetics etc. and I can always shift to cancer biology. I feel as a recent graduate I don't have a lot of hands on experience and it would be best to explore different research areas before I commit to a specific field, especially something as challenging as cancer biology.

Also I belong to India and I am concerned that there are not a lot of career prospects in cancer research here should I decide to return to my country in the future. 

Any advice as to what parameters I should factor in while making an informed decision?

I would notice the noise more and more and made me depressed cause I kept thinking I would have to live with it for the rest of my life!

Then I decided to visit an ENT Dr. He said I had minor damage in my middle ear (eustachian tube). I then went to a dentist because I read somewhere that having some type of mouth un-alignment could be a cause of the tinnitus. Everything looked good after getting x-rays done.

I'll go through a period of hearing it but then it will go away (as long as I'm staying consistent with my daily plan). After doing a lot of research here are some things that works for me:

\- warm cup of water or milk with half a spoon of turmeric powder. It plays a vital role as an anti-inflammatory! I have a strong feeling drinking this might have helped me significantly!!! I recall when I first started drinking this before bed, I would wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but didn't notice the tinnitus at all. I make sure to drink 2 cups per day (once during the day and once at night)

\- eating pineapples daily

\- eating blueberries daily

\- eating greens daily with meal. Every time I have lunch and dinner I'll make sure to eat spinach leaves and/or brocolli

\- nasal spray 2-3 times a day. I noticed a difference within almost 2 weeks

\- try really hard to stay busy and everything you do/everywhere you go make sure your surrounded with noise (I know that's everywhere) lol. By doing that, you are slowly programming your brain to forget that you have tinnitus.

\- meditating helps me stay in control, focused, and centered

1694,hv1qf6,A high school project thingy.,"Nobody probably cares in the slightest shape or form but for my final biology project we had to right a CER (claim, evidence, reason) as to why Trump's claim of COVID-19 being made in a lab was false. I was really proud of my response and just wanted to share it with someone other than my teacher so here it is. Give feedback if you like!

Claim: Covid-19 was not made in a lab.

Evidence: Two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its backbone are distinct to COVID-19. The backbone doesn’t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science. The tip of the COVID-19 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. The high-affinity binding of the COVID-19 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. Scientists discovered the genetic similarities of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses run deep: The virus shares 80% of its genes with the previous SARS virus and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses. They also demonstrated the virus can get into and hijack cells the same way SARS did, using human or human-like ACE2. RaTG13 bat virus remains the closest to COVID-19 across the genome, but some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to COVID-19 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues. A [paper published in the journal Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9) on March 17 assessed the genome of the virus in great detail, coming to similar conclusions to the preprint, categorically stating that it arose due to natural evolution. ""Our analyses clearly show that COVID-19 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" wrote the collaboration of researchers from institutions across the US, UK and Australia.

Reason: A mutation is an alteration in the nucleotide sequence in bases of DNA or RNA in a genome. COVID-19’s genetic material is made of RNA. RNA is a single-stranded nucleotide sequence. For some viruses like COVID-19, RNA is its genetic code. These types of viruses are more susceptible to mutations since during replication, being single-stranded, when the nucleotide sequence replicates incorrectly, there isn’t a corresponding strand of nucleotide sequences being binded to the RNA therefore, the error will most likely go unseen. In order to create a virus in a lab, the scientists would need to use a virus that already exists and alter the nucleotide sequence in the genes which would create different proteins that have different functions. There would be similarities between the virus that was used to create COVID-19. But since the COVID-19 spikes and backbone are completely different from anything scientists have seen, this points to mutations and natural selection. Natural selection, which is a factor of evolution states that organisms that have traits and characteristics that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, this is known as “survival of the fittest”. The virus that COVID-19 is derived from had a random mutation while replicating that allowed it to have these spikes and backbone that was more fit to survive and replicate in the environment it was in, which would’ve been in a human cell or animal cell that had human-like ACE2 receptors. Since the virus was in an environment where it was better adapted to survive, it rapidly reproduced which caused the spike protein that could bind to human or human-like ACE2 receptors to become more common in the virus thus creating COVID-19.  Since COVID-19 has features completely different from any other virus and random mutations cannot be done in a lab, COVID-19 couldn’t have been made in a laboratory and must be the result of natural selection. Speciation is another factor of evolution. Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species, or in this case a different strand. Since COVID-19 shares 80% of its genes with SARS and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses, they are related and COVID-19 must have evolved from one of them and became so different that it became its own strand with its own new features through repeated random mutations and separation of the viruses. One tool scientists use to look for evidence of evolution is similar genome sequences. The more similar the genome sequence between two organisms are, the more closely they are related. The sequence of nucleotides in a genome determines what proteins are made. Since there are some pangolin coronaviruses that have strong similarity to COVID-19 in the RBD, including all six of they key RBD residues, this shows that it is possible for this genome sequence to occur naturally through evolution in nature without the need of scientists in a lab to create them. Assessing the virus's genome is a good way to determine if the virus was made naturally through evolution or in a lab. By looking at the genome they are able to see if any genes were inserted from another virus or removed from the genome in order to create the proteins that gave COVID-19 the features that it has. They can also compare the genome to the genomes of other coronaviruses to look at similarity and differences between them. Also, the review of the genomes of COVID-19 was done by various researchers from various institutions which increases the validity of their conclusions. With all of the evidence of the structure and function of COVID-19 pointing towards evolution of the virus, COVID-19 could not have been made in a lab.",45,2020-07-21 00:35:44,biology

Since it is coming after a lesson about genetic sex, and as a genderqueer individual who wants to do my part to support queer individuals from a non-partisan perspective, I am using gender as my example of something that is controlled by both genetics and by environmental factors.

I am wondering if anybody can point me towards scientific resources that rule out genes as the only cause of gender?  I was able to find some good examples for how we can rule out that culture is the only cause of gender--toy studies in monkeys and humans.  I just need resources now for how we can also show that gender still has a cultural component.

What I would like to do in my lesson is have my students think about how they became ""male"" or ""female,"" and how society may have enforced gender norms onto them.  After that, they will watch 2-3 short videos.  Two of the videos are about the toy studies, which show that male monkeys and human babies have strong preferences for trucks (showing that genetics play a role in gender).  I'd also like to show them a video about ways that we still think culture influences gender.  Next, they will learn about some other traits influenced by the environment like height, language, musculature, fashion, etc.  Then they will brainstorm ways in which the environment shaped who they are today, and then apply what they learned in an activity that I'd rather not waste your time explaining.

**NOTE: If this is too long to read, just read the ITALICIZED PART.**

My mom has up and down experiences in her left ear including severe ear infections during her childhood and it was left untreated because her parents could not afford a doctor during that time. This affected her hearing. She cannot hear on her left ear anymore, her eardrum is already damaged so bad. Fast forward, Way back 2005 when she's 37 years old, she has fungi in her left ear and it happens all the time with infections and her doctor told her she needs surgery because she suspected that my mom's left ear has cholesterol granuloma. My mom refused, she is really scared of surgeries.

8 years later in 2013, something bad happen. She is just cleaning her ears when the blood runs from her left ear it was like a nose bleed. It is not painful but the blood is flowing non stop from her left ear. She was rushed into the hospital and treated. She undergone CT Scan and the doctor found out that her cholesterol granuloma is really aggressive and needed to go on a emergency surgery before it is too late. That cyst already damaged a lot of her tissues near from her brain. After all of the things happened she survived the operation. Right now, after 7 years since that operation. She told me that her left ear is itchy and I take a look over it and I found white substance it was like fungi. She panicked again and we appointed her on a doctor but it is a struggle because of this pandemic. By tomorrow she will see her doctor.

***Will that cholesterol granuloma regrow? How to avoid it? I am worrying about my mom a lot. I don't want to lose her. She almost died struggling with that disease. I inherited her ear problems and I am taking rid of it but also; my left ear is already damaged, my hearing is bad.***",5,2020-07-19 13:32:07,biology

This is a question I had for my personal research, not meant to be a riddle, but it happens to take that form I guess.

Givens:
A and B are the unknown entities here. They can be organisms, parts of a cell, cycles of an ecosystem, or any natural phenomena that fits below.

A gathers nutrients
A cannot directly use those nutrients

A and B are involved some process where B can change the nutrients into A's better functionality for gathering more nutrients


Some notes I'd like to add:
I tried to keep this as unbiased and bare bones as possible, for any variety of answers.
Feel free to ask follow up questions if anything is unclear.
All answers are welcome! This is a project I really enjoy and would do further research on regardless. 

This originates from a video game series that seems to imply natural phenomena, although it's not explicitly stated.
It can be speculated that the nutrient is CO2, due to the player only being able to take it in (what seems like) a gaseous state. Or it can be found in white solid clumps (perhaps dry ice) - where the player can turn these into a gas and absorb them as nutrients.

1837,ht965z,Title IX Violation at Uni,"Hi all,

Last year, I reported being inappropriately touched by a postdoc. I was forced to talk to my institutions Title IX office after coming forward, trying to get out of the lab I was in. It was reported to the PI on three occasions. The lab tech was also inappropriately touched. Several people saw this. Yale did not attempt to substantiate those claims. He also made inappropriate comments to a female undergrad that had been there previously. This was a pattern. First, when I told the PI about that, she laughed and said she, ""didn't get involved in personal matters"". The second time, we were standing in the lab, and I even asked the technician as well in front of her if she liked it when he came up and grabbed her from behind while she said 'no' and 'stop' repeatedly and tried to squirm away. She said she didn't like it. PI did nothing. Third try, I reframed it as a hinderance to my data. PI said she had NEVER HEARD OF THESE ALLEGATIONS BEFORE (lie) and only when her data could be affected did she do anything. When I reported this, I was made to stay out of the lab for two months-not the handsy post doc. Institution admitted that they knew I was touched, and said ""steps were taken to prevent a recurrence"". Nothing changed. We still had overlapping schedules. He's still there. When I opened the title IX report today, I was shocked to see that Yale said the claim was unsubstantiated. There were emails sent to other PIs questioning the conduct and relaying PIs response, consistently. Others who knew who the office said they wouldn't contact. This directly conflicts with what the investigators told me. I was told by two different investigators that they COULD substantiate my claims. That they had done something to prevent future incidents. Tonight, I opened their title IX report. I found mine easily.

They lied in their report. They didn't take it seriously. They have a national reputation for not taking harassment seriously, and it's spot-on.

My former PI said it sounded more like assault. I went nuclear and put it all on Twitter. No ragrets. Not even a single letter.

It's with the OCR and NIH, so I'm protected by federal whistleblowing laws.

Today, the OCR attorney called my attorney just now and he was in the room when Yale admitted I was touched by this postdoc. They openly falsified their title IX report. They played themselves. This is it-they're sunk.

I'd like this to get some more traction. If you can, I'd appreciate any retweets I could get. My handle is: DeathCab4Callie

I was in a research lab and doing some hospital internships, but due to the pandemic I obviously cannot partake in any of those. Since applications are going to come up soon and I need to decide to study for the MCAT, GRE, etc. I feel like the time is collapsing and I need to make a decision without very much experience. I am first-gen transfer student and don't have a lot of people to reach out to for advice on this. UCSD also has options to do an Honors thesis, BS/MS program for biology, and also a 1 year MA in Global Health. My graduate tuition at CA state schools is covered through a grant I receive until I'm 27. However, if I decide to get a PhD I think taking the 1-2 years for the Master's will not be useful especially since my GPA is high enough to get into graduate schools. I do not have any publications which is what I am worried about, and I heard that most PhD programs now look for published students, which is a reason to perhaps pursue a Masters before PhD.

It is most typically seen in children aged five to sixteen."" (Im sixteen) It was the second time it happend to me and nobody knew what it was. ""Hair-grooming syncope typically manifests as presyncopal symptoms during hair combing, brushing, braiding, trimming, curling or blow drying. These symptoms are followed by loss of consciousness and sometimes convulsions.Migraines, abdominal pain, ""feeling funny"" or blurred vision may also occur before or after seizures. A 2009 study identified 111 pediatric cases of hair-grooming syncope in the United States; that study found that the condition is most associated with hair cutting in males and brushing in females.

1892,hsqu44,Combining GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment analysis) and DEG (Differentially Expressed Genes) to confirm results together- is it a good idea?,"Hi, I'm trying to start a project based on R where I input cancer patient data to find DEG's to ultimately search for possible pharmaceutical targets. My focus is can I can input the same data into GSEA and DEG to confirm each other's conclusions. Right now, I'm only using DEG (voom+limma package in R) to filter/select significant genes.

I know that these two analyses are completely different- GSEA takes in a priori gene sets and gives information relevant to significant gene SETS for each phenotype. DEG will look into individual GENES (not gene sets) and gives us a list of differentially expressed genes for each phenotype.

However, I was wondering if these can work together in harmony so that we can first use GSEA to filter significant gene sets and then use DEG to test individual genes significantly enriched in those gene sets of GSEA. I thought this would help because just performing DEG inherently lacks biological significance. But while GSEA has biological significance, it doesn't have the ability to detect at the level of individual genes. So why not make them work together to complement each other's strengths/weaknesses?

For example, I would run GSEA for two different cancer types (phenotype) A and B, and find gene set X is overexpressed. Then I would look into which group of individual genes are contributing the most to the enrichment score for gene set X. Then I would run a DEG analysis of those individual genes. If I find some genes that are significantly overexpressed for specific types of cancers, that actually itself can be a probable target.

I also do recognize the difficulty of running this together- there are so many different packages that have different methods (ex. normalization methods, etc). But putting these problems aside, I'm just asking that if I could get this right, would this be a good idea?

The media mostly says ""it shows promising results...blahblah"" without digging into the science (of course, can't blame them). 

As an aspiring scientist...and potential candidate, I'm asking around the science community if they could help me understand the trial, vaccine, and have an informative discussion (rather than blindly believing the media).

Published results from the phase 1 trial: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483)

Some questions I have...please feel free to answer some or all! Any insight is appreciated

1. Does  a greater antibody response necessarily mean improved immunity? Doesn't  the trial ultimately have to involve some viral-exposure component (ie.  subjects that received vaccine are then exposed to virus, and then  measure immune response) to prove effectiveness?
2. How  does an mRNA vaccine work? My understanding is that the mRNA of the  spike protein is injected, which creates antibodies...but how?
3. What  is a pseudovirus neutralization assay? Does it use a nonactive virus to  see if it infects the subject? Is it an invivo or invitro thing?
4. In terms of an effective immune response, should we be focusing more on antibodies or T cell/CD8+ response? Or perhaps both? Most media seem to only harp on antibodies...
5.  The fact that the trial  is at phase 3, I'm assuming, means that there's a greater chance that  the vaccine is effective rather than not, and is safe rather than not.  Is this a fair assumption? Would you feel comfortable signing up for  this clinical trial?",4,2020-07-16 12:40:02,biology

Title: New Weapons to Fight Antibiotic Resistance

Where: twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch

When: Thursday 7/16, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: The ability to manage bacterial infections with the discovery and development of antibiotics was arguably one of the most important advancements in modern medicine. This advancement is now being threatened by the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. New solutions are urgently needed and despite the fact that phage therapy has frequently been touted as one of those new solutions, there are no approved phage therapeutics on the market. Here we briefly discuss how we ended up in this situation and the key technical challenges that have prevented phage therapy from living up to its potential. We outline a path to overcoming these technical challenges and bringing phage therapy to the market as a powerful solution to help us manage bacterial infections and save lives in an age of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",6,2020-07-16 12:22:18,biology

1928,hsa0iz,New research provides evidence that stress causes hair greying,"Does stress really make your hair grey? 

It is often cited as being true, but now there is evidence that it is definitely true. 

A recent Nature paper elegantly describes that RTX, a compound similar to the active ingredient in chili peppers, causes grey hair formation. 

In addition, the researchers show that the mechanisms behind this is linked to noradrenaline and its release in the fight-or-flight response. This might come as a surprise but actually it makes sense when considering that an octopus is able to change colour in stressful situations for example.

The question remains whether this mechanism is similar to hair greying induced by again, but at least there is hard evidence to proof that stress can make you look old!

so yes first things first im really interested in biology, microbiology, pathology, psychology, anesthesiology and psychiatry.

and if im gonna major in medical lab sciences id be a pre med too. someone in the program that im planning to get into said that he found it so uninteresting and useless and gives me less time to study for the mcat since ill have to spend alot of my type in the lab.

and lets say i studied biology (pre med) and didnt get into med school i think id go into ms in clinical psychology (id do the pre reqs in uni) or in cancer genetics or something related to that where my main studies are in the lab and maybe doing a phd.

and i think that a medical lab doesnt do stuff like that? (im so sorry if im being offensive but im uneducated abt this specific job)

so what do u think i should do? can i continue for an ms or phd in biomed sciences (such as genetics cancer or sth since i need a backup plan if i dont get into med school)

or should i just do biology pre med ?

i think that if i didn’t continue med school or grad school at least id secure a job in a hospital or should i not think like that? (if i majored in med lab sciences)

If I remember right, they said that they can climb almost 90-degree steep walls.

B). Graduate with a B.S. in microbiology.

1- Try to get a major in biology, and obviously try a master or doctorate in neuroscience.

2- Try to get a major in a medical course, and have the possibility to start an MD-PhD in the middle of the course. (For you understand better, in my country medical course is a 6' years underg course)

If I try MD, I could start an MD-PhD in the third or fourth year, and in 8 years finish it (an estimate, obviously). 

Education here is free, so there is not much financial costs during undergraduate. 

The problem that I am most undecided is after graduating,  because most of the biologists that I talked, became teachers or unemployed, and the possibility of getting a fellowship is extremely frustrating. 

In the case of M.D, the college I'm applying has many internships and collaborative research opportunities with Harvard, Stanford, etc. For being an elitist course: There are many more opportunities; the most influential professors and researchers at the university work in the medical department.

Also, I'm being from a third world country maybe it can give me more opportunities.

I'm practically going to the medical side more as a safe option after graduating, since I could do a residency in neurology or neurosurgery as well. (I really don't want to become a teacher or work in any other area aside from research/clinical)

I am very interested in this part of clinical research, but I also don't mind dedicating myself entirely to academic research. Neuroscience is just one of my passions, and I am interested in several others like biochemistry, cell biology, genetics (which both courses would let me follow)

Talking to a colleague who does MD-PhD, and research in neuroscience, he said that having too much contact with anatomy and neuroanatomy during his first years was essential.  On the other hand, a neuroscientist from my country said that biology is a more complete foundation, because evolution and biochemistry are studied more thoroughly.

I'm very confused about which one to try, and I would like to read some advices about it even if you want to consider the reality of the USA or your country, so I can get a sense.

These blowers use ammonia to cause their reaction and cool the warehouse/room. Now whilst ammonia levels are supposed to be tested regularly, there is a chance that it still gets through in trace amounts that are not able to be smelled or the levels aren't high enough to trigger a test and sound an alarm. There is evidence that people with schizophrenia have higher concentrations of ammonia than a normal person.

\[Source\] -  [https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full)

"" It should be pointed out that the mean ammonia level of schizophrenia patients is higher (2.02 ppm) compared to the mean ammonia level of healthy subjects (0.29 ppm) ""

They came to this conclusion after giving the patients a drug which allowed them to test for levels of ethylene and ammonia in the breath. If this is the case, schizophrenic patients have higher blood ammonia levels.

The question that I have. Would long-term exposure to trace amounts of ammonia from the artificial air of industrial refrigerator blowers potentially cause mental decline? I know the lungs and liver filter most of it out. But lets say you are exposed to this quality of air for 40-50hrs per week with no break. Is it possible that the corrosive effects of trace ammonia could cause these effects over a period of years?

Can moving from a dry state to a humid state change your body and make you sweat more?

I lived in Northern Nevada for Gardnerville/Carson City/ Lake Tahoe and Reno  26 years of my life, when I lived in Nevada I only had to shower once a day and put on a stick of deodorant and I would be fine.  I moved to Seattle WA and I notice that even showering once a day and putting on deodorant does not help. Sometimes especially in the summer months, I have to take extra long with my showers and use extra strong deodorant.   

I also noticed that in Nevada my hair was nice and straight and in Seattle my hair is curly.  I did notice when I first moved here I was sweating and had to shower with just a moderate amount of exercise.  Now I don't have to do that.  I have lived in the Pudget sound for about 9 years.  So I am thinking my body has acclimated to the moisture in the air and humidity. 

When I was living in Reno I took a trip to Philidelphia PA.  I was only there for about a week but i was sweating more and had to shower twice a day and use extra strong deodorant.   

My question is, does your body take a while to get accustomed to new environmental factors?  I have been living in Washington State for 9 years and I still feel sometimes that my body has not fully acclimated to the humidity.

I am about to be a junior in college, majoring in Cellular and Organismal Physiology. Up until this point I have been preparing for a career in veterinary medicine, but I have gotten cold feet. As I've progressed through college, I've begun to think that maybe I would happier if I could have a research-oriented career in the biological sciences still related to animals. As someone whose parents heavily pushed pre-med, I feel that I've been pressured into choosing pre-vet as a way to justify my interest in animals and biology without completely disappointing them. I've come to realize that it's not necessarily the treatment of animals that excites me the most, but running diagnostics in the lab or working on my undergrad research project.

So here I am, trying to decide where I should go with grad school in order to have a career as a scientist. I still have a passion for animals, but I just don't see myself working a day-to-day clinic job after gaining shadow/work experience. I do have some undergrad research experience, so if I decide to stop pursuing veterinary school I would definitely want to put more effort into growing that experience in lieu of more animal/vet experience hours.

Should I push ahead and try and apply for vet school while trying to earn a PhD on top of that? (I have been eyeing the dual degree programs some schools have) Or should I ditch the thought of vet school altogether and just focus on trying to get into a PhD program? How would I pivot from preparing for a career in vet medicine to one solely focused on biological research?

2010,hr7w60,How to get better PCR results!,"
Times when PCR is so critically important, thought of sharing some tips out of sheer experience! 

1) Sanitize the entire work space and required items thoroughly. 
2) Always aliquot autoclaved water in 1mL eppis and use a fresh one for every run.
3) I always kept all the tip boxes, empty PCR tubes, water, pipettes and basically everything (except genetic material) under UV for 30 minutes to eliminate any chance of genetic material contamination. 
4) Make sure your gloves are intact and not punctured. Do not handle DNA with bare hands. EVER.
5) Always wash wells before loading sample on gel. Never overload the wells. Try to leave an empty well before you load water sample to avoid mixing and show any false bands in water sample. 

It was extremely important for us to reproduce exactly same results as we were filing for a patent and had no scope for any contamination. 

Hope these help you get better results!!",4,2020-07-14 14:16:40,biology
2011,hr7uza,Biology major VS Biochemistry,"Hi! 

I asked this question in the biochem subreddit too but, not surprisingly I suppose, I got only answers telling me I should chose biochem. But I also want to hear the opinion of people who love biology. 

I just finished my masters in the humanities, and would like to do something in the sciences. Life fascinated me. Where does life begin? How does it function? What defines it? 

As such, I think biochem would be more suited to me, as biology seems to be more focused on bigger organisms (tell me if I’m wrong). 


The one thing that pushed me more towards biology, is that there’s less chemistry and slightly less maths, both of which I’m terrible at, and it is more important to learn vast amounts of information and relate these informations to each other, which I am good at. (Again, tell me if my conception is wrong)

2013,hr7g8q,I am having some difficulty using electricity to induce skeletal muscle contraction in vitro,"I am working on a project that involves acquiring isolated skeletal muscle and inducing contraction using an electrical current. I am going to then measure the force produced by said skeletal muscle.

In Luigi Galvani’s famous experiments, he took a freshly dead frog, dissected the legs keeping the sciatic nerve intact, and transferred an electric current to the leg, which moved as though it was alive. It has been replicated tons of times since then and now is a standard high school experiment.

I have been in touch with people who work at the slaughterhouse/meat lab at my university. Today, I went there and got a sample of skeletal muscle. I put it in chilled solution promptly to preserve its action potential and contractile function. 

I hooked up the muscle to the circuit. When I pressed the pedal to apply more voltage, the LED in series with the muscle got brighter (indicating that current was flowing through the muscle and that it increased when the pedal was pressed). However, the muscle did not contract at all. 

[Vid of my unsuccessful attempt :(](https://youtu.be/3NrLczzISzI)

I am starting to get a little worried. Why isn’t it working? The voltage applied ranges from 0.9V-4.5V at 16MHz. I researched the electricity requirements for maximum muscle contraction and it was under 6V at around 60Hz so the electricity shouldn’t be an issue.",1,2020-07-14 13:53:53,biology

They used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to find these neurological patterns and show that handholding is not simply a placebo. 
Handholding reduced brain activity of pain related regions, including the neurological pain signature.

Using the figure i uploaded as an example, let assume we sequence the ""outter"" circular DNA and ,in theoretically, we should find the left side of the genome (leading) has more T and G than the right side of the genome (lagging). One of the reason is that the lagging strand are more susceptible to mutation during replication due to longer exposure to the environment as ssDNA. This makes sense when we only focus on the out 1 of out 2 dsDNA produced during replication.

However, in replication, 2 copies DNA is produced. In another copy of DNA(""inner"" ciricular DNA according to my figure), the left side of the genome become lagging strand and right side become leading strand.  If we sequence this DNA sample, what will happen?",0,2020-07-12 08:56:35,biology

They have 2 children. 1 of them is gay. 

Firstly, I know that sexuality is not black and white and it's s continuum of ""feelings"" and other assciated things in the limbic system or other organs etc.

However, there are points on this spectrum where an adult can tell if they are a bi, homo, trans, whatever sexual.

Back to our story.

In the Smith's case that is 1/2 chance of having a gay or bi child if you are a gay/bi yourself. 

What do we now about this phenomenon when two, on the sexuality scale, not very heterosexual people and more bi or gay people, have children.

From purely layman perspective, it should be way rarer for tow black persons to have a blonde child. However, two blonde parents will more likely have blonde children.

Phagocytosis occurs when whole particles are taken in to be later broken down by enzymes. The process includes pseudopodia formation (protrusion of the membrane).

Pinocytosis occurs when already-dissolved/broken-down liquid particles are taken in, ready to be absorbed. This process includes invagination (forming of pouch by the membrane).

What I don’t understand are:
1. How does the cell knows that the particles they’re about to take in are whole particles or already-dissolved particles?
2. Why do cells form pseudopodia for whole particles and why do cells go through invagination for already-dissolved particles? Why can’t it happen vice-versa?
3. If the vacuole membranes from phagocytosis and pinocytosis in the same cell were formed by the same cell membrane, how do they detect which one has to be broken down and which one is already broken down?

I've found that I have no interest and passion, save for writing, in the media industry and I really would like to switch over to a life sciences field, particularly marine or wildlife biology. Research, conservation and education are my three main interests, and I'm looking at continuing my education in order to accomplish this. I could use some advice on which path to take, though!

1) I could pursue a second undergrad degree and essentially start over from scratch. Take a few remedial courses, get field and lab experience, network and move on to a graduate program afterwards (hopefully with a chance to have it paid for if I do well enough). It'd be less time than my last degree, and cheaper too. It would take longer than trying to go right into grad school, though, and from what I've been reading would do little beyond get me into the field. 

2) I could take remedial courses and get some kind of research experience so that I can compete for grad school somewhere. It'd be nice to not have to get another bachelor's, and I'd be more involved in work that would truly interest me I believe. I worry that I'd be missing out in valuable experience from the undergrad degree though, and would be at a disadvantage compared to more STEM focused graduates. I also doubt I'd get any kind of assistantship/TA position with my non-STEM background so cost would be a concern.  

Some have said that I should focus on doing science communications or wildlife media rather than go into research, but I'm not sure that's right for me. 

I realize that potential salary earnings in life sciences aren't that hot beyond getting tenure, and that's one reason I haven't fully jumped into this path yet. 

Any advice would be appreciated, can answer any questions yall might have!

Any ideas will be much appreciated! Are there any basic concepts you think can be/need to be explained using an illustration w a short blurb? They could easily be about drug mechanisms or so - but I’m unsure about where to start? Figured it wouldn’t be so bad to ask here! 

I’d really appreciate any help! 

Many thanks in advance x",0,2020-07-09 16:02:55,biology

So... why don't we create a voluntary program that allows humans to selectively breed for longevity?

First, before anyone says ""but eugenics or genetic experimentation or unethical xyz... 

1. purely voluntary. 
2. low cost so that everyone can get in.
3. controls for socioeconomic status, so that life advantages are factored out.
4. No genetic modification. Purely old fashioned natural selection.
5. Yes... this is a human breeding program... but its a voluntary one, and not done in person. -,-

So, here is the proposal. An institute would exist, with cryogenic containers that store sperm and egg samples from every single participant. Participants would be required to donate 5,000 usd to the institute. Over the course of their lives, that 5,000 would be wisely invested in safe conservative investments. (like life insurance) Every year, the participant would contact the institute. If a participant goes for 10 years without contacting the institute, the year at which they stopped contacting is considered the year of their death. 

Then, the institute would perform a matching every single year, selecting solely on age of death. Once matches were selected, the sperm and egg samples would be unfrozen, and test tube babies would be made. Surrogate mothers would be hired using the funds that the biological parents provided. Upon birth, the babies would be placed with foster care families, the institute would then use the funds remaining to ensure that the children were kept safe and sound until adulthood. Then, upon reaching adulthood, the children would be given the remainder of their parent's funds. The children would be free to pursue their own lives, but would be made aware of the institute, and would be given any memorabilia or inheritance that their biological parents provided for them.

The institute has a special upfront clause for both genders though. If you die before the age of 80 for any reason, your funds are forfeit, and your genetic material will be flushed. The institute would be blind to all variables except age of death. 

Tell me your thoughts on this from an ethical, biological, logistical and financial perspective. 

Would you volunteer to maybe have offspring you will never see?

What safeguards would keep the institute honest?

Is freezing eggs and sperm for decades viable?

Would you find these children to have an unfair advantage? If so, why are you opposed, seeing as they may benefit your grandchildren?",17,2020-07-08 20:29:53,biology

So I've always been fascinated with the life sciences and have no issues regarding academic stuff, passion, or learning wise. I can invest in school. 
There's a sort of STEM project in oceanography I'm trying to get into at my community college. 
I'm then transferring to CSU Channel Islands it's supposedly not impacted as heavily as say, Humboldt. But it might not have as many connections or prestige?

I'm seeing a lot of discouragement, especially in work subjects like research, life sciences, animal studies... I want to end up doing field work and animal work in any form whatsoever. I don't like veterinary focuses. I was an avian zookeeper for a bit and it was great but it's too heavily focused on working with the public and visitors can be spectacularily evil. I'd rather be in something a little more substantial scientifically speaking. 

With the COVID crisis that seems like it's going to kick my butt in finding liveable jobs regardless of major. But for my intentions is a General Biology BS good enough to get into these fields? Is it more rigorous/competitive than if I had pursued environmental sciences or wildlife biology? Am I a pursuing this like a complete idiot? 
I'm in my mid 20's going into the worst job market of all time so it's hard to figure out if I'm managing to get it together or not.

When you search this, all the results say the aorta, but they don’t say what “the largest” means. By weight? By length/width/volume? By capacity? Maybe it is all of these things?

Ive read that TGF-b inhibitors are effective to inhibit the formation for internal fibrosis/scar tissue, im wondering how soon could they be used after tearing a soft tissue to minimize scar tissue formation in the torn soft tissue?

 Reason I ask is because perhaps TGF-b inhibitors would inhibit healing of the tissue if used too early in the healing process? 

 im reading here “Exogenous TGF-beta stimulates the formation of granulation tissue which increases the rate of wound closure in full thickness skin wounds. The chronic expression of TGF beta can stimulate the formation of scar tissue”, am I right in saying this means that you shouldn’t use TGF-β inhibitor  until a wound has closed on the skin/surface? https://www.researchgate.net/post/what_is_the_role_of_TGF-beta_in_wound_healing

I am wondering if anyone can help me understand the differences between the energy production in Chloroplasts vs what Mitochondria do in plant cells. I feel like I have a solid understanding of mitochondrial functions (in animal cells), specially the ETC and ATP production.

I have noticed in the Chloroplasts you have photosystems 1 and 2, plus the ATP synthase structure and in Animal cells there are the 4 complexes and also ATP synthase. In animals, the Mitochondrion make the APT in Krebs cycle and in plants, the Chloroplasts make ATP in the Calvin cycle. The Animal cell 4 complex + ATP synthase and the plant cell 4 part photosystem and ATP synthase seem remarkably similar (to me).

My question is: what to the Mitochondria do in plants if they are not making ATP? 

1) Do they use the ATP made by Chloroplasts to make food?  
2) Do they make ATP in the dark reaction?  
3) Something else entirely lol?",3,2020-07-07 10:43:15,biology

I am going into my second year of school and as of now I am deeply considering the medical path. I have told this to family and a lot of friends and they are very excited for me to follow that path, but now I am starting to second guess my choices. I have a deep love for biology and have started looking more and more into going into research and attending graduate school. I know I still have 3 years left of uni, but the timelines of pathways seem to suggest I should already know what I should do and I am going to be writing my MCAT next summer. I don’t really want to undergo the process of applying to medical schools AND graduate schools at the same time because a) that’s a ton of costs and b) that’s a whole lot of work. I like the idea of medicine because it’s very hands on and engaging, there is always something new (I am interested in emergency, peds, and family). I of course would love a career where I can help others and medicine allows you to see that pretty directly. I also like the idea of research as it really seems like an adventure, and dedicating your life to learning more about the universe excites me just as much. Though I know I would hate being a college professor and feel like I don’t know enough about the job prospects in those fields yet. I know medical school graduates are pretty much guaranteed a job where as there is so much unemployment for grad students, but medical school costs are pretty insane. One thing I know for certain is that I want to continue my education after my bachelors degree regardless. I just don’t want to regret my decision or let anyone down and disappoint my parents. 

Some things to consider: 
- I don’t want to be working under someone my whole life 
- I do want to have some sort of life outside of work
- My GPA after first year wasn’t stellar (3.1) 
- I want to do something to help the world 
- My biology interests are mainly zoology, I don’t think I would love medical research 
- I want to live in the US after I graduate 
- I won’t be getting much financial help from parents at all (not opposed you joining the military if needed but would prefer not if possible)

I just want some reassurance that I am correct about my thought process here.

I run a youtube channel called Gumball Degree and I'm making a youtube video about acids and bases in regards to how it reacts in water. I know this sounds slightly more geared to chemistry but my video is currently about biology so I'll ask here. This is how I understand it.

When we introduce NaOH into water, it dissociates into Na+ and OH- ions. According to the Bronsted-Lowry Definition. A base is the molecule that ACCEPTS a proton. But how does it accept a proton when its in water? The answer is that we know that water sometimes have its own reactions between itself. A process that looks like this: 2\*H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH-. This reaction usually occursnot often but since NaOH also results in OH- ions, we see that NaOH's OH- ion is able to accept a proton and turn into H2O and this is why NaOH is a base in water. But the overall solution will have plenty of left over OH- because of this",5,2020-07-06 17:13:46,biology

2435,hmb3dt,An explanatory blog post on the Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine and how it works,"Hi guys, 

I wrote a post for the Fancy Comma LLC on how the Oxford university COVID-19 vaccine works. I found that there was no one that covered it mainly because it is quite complex. It also goes into the use of ChAdOx1 vectors, and why they were chosen for the vaccine.

The post also has images/infographics which explain the science, should you not wish to read it all :) 

If this is something that interests you, please do have a look.

all i know is that the hiv virus inserts its genes into the host cell and then it reproduces

but the genes are going to get chopped up by the proteasome  to be recycled a

and the proteins gets fed into a chamber with a separate membrane to get stuck on the class one mhc

and then the class one mhc gets to the outside of the cell to present the proteins to killer T cells

but HIV pulls the class 1 mhc molecules inside and the natural killer cells see that there is not enough class 1 mhc molecules on the surface and it kills the cell by injecting them with cytokines that signals the cell to self-destruct using  apoptosis

75% of plants are edible (300K edible out of 400K according to [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730301-400-the-nature-of-crops-why-do-we-eat-so-few-of-the-edible-plants/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730301-400-the-nature-of-crops-why-do-we-eat-so-few-of-the-edible-plants/))

29% of mushrooms are eddible (according to [http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/TopTen/Quest19.html](http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/TopTen/Quest19.html))

Now, these numbers may not be too accurate, but there seems to be a marked difference between plants and animals in terms of edibility.

Further, I was told that the most toxic poisons come from mushrooms, not plants.

# Question

Why would mushrooms be more likely (overall) to evolve toxicity (or otherwise make themselves inedible) than plants? Where did this evolutionary pressure come from?

# A Guess

I'm thinking maybe plants have other pressures, like getting energy from the sun, etc. that mushrooms don't have. And, that means the poisonous plant doesn't necessarily survive better than the one that can photosynthesize better.  What do you think?",64,2020-07-05 11:58:00,biology

Could any biology graduates give me advice on how to cope with being behind on maths in my degree? 


The last time I did maths was at GCSE. When I  started last year, we were doing lots of lab maths skills about stuff like buffers and logarithms. The lecturer staryed talking about differential equations, and laughed and said 'i hope you all know how to do these' and everyone nodded. I had to frantically google what the hell one of those was, and i still didn't understand. Before the seminar, I'd never even heard of logarithms except in passing. Ive gone through using youtube tutorials and websites but I just don't understand how to use them. I know what a log is, but i cant get any further than how the log is just a rearranged normal exponent thingy. Is it the case with logs where you just have the memorise log equations and rules? Because im sure as hell never going to understand it on my antidepressant fogged brain. The only thing I'm alright at is statistics. But anything algebraic and my brain makes the windows shutting down sound. 


Anyway, I'm clearly very behind to the point where i dont know if I'll ever catch up. My new uni course seems to have less maths, and a lot of the modules are optional.

Now, I do know that it most likely will be Mechanical/Artificial webbing, however, I do believe that there maybe a form of organic webbing. Spiders produce webs through silk glands, and are excreted through the spinnerets (which is completely different from their digestive system), so if we do have the ability to alter genes in the production of silk (we have done that with goats), then maybe it is a possibility.

2533,hl5cix,"Two dead bats, kinda worried.","So in the past 8 days I’ve had some weird bat encounters.  8 days ago (day 0) I discovered three bats in the AM in the barn.  I discovered two in my horses water bucket, thankfully it was empty.  As soon as I tipped it the bigger (assuming adult) flew away but the assumed juvenile did not.  I helped them out but they didn’t really fly (or struggled to).  I attempted to help that one climb but she got into a small space and I left her alone. While moving something in the barn I discovered ANOTHER juvenile which rushed to crawl into that same space.  There was nothing I could do so we just moved things away and called it a day. The adult flew away about 30 minutes later and seemed fine so we figured if they were related that evening they’d figure out how to get out.  That PM we didn’t see anyone and hoped for the best.  

On day 3 there was a bat crawling around but away from the barn so I didn’t think they were related but it was odd.  I lost that bat before I could get a stick and didn’t find a dead bat later so I assumed he managed to fly away.  
This past Wednesday (day 5) in the AM we found a dead bat and I took it to get tested for rabies.  Because of the American holiday I assume I won’t know an answer until later next week.   But today I found another dead bat (day 8) this time inside the barn.  
I wonder if this one is a result of the fireworks BUT, the other bat encounters make me suspicious that something is going on with our population. 

This morning we also found a LOT more droppings in the barn from last night so I am assuming a lot of bats came in to take cover from the fireworks??  If anything we definitely had an increase in bat activity last night per all the droppings. 

I suspect the ones we saw are little brown bats (if that helps to know what kind they might be) 
Rabies is of course a worry (I’ve been vaccinated and got a booster to be safe) but my other concern is some disease that could severely hurt our bat population.  

I plan to take the second one to be tested as well but I wanted to post this on here incase someone knows something about diseases in bats.  We are concerned for their safety as well as ours and our horses. 
Anyone have any ideas what could be happening?  

Also fireworks here didn’t really start until around July 1st so I do not believe that the first encounter has anything to do with fireworks.

My university just announced that Fall 2020 will be conducted remotely and students with the capacity to stay at home are being asked to do so. Obviously I am grateful that I have a stable enough home situation to stay at home, but I am concerned about its effect on my ability to do research.  
I am a rising sophomore majoring in Biology. Since I didn't have any lab experience prior to college, the labs I reached out to freshman year told me to try again sophomore year after taking science classes with a lab component. I had applied to many summer research programs but obviously they too were canceled.  
My goal is to apply to PhD programs and to pursue a career in research. I understand that admissions committees will likely look leniently on this time in light of the Coronavirus pandemic, but I am more concerned about my ability to confirm that research is the career for me prior to applying. With Spring 2020 not being confirmed in-campus, I worry that I may end up with only one year of research experience before starting my applications senior year.  
I live in the suburbs of NYC, and recently the coronavirus numbers are looking promising, around here at least. I predict that some universities' labs will open this fall, and I am considering trying to find a lab in driving distance studying something I am interested in. However, I understand that PI's will likely favor undergrads who can commit a few years to their lab and who attend their university. Does anyone have any suggestions of how I should approach this or any other ways I should explore to try to get research experience this fall?

Sorry if I come across a bit dumb, I'm revising for my a-level biology and need a bit of help.

&gt;Substrate diffuses into the active site and binds to it – the substrate must be a specific shape to fit into the enzyme  
&gt;  
&gt;The substrate forms temporary bonds with the AA’s in the enzyme to produce an **ENZYME – SUBSTRATE COMPLEX**  
&gt;  
&gt;The reaction takes place and the bonds in the substrate are broken – in this case, the larger molecule has been broken down into smaller molecules. An **ENZYME – PRODUCT COMPLEX** has formed

&gt;The products unbind from the active site and diffuses out

The problem with infections, cancer etc. is that any sort of treatment you apply selects for the ones best able to tolerate it. So how about you genetically engineer an individual such that it has genes for resistance to an antibiotic, pesticide etc. but these are closely linked to multiple (redundant) kill switch genes (I think we learned about one called Flox or something at uni - basically any gene that is selectively neutral until you activate it). You then put this individual back in with its friends and start treating with the drug you gave it resistance to. It gets a huge competitive advantage and, in a few generations, the entire population has the gene-complex containing the resistance AND the kill switches. You then activate the switches and they’re all dead (this is why you need multiple: in case, by chance, any of them lose the switch but keep the resistance).

My friend read about a stereotypical nerd who slowly strangled his room mate to death with his (the nerd's) thighs when the nerd got the victim into a ''scissor hold''. The nerd wrapped his thighs around the front and back of the victim's neck, locked his ankles and then squeezed his thighs inwards, until the victim died from asphyxiation after 10 minutes.

If a crazy nerd wanted to kill my friend this way but my friend got a tub of butter and wiped it all over his neck just before the nerd strangled him would he be able to slip out?",1,2020-07-02 00:43:40,biology

2627,hjgx2x,"Is the fatal Edward Brian McCleary case (March 24, 1962 in Pensacola, Florida) proof that dragons exist?","I heard a cryptozoology-related podcast about this case like 2 years ago, after I previously saw a documentary that mentioned this case, and they said later on in his life, he saw a therapist and eventually convinced himself there was no sea dragon, but I'm not sure if that means he made up the story or not.

On March 24, 1962, Edward Brian McCleary, 16, went out to sea with 4 friends to do skin-diving and to investigate the shipwreck USS Massachusetts. He returned alone, and told the other boy's family, rescue crews, and other authorities a terrifying tale.

I remember seeing the sketch he drew and the description and the dragon looked like typical sea dragons in fantasy artwork;

https://www.ebay.com/itm/Art-Wall-Decor-Artwork-Fantasy-Sea-Dragon-Sailboat-Oil-Painting-Prints-On-Canvas-/182824403481

The sole survivor, Edward B. McCleary, stated that the neck was 12 feet tall sticking up vertically out of the surface of the water, and it had elongated teeth. It was no crocodile or fish.

he said he saw it chase and kill 4 of his friends one by one leaving him the sole survivor. He was 16 at the time. This was in 1962. He went into vivid detail about everything from how smooth its neck was, to the shape of its pupils (an oval shape). He also went into morbid detail, such as the length of his friends agonised cries as the dragon was mauling them, one by one.

If I remember correctly, only one body was found. (The body of Bradford Jay Rice, aged 14.)

The names of the other three were Warren Felley, Eric Ruyle, and Larry Bill. They were all from Fort Walton beach, Florida.

Wondering what people's thoughts are on this. This happened approximately one mile from the beach in Pensacola (where I live) harbor, in 20-30 ft deep water. Very close to the USS Massachusetts shipwreck the 5 boys were trying to investigate, before encountering the dragon.

It's one of the most famous cases involved in cryptozoology because in this case, the witness saw people being killed by a cryptid.",7,2020-07-01 14:14:40,biology

2631,hjd2e5,Help on adding viruses to an evolutionary artificial life simulation!,"I'm working on an artificial life simulation and have been working on adding viruses to the ecosystem. 

I'm aware it's not going to be ""realistic"" in many ways, but I'm trying to get some insights to produce interesting results. You can also tell me if a particular point/feature doesn't make sense or would not produce nice results 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, once they infect a host, my viruses organically grow by producing virions (not even sure it's the right word, sorry if I'm offending anyone, I'm not a biologist, but I'll be using that to describe virus particles) which are then ""used"" in  3 manners that are distributed between through genes (can also be turned off):

&amp;#x200B;

They can use those virions to :

*  Colonize more cells inside the host, which then are scaled to fit a logistic function (x)(1-x)
*  Produce Skin Virions (kind of like sweat) that have a chance of infecting other lifeforms that will come in physical contact with the host
*  Produce Air Virions that float around and have a chance of infecting other lifeforms it touches.

&amp;#x200B;

So the thing is that I'm trying to balance those and other factors and am having a hard time figuring out  good behaviors. A few questions I'm asking myself to which I'm looking for insights in the real behavior of viruses :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a logical cap at which production to the skin/air should stop/slow ? Because as of now it can pretty much accumulate indefinitely and I'm having troubles programming impacts that make sense to me. Let's say the host get completely covered in virions to the points where it forms a complete coating over its skin, what would happen to another agent that would come in contact with it ? How should it differ from only a few particle ? 
2. When those caps are reached/approached, what should be done with the overflow ? Should it be redirected, discarded, damage the health of the host, drain its energy ? etc.   
3. Should I add genes that act as additional negative feedback loop to curb production to one direction depending on the progress toward that ? Exemple : a ""hard"" max to result in logistic accumulation ?
4. Do virus usually have a way to react/interact with their host immune system ? My agents have an immune system controlled by behavioral pathways that can use things like sensed infection level (which presents a delayed value to the ""real"" infection level depending on an agent gene) but also any other evolved pathways to senses or biological signals (exemple : having the immune system evolve to bolster when the agent see a lot of other agents around), but as of now the immune system's only effect is to reduce infection level proportionally to the infection level at the cost of non-linearly damaging the body (a background low-level immune system activation wouldn't do much damage, but a full activation could prove fatal depending on the immune system full strength gene)   
5. Acquired Immunity is incredibly complex in the real world. I don't have it implemented as of now but I feel like it's somewhat important, but I'm struggling to find a way to develop it in ways that would be compatible to a few genes or numbers  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that's a little long, but again, I'm mostly looking for insights. And any amount of it on any of those points would be incredibly helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m a musician and writer currently employed as an adjunct professor of jazz piano and theory at two universities, and have worked and taught extensively as a professional musician since I graduated with a bachelor’s of music degree in 2015. I love music and I love teaching, but I don’t love working in music academia. I have felt a pull towards natural sciences and public sector work for years, and quarantine gave me the clarity I needed to re-evaluate what I want to do. I’m fortunate to have the time and flexibility to go back to school sometime soon, and want to make sure that I am as prepared as possible. 

I got decent grades (3.7ish) in high school and my first undergrad, and took AP bio and chem in HS and oceanography in college. Other than that, I’m starting from scratch. I (think?) that I have a realistic idea of how much school I’ll actually need to go through before I get any type of job in the field, and am going into this process fully expecting that I’ll either need to pursue graduate work or professional school after this degree. 

I’m currently a volunteer docent at my local science center, and I’m planning on taking two or three introductory biochem classes at a community college next fall before applying to universities in the spring. I am also planning to take a lab skills continuing ed class. I have also volunteered at a hospital in the past (as a patient guide/front desk clerk, nothing exciting) and although I’m looking for more volunteering or shadowing opportunities at local healthcare facilities, it’s tough to find those right now because of COVID.

2683,hiu45v,Could someone help me out with a few difficult questions regarding eel biology? Or recommend some literature?,"Ok so I’ve always been a huge fan of eels specifically those in the gymnothorax classification. I’m having a horrid time finding the appropriate literature to answer my questions. At this point I’m worried that we may simply not have the answers. 

But for starters. I am under the impression that most freshwater eel/unagi have a leptocephalus larval stage. Despite this behavior being observed in fish that are not technically true eels, I have read in a few places that many “eels” have this trait. I am uncertain as to weather or not this is true of all eel including the marine varietals.  Is it accurate to assume that they absorb nutrients through their skin? 

And to date I have yet to find one credible source that shows the successful captive breeding of these/any eels. Does anyone know of it being done, and if not to we have any indicators of the primary issues in doing so? I imagine replicating the salinity shifts for the various marine born species would be a big hurdle but frankly have no idea. 

And finally, sex. I currently keep a ribbon eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita) I’ve had him for about 4/5 years now and he is beginning to exit his hermaphroditic stage and enter his/her adult female stage (assuming I am reading the behavior correctly). Do most/all eels have these stages and shifts in sex? Do we know what exactly motivates them besides age?

Sorry there’s just so much that I want to know and google scholar is only showing me information about preserving a specific species through cryogenic sperm procedures. 

If anyone has any books or maybe cool articles I would be forever in your debt. I really really love eels. They’re the closest we can get to dragons in the natural world and I think the current state of the oceans is going to have more and more negative effects on them. So I want to learn everything I can.",0,2020-06-30 14:18:10,biology

2722,higsf4,"Have Molecular Studies Been Done on Woodpeckers, Parrots, Kingfishers, etc.?","Have there been molecular (not fossil) evidence of when the following bird orders debuted?  
 

Coraciiformes (bee-eaters, rollers, kingfishers, todies and motmots)  
 Piciformes (woodpeckers, toucans, jacamars, puffbirds and barbets)  
 Psittaciformes (parrots)  
 Falconiformes (falcons)  
 Bucerotiformes (hoopoes and hornbills)  
 

I ask this because of two reasons.  One, because the first two orders  are featured in the Speculative Dinosaur Project, a speculative  evolution scenario which detailed on how life might've looked had the  dinosaur empire not fallen 66 million years ago.  This would have  suggested that both clades were in our timeline around long enough to  witness the Chicxulub extinction event, but is this true?  
 

Two, the Wikipedia article on ""Parrot"" states that the order debuted 50  million years ago in the Eocene, yet the molecular evidence suggests  that Psittaciformes is a much older order than that:  
 

&gt;Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 million years ago (Mya) (range 66–51 Mya) in Gondwana. 		  

&amp;#x200B;

But the article on ""New Zealand parrot"" says differently:  
 

&gt;The superfamily diverged from the other parrots around 82 million years ago when New Zealand broke off from Gondwana, while the ancestors of the genera *Nestor* and *Strigops* diverged from each other between 60 and 80 million years ago.

2803,hhydjb,Is covid-19 really such a bizarre occurrence?,"I was listening to the Joe Rogan Podcast (yes I know not an extremely credible source but hear me out). He was talking to Eric Weinstein, a evolutionary biologist. Basically Weinstein's argument was that covid-19 had a high probability of being lab created (or enhanced) because it had two very rare attributes. One being that it was able to cross species and the other was that it was highly transmittable. He said that the combination of these two is so rare that the chances of it being a lab creation are more probable. (Especially because a bio lab is in the neighborhood of where the virus originated in Wuhan. 

I'm no biologist although I think I know more than the average person on evolution. Very basic knowledge nonetheless. I am however a security expert, I know the concept of risk and Murphy's law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong).

I think the argument of the two rare attributes of the virus is not substantial. Statistically, this virus is a once in a 100 year occurrence. People tend to focus as well on things that have impact and neglect data on things that didn't have impact. Meaning, of course this virus has rare attributes otherwise we would have a pandemic very frequently.

Once again, I am not a biologist  or have a significant amount of knowledge on the subject. It does grab my interest and therefore my question. Is his reasoning right? Is covid-19 arguably lab-created due to the rare attributes it holds?",9,2020-06-29 06:45:46,biology

2880,hhao4o,How to decompose animal skull/bones? What happened?!,"Hey all! 
Any tips or tricks on how you decompose your animal bones? 
I know beetles are great but I only get specimens every now and then so looking for alternatives.
I recently tried the bury method after I found a fresh dead bird and a gummy sharks head on the beach.
I buried them about 4 months ago (just in my back garden) about 30cm deep, to hopefully dig up a nice bird skull and sharks jaw in a few months.

I’ve just gone to dig them up and they seem to have disintegrated?? Is this even possible? 

I’m not sure what else could have happened to them but there’s no trace of them at all.

There’s no way any animals could have got to them as I had an upside down steal fire pit on top of where I buried them. 

Only new to working with skulls and bones so

2882,hh9xf7,Limit of calories from body fat per day," I have recently heard that one cannot get more than 65 calories from each kilogram of body fat per day. For instance, if you have 15kg of body fat, the maximum amount of fat you would be able to burn per day would be proportional to 15x65calories which is 975calories. Since 1kg of body fat is approximately 7700calories that would mean you cannot lose(given that you have 15kg of body fat) more than 130g of body fat per day. Therefore, if you are fasting for a longer period of time and your body does not have enough fat stored to supply your daily caloric needs, your body will start breaking down your muscles. I would like to know if any of you have come across a study that shows a limit to how many calories one can get from 1kg of body fat.",0,2020-06-28 01:48:02,biology

Need realistic advice on outlook.,"I'm a 23 year old EMT and I recently decided that I want to go back to school to finish off my bachelors. I got an Associates degree in graphic design immediately after finishing high school but decided to pursue EMS instead. I'm considering a BS Degree due to this headstart on my General ED as opposed moving on to paramedic/fire academy as many EMT's do.

Biology interests me due to the relation to my EMT studies. I am just concerned because I feel immensely ill equipped even compared to most recent high school grads. To be quite frank I really just fucked around in high school and did the bare minimum to graduate (algebra 2 and intro to Bio). I've never taken chemistry, pre calc, calculus or even a real bio class for that matter. The extent of my high school academic accomplishments span about what most kids accomplish in their freshman/sophomore year.

With all that said, does this sound like a realistic goal to set out for myself? One of the main reasons I am looking into sciences is because everyone agrees arts are highly competitive, low paying and lacking in job outlook... but is Bio really any better when it comes to competition and job outlook at least?

2896,hh6712,Did humans invent religion as the result of a predatory avoidance heuristic?,"Calling it a “predatory avoidance heuristic” is probably not actual scientific nomenclature but allow me to explain. 

I don’t exactly recall where I heard this, but it was something to do with religion and biology. Essentially humans would assume that natural phenomena like lightning and floods, were caused by deities as a result of over-applying a preexisting predatory avoidance mechanism.  

Science tells us that lightning is not the hand of Zeus or Thor, instead a naturally occurring force of nature. That being said other naturally occurring manipulations of nature are things like the wind shaking a bush. However - science doesn’t tell us with any degree of certainty that a bush shaking has to be purely the product of wind applying force to the leaves. Instead there exists a potential probability that it could be an unseen predator stalking an unsuspecting human. 

So as a result, if you are a vulnerable, weak primordial human being, and you notice the rustling of a bush, then it is logically safer to assume that the bush is being manipulated by a life-threatening predator rather than something  innocuous like the wind. If you dismiss the sound and you’re wrong, you likely die. 

So - that particular mechanism is over applied in our psychology to things that science tells us are not the manipulations of living things like earthquakes, volcanoes, or rain. It’s maybe why we call these events acts of God. It could also explain our fear or the unknown, the fact that when we are left with gaps, we fill in the blanks with monsters, deities, or some inexplicable ‘thing’ to inexplicably dread.

It would be cool if this existed, buuuut... does it? Is there a name for it because I would love to know. I can’t seem to find it when I search it up.",7,2020-06-27 20:54:52,biology
2897,hh62d3,How do we know that saving certain endangered species is the right thing to do?,"First off, I have only a bit more knowledge on conservation biology compared to the common person (senior undergrad biochem major), so these are genuine questions, not trying “stump” people. Also, I just want to say I am 100% an advocate for species and climate conservation and in no way skeptical of human beings having direct and detrimental impacts on the biosphere in general. Anyways...

How do scientists even understand whether or not a species is undergoing a natural extinction, rather than the typically cited case that it’s from human involvement? 
One thought I had for this would be species undergoing rapid and unusually large loss of population over a relatively short amount of time would be a good sign that humans are involved. However, even then how could you determine whether or not a sudden extinction of a species is a direct result of human interaction? I can imagine quick extinction of species has happened many times before modern humans appeared on earth.

This also leads to my next thought: I imagine it can be very easy to make conclusions to any type of species extinction event as that of human involvement. How do scientists know when to rule out human involvement, when we seemingly interact with every aspect of the environment and all life on earth one way or another? Every single time I’ve read the result of an extinction or endangerment of a species being from human involvement, I never even have a second thought or skepticism of these claims, which is bad basic science as EVERYTHING should be questioned. 

Overall, how could we know saving an endangered species is actually bad for the balance of its respective ecology?

Hey guys, I hope you are all doing well. I am 16 years old suffering from Minicore Myopathy, a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy that is non-progressive. I am able to walk independently but I do suffer from dilated cardiomyopathy and lung difficulties.  I have been dealing with these feelings of frustration for a long time and wanted to share.  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy rightfully gets the attention it deserves because it is the most common and the most severe. But I would also appreciate it if Minicore Myopathy gets some love in the research and gene department. I have an Marfanoid Habitus and I'm still being tested to see which gene mutation I have. All this motivated me to go into this field to hopefully cure this disease for me and many of you guys out there. Through stem cells, gene therapy, robotics via exosuits and nanobots, we should see a drastic change in care for all of us but especially people that have Muscular Dystrophy.  However if any of you, for the time being, can raise awareness for this disease it would be much appreciated, as not enough research and funding go into it. Despite it probably being an easier fix than most muscle disease such as Becker's and Duchenne because the Dystrophin gene is the largest gene.

I have an idea to make my lizard men regulate temperature using a sail on their back and head. My idea is that when warm, they'll pump blood into and through the sail to let it cool down, and when cold they'll retract blood from the sail to retain their body heat.

Does this make sense biologically and physically? Is this idea workable?

I like it because it allows for cool body language: A lizard man flushing his sail with blood can indicate excitement or stress (like sweating or blushing in a human), while drying out the sail can indicate calmness or even fear (like shivering).

At the AP's peak, the sodium channels will be inactivated, until it goes back down to the resting potential. What's the difference between an inactivated channel and a closed channel? Is it that a closed channel has the possibility of opening back up, while an inactive channel can't open back up until it goes back to the resting voltage and becomes closed?

Burning this body fat requires that a person enter a calorie deficit (the calories they burn in a day must be  greater than the calories they gain by eating).  When a calorie deficit is achieved, how does the body go about getting rid of its stored fat tissue? 

If a person is running to burn extra calories, does the body use other fuel sources during the run itself (like glycogen), and then burn the fat later to make up for the calorie deficit?  Or is your body fat burned as you run to fuel the run itself?  As a thought experiment, if you could take a 100% precise measurement of the exact amount of body fat in your body, would you notice a decreased mass immediately after a run, or would it take time for the mass of your body fat to drop after your run?  And does sleep play a role in the process?

My question put simply: “is the CO2 these plants give out negligible to the amount of oxygen produced at night?”

My poorly educated guesswork tells me there must be some sort of drawback for a plant to be able to produce oxygen at night. The other side of my guessing tells me if a plant takes in CO2 to make oxygen, then it must be producing a net positive of oxygen.

3106,hexo8s,What is the most precise definition of Osmosis?,"I’ve seen osmosis defined in several different ways in different textbooks and sources. A google search for the term returns the answer “a process by which molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one, thus equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.” 

I’ve seen several other sources say similar things about water moving from low to high solute concentration, but I noticed a problem with this definition in a plant physiology textbook. 

The book mentioned that osmosis was driven both by a concentration gradient and a pressure gradient (due to the pressure aspect of water potential). So it would seem more correct to mention water potential in the definition: “diffusion of water from a place of high water potential to low water potential across a semipermeable membrane.”

But then other sources bring up additional definitions, saying that water moves from high to low water concentration, but this doesn’t sit right with me either.  This is because books like Campbell biology take caution to mention that water moves from high FREE water concentration to lower free water concentration, explaining that solutes bind the number of water molecules that are free to cross the membrane. They define it as “the diffusion of free water across a selectively permeable membrane,”

Then we get into the word diffusion. If I’m trying to explain osmosis to someone simply without having to explain a precise definition of diffusion, would it be correct to say that it is just the “movement of water across a semipermeable membrane?” And then just mention it happens without input of energy?

While I take more after the German side, dark brown hair, but not thick (it may be a little thicker than average I'm not sure) I'm taller than average in my country and my family (minus my German relatives, pretty similar height), and a few other things. I take a lot after our grandmother. My question is why do we look like opposite sides of our mother's ethnicity? My mom also looks more like her father (Lebanese). 

To clarify a bunch of things now. When I talk about looking more German, it's in reference to how my German relatives look and based off of their features, not any average or typical feature. Also I'm certain my brother and I look almost nothing like our fathers because my father is blond, he has brown eyes, and he's quite short, it's the same with most of my family on my dad's side. He's French as well, unsure if that matters. Also, I have hazel eyes which I'm not sure where I got, and I'm assuming the German but I really don't know. For my brother's father, I'm pretty sure he's Irish and/or English and not much else, he also I think has black hair, it could be brown (he's been mostly bald the entire time I've known him, he's mostly grey now, and with old pictures it's hard to tell), but definitely nowhere near thick and he's quite pale and I think has blue or grey eyes. I'm unsure about other family but I think it's generally the same on most of his dad's side. Also neither of us look exactly like the one side, it's just that's what we mostly look like. So for example while I do have a lot of the German features, I look so much like my mom when she was younger, but it's mostly in the face shape rather than anything and my skin has somewhat of a greener undertone, almost like olive, but I'm very pale. Also my full brother has the same basic features as me, so the dark hair and height and stuff but he has my mom's brown eyes and his facial features are more like my dad's. His hair also is a different shade of brown, mine is more red. I'm assuming since my grandma had very red-brown hair. I also have a half sister who shares the same dad as me, but we look nothing alike and she takes after both her father and her mother for sure. She does look like me when I was younger, but as she gets older the similarities disappear so there's that. 

I don't know if I missed on clearing anything up so it's not confusing, and I don't know if I used any sort of correct terminology, but oh well, I'm sure it's at least legible. I've always thought ethnicity was perfectly split, so I would be 25% Lebanese, 25% German, and 50% French, but now I'm not so sure so that's why I'm asking. Also it'd be super cool to learn about this since I'm seriously considering having a career in the field of biology.

I don't need a very detailed explanation (it would be cool, but it's not necessary), just enough to help me understand the way it works. I've seen a lot of things on the explanation but the ones I've seen have mostly been inheriting different genes from different parents. I just need to know why the visual features are so different for 2 kids sharing one parent's DNA. I may have put in too much information, but I didn't want any confusion and I didn't know what info was needed. I understand that this subject is complicated and probably difficult to explain, but I'd appreciate it.

https://youtu.be/b3J7hdXUhsY

As per the video, it takes around 45 minutes for the shell of a capsule to dissolve in stomach. Which means that the contents of the capsule are not released in the stomach in the first 45 minutes. 

We are often advised to take fat soluble supplements with something like curd or oil, or to just to take it after meals. But as shown in this video, the capsule will not interact with the curd/oil in the first 45 minutes. And once it's released, by that time perhaps the fatty substance we consumed it with would have been dissolved by the stomach and hence unable to bind with the medicine? 

So my question is, is it a good strategy to consume the fatty substance around 45 minutes after consuming the capsule, so that it can bind with it? Or that fatty substance will still be present in the stomach at that time to bind with the supplement? 

Ofcourse, we could open up the capsule and mix it with a fatty substance before consuming. But given that most supplement and vitamins aren't exactly a tasty treat, I would prefer to swallow them instead.",1,2020-06-23 13:43:12,biology

3162,heb3ed,College project group argument on partenogenesis. Please tell me I'm not the retard.," We are discussing the classification of the concepts of: partenogenesis, pseudogamy and hybridogenesis.

 I say partenogenesis is one thing and the other two are other things, that we could group together in something like ""copulation dependent asexual reproduction"".

 Project mates tell me hybridogenesis and pseudogamy are kinds of partenogenesis.

 PARTENO= virgin. But partenogenesis can involve copulation? Every definition of partenogenesis I can find supports my theory. Including the one in Origin of the Species: ""Partenogenesis is the production of living organisms from UNIMPREGNATED eggs or seeds"".

 (For reference: hybridogenesis and pseudogamy are kinds of asexual reproduction that necesitate interaction between the egg and the sperm, but in which there is no fusion of the nuclei).

 A girl in the group decides to ask the professor via email without consulting anyone. It's the day before our presentation on PARTENOGENESIS and you tell the professor we don't know what it is. Smart move. Tactics 100 indeed. 
 Idiot professor says it's kind of a technical point, but in a very non commital way agrees with the idiot classification.

 Everyone disagrees with me or doesn't care. It's settled, tomorrow we are presenting the project with this retarded classification.

3189,hdoudm,Afraid of making the wrong career choice,"Hi all,

as the title states, I'm a bit conflicted about my career options. As of right now, I'm working on my BSc thesis and I expect to graduate this summer, with a BSc in biology. I was planning on continuing with a MSc in the field of ethology/animal behaviour, maybe with some extra courses in neuroethology, however, I'm now doubting that decision.

I've always had broad interests, so picking a BSc major was already difficult. I was very interested in medicine (I thought about becoming a surgeon), (wildlife) veterinary medicine and wildlife biology. I ended up choosing for the latter, because the idea of doing fieldwork and discovering new things was absolutely thrilling.

But after having looked at career options for ethologists/wildlife biologists, and considering my BSc research project, I'm afraid I made the wrong call. Maybe my research project gave me the wrong idea (due to the pandemic messing everything up and having to work from home), but it seems like there's a big chance of ending up in an office. I choose this major with the goal of being able to do research ""out in the field"", getting down and dirty. I don't want to end up inside looking at a screen 99% of the time. I know analysis and writing is a big part of research, and I don't mind that at all! 

Besides, the ""what-if' questions keep nagging me. What if I had chosen to study veterinary medicine instead? I like doing research, but I don't want to become a professor (I don't want to teach). Being a wildlife veterinarian sounds like a dream job, but I would miss the research. If only I could combine the two...

Basically, what are the options if you want to do research in the field, but don't want to teach? And is there any way to combine wildlife research with veterinary medicine? How did you all make your career choice?

I posted this in r/chemistry and r/DIYBeauty, but I think this is where it belongs

So basically, I am trying to formulate a skincare treatment to restore beneficial bacteria to my skin microbiome, in particular, I want to encourage s. epidermidis to ferment glycerol into acids that can kill off P. acnes. Yes, I have pretty persistent acne. I'm interested in this self-sustaining/homeostatic concept of bacteria on our skin THAT IS IN BALANCE with other bacteria, and can KEEP the balance. 

So I included loads of prebiotics, like inulin, oligosaccharides, sucrose, some plant sugars, and yeast proteins in the formulation. And of course, some bioferments. This is where I am worried (about the shelf-life, and \*\*preservative choice\*\*). 

My formulation is mainly comprised of bioferments of ingredients like rice, and it contains several strands of lactobacillus and other probiotics. Basically the formulation is chock-full of active fermented microbes, but I need to preserve the thing. Some preservations, like phenoxyethanol, is an irritant. 

I've decided to go with Silver citrate + citric acid, as well as an anti-microbial lactobacillus strand. I've included a third, gentler preservative — gluconolactone. My question is, will these preservatives kill the beneficial probiotic strands/microbes in my product? They are broad-spectrum after all. 

Please keep reading this next bit!

My formulation is currently this:

Deionised water, MC-Glucan (10%), Dimethyl Isosorbide (8%), Lactococcus Ferment Lysate (8%), Makgealli Extract (7%), Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract (7%), Hydrolized Yeast Protein (7%), Amber Extract (7%), Ophiopogon Japonicus root extract (7%), Inulin (6%), Leucidal Liquid (4%), \[water, milk proteins, bilfida ferment lysate\] (4%), \[alpha-glucan oligosaccharides, P.S. root juice, maltodextrin, lactobacillus\] (4%), Gluconolactone (3%), Bio Chelate \[water, saccharomyces zinc, saccharomyces copper, saccharomyces magnesium, saccharomyces Magnesium, saccharomyces Iron, saccharomyces Silicon\] (2%), Hydrolyzed hemp protein (2%), Silverion \[silver citrate, citric acid\] (0.15%)

Any glaring mistakes? Luckily this is a water-based, oil-free project, so I didn't have to add emulsifiers. Any stabilizers necessary? I estimate the final pH (after adjusting, of course) to be 5.8.

I'm worried about the amount of microorganisms in this, and the preservatives used. Will they kill all the beneficial microbes? Anyone know of a preservative/preservative system that is broad-spectrum, but is gentle and does not attack certain strains of commensialistic/beneficial bacteria?

I realize that was a kind of snoozy read, but if you have any suggestions/knowledge about cosmetic chemistry and bacteria, PLEASE reply!

3207,hddr0p,Can a phenotype change over an organism's life,"To specify the question:

Wikipedia writes: ""Phenotype is the term used in genetics for the composite observable characteristics or traits of an organism. The term covers the organism's morphology or physical form and structure, its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code and the influence of environmental factors""

The ambiguity rises from the word 'and', which could either mean 'mixed with' or 'either one, possibly both'. 

One can imagine a situation in which something like an organism's ""physical form and structure"" is changed by something that has no genetic basis (removing a limb or an added prosthetic). Is that a change to phenotype or something else entirely? If it is something else entirely, does that concept have a name?

3213,hdb56a,Looking for book recommendations re. how plants decide to allocate energy for growth / reproduction / storage etc.,"Hi All - as the title says, I want to learn more about the energy allocation decisions taken by plants, and am struggling to find \*the definitive\* book. 

How do plants decide whether to direct 100% of the energy they generate to growth, or possibly store some for harder times? How do they know whether it's in their best interest to promote root vs. stem vs. leaf growth? Is reproduction a sign that they think their life is coming to an end? Are their growth aspirations limited after a certain period, after which their energy allocation decisions naturally change? If not, then I'd imagine that in the ideal environment, a plant would just keep on growing forever..? 

So far I've come across the fields of 'Biomass Partitioning' and 'Plant Strategies', but would love a general book that tackles all of these questions, and ideally does so from the perspective from lots of different plants. 

Finally, I found this sentence from the Biomass Partitioning wiki page especially interesting: 'By responding to environmental stimuli and partitioning biomass accordingly, plants are better able to take in resources from their environmental and maximize growth'. Is maximising growth an innate, hard-coded priority for all plants? Are some plants more 'hungry' for growth, and are other more indifferent, or are they all desperate to grow as much as possible? If there is variation, what is the factor that drives the underlying level of desire for growth?

3245,hctdnm,Help Finding Specific BlaZ Gene Type Sequences on Genbank,"Hi everyone,

I am doing an undergraduate research project that involves being able to do blaZ gene typing for different strain types of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria; for reference, here are some of the papers on this topic:

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3421557/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3421557/) 

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC188454/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC188454/) 

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC106017/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC106017/) 

Right now, I need to be able to align blaZ gene sequences in plasmids (or chromosome, when looking at type B blaZ genes) of different bacterial strains to the four blaZ gene types (A, B, C, and D) reference strains as mentioned in the first paper. The first paper provides the following strains as ""reference strains"":  type A, PC1; type B, 22260; type C, RN98; and type D, FAR19. However, I can only find the nucleotide sequence for PC1 and the partial sequence for 22260 on Genbank; when I search for RN98 or FAR19, no relevant results come up. Even though these gene type sequences should only be distinguishable by several SNPs, it's important that I have references for all four for the most accurate strain typing. 

In the last paper, I noticed they provide some of the differences between all four blaZ gene type nucleotide sequences, but not in a ""from start to finish"" order (i.e. the numbering above the nucleotides is not sequential and the sequence comparison length overall is less than 846, which is the length of the PC1 coding regions). Please advise, as after countless searches on Genbank I still do not have the specific sequencing information I need for each blaZ type.",0,2020-06-20 15:40:51,biology

I then measured the number of bubbles produced in these test tubes for each solution in cm. The answers were as followed: controlled - 0.9cm, acidic - 0.5cm and basic 0.1cm. I'm unsure how these results are even possible when upon research catalyse only work between 7-11pH and I had already predicted that the best outcome would be from the basic solution as H2O2 is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, producing a near-neutral solution. Any help or idea to what I am doing wrong would be appreciated and help as to what the true pH of each of these solutions are.

3320,hc3516,Help w/ Dissipative Adaptation in Self-Driven Assembly,"**Context**

""It is instructive to consider how this physical mechanism plays out in a clear and accessible case, such as that of the mechanically agitated self-replicating amyloid fibres studied by Carnall and colleague. The authors synthesized building blocks for dithiol macrocycles ligated to peptide tails. By vigorously shaking these components over the course of days, they were able to observe the self-catalysed growth of particular fibrillar species made of stacked macrocycles. In this case, the basic mechanism proposed was that the slower linear growth of fibrils was accelerated through mechanical perturbation, which increased the number of exposed end-points by breaking fibrils. **Since longer fibrils are more ‘competent’ to absorb work and snap, but shorter ones polymerize in less time**, a balance was struck that favoured the exponential growth of fibres of finite length. This may explain why it was found that shaking enabled hexamer growth to compete with the **normally faster heptamer growth**, since **heptamers were less competent to snap under shear**. ""

**Question**

According to what is initially highlighted in bold, heptamer growth should be slower-growing, and more competent to absorb work and snap. Why has the author written the opposite in the final lines?",1,2020-06-19 10:52:58,biology

""where the probability in a short period of time *dt* that one particular replicator gives birth should be ***g dt***, while the probability of a newly born copy decaying back whence it came in the same-length interval time should be **δ** ***dt***\*\*.\*\* ""

He then writes this:

""One recent study has used *in vitro* evolution to optimize the growth rate of a self-replicating RNA molecule whose formation is accompanied by a single backbone ligation reaction and the leaving of a single pyrophosphate group. It is reasonable to assume that the reverse of this reaction, in which the highly negatively charged pyrophosphate would have to attack the phosphate backbone of the nu- cleic acid, would proceed more slowly than a simple hydrolysis by water. **The rate of such hydrolysis has been measured by carrying out a linear fit to the early-time (20 day) exponential kinetics of spontaneous degradation for the RNAase A substrate UpA, and the half-life measured is on the order of 4 years.10 Thus, with a doubling time of 1 h for the self-replicator, we can estimate for this system that ln\[g/δ\] ≥ ln\[(4 years)/(1 h)\] ""**

**My Question**

In the bolded bit, why has he taken g = 4 years, and δ = 1 hour? If the doubling time of the self-replicator is 1 hour, then shouldn't g = 1 hour?

Due to COVID and forced quarantine measures, the semester was cut early. Online classes were also suspended in consideration of those who don't have internet access. For these reasons, my university has decided to change the grading scheme from numerical-based to a ""Pass/Fail"" system. We can opt to get a ""pass remark with adjectival description"" to qualify the ""pass"" remark (basically, numerical ranges are given a distinct adjectival description; ie. 4.0 to 3.5 = excellent). We can also opt for a numerical grade but these are all upon the discretion of the professors.

My question is: **how do you think this grading scheme will affect my PhD applications in the future?** I will probably apply in PhD programs abroad 2 years from now. Yes, conditions might be better by then but the change of grading scheme will still be reflected in my transcripts. I also know that other factors are taken into consideration like publications, conferences, extra-curricular, work experience, etc. So let us brush those aside for now and surmise how a ""pass"" remark will be viewed by universities.

My experience.. 
I’m a biomedical Science student so I never dissected anything. I was required to look and feel. Along with a theory test, we had to do a physical, but there was no dissection.

Towards the end I enjoyed it more than I did at the start. It took me a while. I went in pretty depressed, and it made me think.... we either end up below the ground or like this.. what’s the point!? It made my depression much worse. However I got better, and I started enjoying it more.

For me, the toughest part was the flesh. Specifically the muscles. It was rough. My favourite part was the first time seeing the spinal cord. Just like a sting ray tail. Amazing! I also love the CV system so seeing the heart was great... the blood vessels, not so much. But for sure, the muscles were my least fav. They were also the thing I had to spend the most time on because we had to name every one- deep, superficial and medial- so we had to view them a lot... I hated it.

Also, I will never, ever , forget the smell. I know it’s all the preservative, but it’s disgusting. Everytime I have to use that squirt disinfectant soap, it puts me right back in that lab. Eh.

I am in a biomedicine degree so I’m not in medical school to be a doctor. I just have a very big interest in medical science. I’ll never have to cut through a body, so I’m lucky and didn’t have to dissect or cut any of the cadavers.. Theory is my main thing and I don’t have to do the physical as much. And even though I enjoyed the lab at the end, three full semester of it was enough for me and I don’t think I will ever steps foot in one again.. I hope !

The wolves entered the Endangered list in neighboring India in the 1970s, so the possibility of the few remaining Indian Greys crossing int boundaries just to move back to hostile territories where they went extinct decades ago- in search of a home that no longer exists seem hiiighly unlikely, right? FYI, the Black buck, *Antilope cervicapra*, the fav prey of these wolves also went extinct in Bangladesh during early 20th century.  

But a wildlife photographer rediscovered a lone *Canis lupus pallipes* in the Bangladesh portion of the Sundarbans, the mangrove forest on the GBM delta, in 2017. But in June, 2019, villagers in the Sundarbans killed an Indian Grey. Local experts don't think it was the same lone wolf seen in 2017. There's been speculations among the natives that 3-4 clans of wolves live in the Mangroves. So how can a handful of *Canis lupus pallipes* even survive in the salt water Mangroves, then?

Btw wildlife conservation is extremely difficult around here, as the need to feed and house the massive native population shrinks wildlife habitats and keep fuelling human-predator conflicts. There's very little tropical deciduous forests left in the country, where the wolves once reigned. I'm curious about the harmful changes/consequences due to the extinction of keystone predators in the country's vulnerable ecosystems, but there seems to be little to no hq literature on the issue.

* **Introduction:** 

The agents of human infectious disease [bacteria](https://www.biologyseba.com/2020/04/structure-of-bacterial-cells.html)

 belong to five major groups of organisms ,and these are **fungi, bacteria, protozoa, helminths,and viruses.**

Bacteria is present in the prokaryote kingdom.

Depending upon the shape, bacteria are classified into three basic groups, these are cocci, bacilli, spirochetes.

The size of bacteria varies from about 0.2 to 5 μm.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m0gotfqfpl551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a47dd9a0d17cc6653114c84a1f85d9f83a24b9f

The size of the smallest **bacteria** (Mycoplasma) and the largest viruses (poxviruses) are almost same.The longest **bacteria** rods are the size of some yeasts and human RBC.

* **Structure of bacteria:**

## Cell wall of the bacteria: 

## This the outermost component which is present in all the bacteria (except Mycoplasma species).

The significance of this complex bacterial cell wall are to protect the protoblasts from external noxae, which then help to withstand and to maintain the osmotic pressure gradient between the cell interior and the extracellular environment, to give the cell it's outer form and to facilitate communication with its surrounding.

Some bacteria have surface features external to the cell wall, such as **capsule**, **flagella and pili.**

The cell wall is located external to the cytoplasmic membrane and is made up of **peptidoglycan**.

# Cytoplasmic membrane:

The cytoplasmic membrane is present just inside the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall.It is composed of phospholipid bilayer similar in microscopic appearance to that in eukaryotic cells.

## Cytoplasm of bacteria:

When observed through the electron microscope it is seen that the cytoplasm of the bacteria has two distinct areas , these are,

1. An **amorphous matrix**, in which ribosomes, nutrient granules, metabolites and plasmids are present.
2. An **inner, nucleoid region** which is composed of DNA.

## Ribosomes:

The ribosomes of the **bacteria** are the place, where protein synthesis takes place, like the eukaryotic cells. But the chemical composition and the size of the **bacterial** are different from that of eukaryotic ribosomes.

The size of bacterial ribosomes is 70S , and contains 50S and 30S subunits, but the size of the eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S , and it contains 60S and 40S subunits.

## Granules:

## Nucleoid:

This is the area of the cytoplasm in the bacteria in which DNA is located.The DNA which is present in the prokaryotes ,are circular molecule,and which has a molecular weight of about 2 × 10\^9 and also contains about 2000 genes.There is resemblance to the eukaryotic nucleus becuse in the nucleoid nuclear membrane, nucleolus ,mitotic spindle, histone are not present.

There is no introns present in the **bacterial** DNA.

## Plasmids:

Plasmids are extra chromosomal, double-stranded , circular DNA molecules that are capable of replicating independently of the bacterial chromosome.Although plasmids are usually extra chromosomal, they can be integrated into the bacterial chromosome.In both gram positive and gram negative bacteria plasmids occur, and several different types of plasmid can exist in one cell these are 

1.Transmissible plasmids

2. Neurotransmissible plasmids.

## Transposons:

Transposons are prices of DNA , that move fastly from one site to another either within or between the DNAs of **bacteria**, plasmids and bacteriophages.They are nicknamed as ''jumping genes'' because of their unusual ability to move.Transposons can code for drug resistance enzymes, toxins or a variety of metabolic enzymes and can either cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alert the expression of nearby genes.There is four identifiable domains present in the transposons

* **Structure out side the cell wall:**

## Capsule:

It is a gelatinous layer present surrounding the entire **bacterium**.The capsule is composed of polysaccharide (except in the anthrax bacillus).The capsule is important because of it's four important role

 1.It is determinant of virulence of many **bacteria** since it limits the ability of phagocytes to engulf the bacteria.

 2.By using antiserum against the capsular polysaccharides , specific identification of an organisms can be made.

  3.In certain vaccines capsular polysaccharides are used as antigens , because of their role in eliciting protective antibodies.

   4.In the adherence of **bacteria** to the human tissues, capsule has an important role, which is an important primary step in causing infections.

## Flagella:

Flagella are long, whip-like appendages that help in the movement of **bacteria** toward nutrient and other attractants,a process which is known as chemotaxis.The long filament, which acts as a propeller,is composed of many subunits of a single protein,flagellin.

Flagellated **bacteria** have a characteristic number and location of flagella.

Flagella are medially important for two reasons

 1.Some species of motile **bacteria** are common causes of urinary tract infections.

 2.Some species of **bacteria** are identified in the clinical laboratory by the use of specific antibodies against flagellar proteins.

## Pili:

Pili are hair like filaments that extend from the cell surface.They are shorter and straighter than flagella,and are made up of pilin.

Pili have two main role:

  1.They regulate the attachment of bacteria with the specific receptor present on the human cell surface.

  2.A specialized kind of pilus,the sex pilus, forms the attachment between the male and the female **bacteria** during conjugation.

## Glycocalyx(Slime layer) of bacteria:

 It is a polysaccharide coating that is secreted by many **bacteria**. The glycocalyx is an important component of biofilms.

The glycocalyx mediates adherence of certain **bacteria**.

## Bacterial spores: 

## These highly resistance structures are formed in response to adverse conditions by two genera of medially important gram positive rods: the genus Bacillus and the genus Clostridium.",1,2020-06-18 00:03:25,biology

3405,hb2x3s,[Concept Introduction: Hidden Biology] We must abolish vertebrate elitism!," Imagine you are a sentient sponge. A unique and amazing organism full of mystery and evolutionary wonder. Curious humans harvest you from the ocean. Some poke at you and eventually use complex biological research methods to figure you out. They declare you a primitive animal. 

“That’s rude” you say, “I’m not primitive! I’m a god damn modern masterpiece.”

The humans scoff. “You’ve barely reached multicellularity and have little to no specialization. Of course you are primitive.”, “You don’t even have a nervous system, or muscles, or adaptive immunity, or symmetry!”

“You don’t even know me! You’re only pointing out what I don’t have.”

What the humans didn’t know is that the sponge held many interesting and new developments since they diverged from the last common ancestor. New features unique to the spongy kingdom. Funny things those humans. They always look for primitive versions of themselves that they ignore unique developments in modern life. Plotting a path along the tree of life that perfectly fits human evolution. 

How did our brain evolve? Let us look at the descending path of nervous systems from ape to mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, lamprey, amphioxus, etc. While these guys may hold remnants of the primitive brain, it is easy to forget that these are all modern organisms. They may have evolved new features that we ignore because we are looking for genes and physiology homologous to humans. 

Keep in mind: Biologists use MODEL organisms. Not the original ancestor. The further down the tree of life we go, the more chance there are new and unique features. But if we are only looking for homology, we will overlook those features. This the idea of hidden biology. Created usually by a bilaterian, vertebrate, or human centric view of biological research. Here is a neat visual:

It was mentioned that the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract is lined with four types of cell layers, namely mucosa, sub-mucosa, muscularis and mesothelium. I have two questions related to this topic:

1. Are the cells lining the inside of the mouth and tongue are a part of the mucosa, and if yes can simple foods like sugar be absorbed in the mouth itself?
2.  If the cells lining the inside of mouth and tongue are a part of the mucosa, are the taste buds present in the tongue are formed due to the irregular folds of the mucosa, similar to rugae and villi?

My biology instructor and I are having a disagreement. I say that since a siren is incapable of affecting a tornado the tornado+siren system is just stimulus/response, that without a loop or any feedback it can't be a feedback loop. I am told that since the stimulus (tornado) pushes the siren out of its normal state to which it returns when the tornado passes, it is a positive feedback loop.

This seems very wrong to me. If this is in fact correct, then any stimulus/response that reverts to its original state without the stimulus is a positive feedback loop. A switch+light is a positive feedback loop. The sun+a warm day is a positive feedback loop. All without any looping or feeding back necessary. Or am I crazy?",4,2020-06-16 18:15:31,biology

3466,haei5v,On the impact of biology research,"Hey r/biology

I am a rising 4th year student in computer science and mathematics, who is aspiring to become a computer scientist and even though I have a scientific curiosity that need to be fed independently and understand the importance of basic research with no applications in mind and its influence on modern science and technology, I have been having some strong feelings and finding it a little hard to justify doing research that most likely won't have an impact on people's lives (in a good way, doing algorithms research for Facebook or increasing the performance of ML systems that are quite far removed from being applied in practice doesn't count for example)

After thinking about it for a while I realized how important it is for me to not only pursue my scientific curiosities but also have an impact on people's lives and come to realize that biology provides what is quite possibly one of the finest balances between these two, where I find myself quite interested whenever I read about new advances in biology, and there is no question that research in many areas of biology has quite possibly the greatest rate of direct implications on people's lives among all the sciences. I am aware that with all research comes the risk that you produce nothing of value, but the premise of a lot of the research in biology seems to me worth the risk . So my questions are:

1. Is my view of biology research naive? I understand that not all biology research has direct implications and there is a lot of research that is purely basic research, but I imagine that its easier for biology students to participate in research with high potential of making an impact on people's lives, no?
2. How impactful do you think your research is, and briefly what is it on?
3. How hard would it be for a computer science and math student having taken no course in biology (but willing to spend whatever time to learn, I am a quick self-learner) to do research in biology (by going to grad school in biology or other departments that will allow me to do biology research). Note that  I am aware of computational biology, but having gone over the problems the field deals with briefly it doesn't seem to catch my attention (remember I am trying to balance my scientific curiosity with impact, otherwise I would have went to med school :p) What about fields that are further away from CS and math like molecular biology, I have heard of people making such switches like Venki Ramakrishnan and Francis Crick (Physics to Structural biology) however physics to structural biology is much closer of a switch than CS and math to any non-comp bio field, also these were exceptional people..
4. How do you see advances in computer science affecting your field, biology in general, and medicine (I know this is not the best sub to ask about medicine, but while we are at it..)?

All in all I am finding it extremely hard to justify not working on scientific questions relating to elevating the human condition.

Any input would be appreciated.

I was never really able to find supporting research, but I have two theories;

1. The caffeine made the environment basic enough to affect the E. coli’s cellular processes; or

2. The caffeine increased the uptake of streptomycin into the bacteria.

I know that caffeine increases the effectiveness of certain painkillers (Its mixed often with acetaminophen and Ibuprofen), so I’m leaning more towards this explanation.

I am currently doing an internship at a marine research lab as a chemist and have been tasked to find a suitable alternative to stain the macrozoobenthos samples with. They are currently using Rose bengal in a formalin solution (I believe 20% seawater with perhaps a little sodiumborate). This causes all samples to colour bright pink/red-ish. Sometimes the samples will not have colour at all making sorting them out kind of a pain. This is most common in samples with lots of sediment and clay.

I was wondering if anyone could help me find out how this colour comes to be or at least push me in the right direction of finding out. According to most literature I've read Rose bengal is pretty much always used for staining these sort of samples and I aim to find out why and see if there is indeed a better alternative.

3530,h9n6rt,I created a subreddit for the science behind cryptids,"[r/ScienceBehindCryptids](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceBehindCryptids/)

I made a post earlier today if anyone would be up for a subreddit for the science behind cryptids. Basically a problem with cryptids is that discussions are often clouded by people which make exaggerate or paranormal claims regarding cryptids which works against any discussion from a scientific point of view about sighted cryptids. Are they a hoax, a known animal which is misidentified as an extinct animal, or are there perhaps some animals which we haven't discovered yet which are only sighted as cryptids? That is what I created this place for, paranormal claims and creationism are explicitly not allowed, to avoid any claims of ""aliens"" or ""interdimensional beings"" which you see in some other cryptid subs. This cryptid sub tries to go off from a scientific basis, in which people can look at the claims in the sightings, the habitat and so on and compare it with the extinct species to see if there is any scientific background for the claims being made.

There are some former cryptids which turned out to exist, so it would be very interesting if some people interested in biology would be interested to participate in discussions on cryptids to see what the science is behind these claims.

I don't believe in nonsense like creationism and aliens (*not how aliens are presented in these kind of theories or bigfoot as an ""interdimensional being"", any aliens out there are probably too far away from us*). What I would be interested in would be if we had a subreddit with serious discussion on the science behind cryptids, but not being merely a debunking sub for the mere purpose of debunking in itself, but a sub to debunk those theories for cryptids which are obviously wrong, but also look at which cryptids might in fact have some scientific background to be remotely possible.

My issue basically is, cryptozoology seems to be clouded by the wacky idiots which try to tie their creationist agenda or speculative, unverifiable and unfalsifiable paranormal claims. This fogs the part of cryptids and cryptozoology which are actually concerned with genuinely possible animals to still exist within the realm of science. An example is the giant octopus or the kraken which is within the scientific possibilities.

Are there any more people interested in this which would like to moderate such a subreddit in which we look at the science behind unidentified animal (witness accounts) and cryptids? This would mean that for example a discussion on bigfoot, the pros and cons for the existence is possible, but that any claims of bigfoot being an interdimensional being would not be allowed, because that is an unfalsifiable and paranormal claim which is not fitting with any of our biological knowledge of how species work. Another example would be the discussion of possible surviving non-avian dinosaurs. Discussion about that would be possible, but a non-avian dinosaur which would have survived would just like a coelacanth not disprove evolution and therefore creationist propaganda would have to be removed.

The biggest concern which I would have for a sub like this would be, despite how highly interesting it would be for the scientific aspect, how hard it would be to moderate with people trying to tie in their creationism.",1,2020-06-15 11:04:28,biology

I am a high school student. This is the depth of my textbook's kidney subchapter:

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1: The role of the kidney in urine production.

\- The purposes of the kidney.

\- Nephron anatomy.

\- Urine-making operations: (filtration) + (re-absorption) + (tubular secretion).

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2: The role of hormones in regulating kidney function:

\- ADH.

\-RAAS.

\- ANF.

&amp;#x200B;

The textbook has no figures (pictures) to illustrate what is happening, and the few pictures it has are black and white and low resolution. I don't get what gets filtered, where and where/why it gets reabsorbed. And tubular secretion is too vaguely explained.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, I don't understand anything on those ADH/RAAS/ANF hormones. When does each one fire? And what they actually increase/decrease? And which one counteracts each other?

They define it like this

&gt; First, an organism adapts to a changing environment by altering its gene expression to change its phenotype — its form or behaviour. Second, a gene emerges that locks in that phenotypic change. Finally, the gene spreads through the population.

Now I have no problem with the first step. An organism's gene expression is altered through forced behavioral change that results in a phenotype change. But how does the new emergent gene have anything to do with the prior genotypic alteration, other than it serves a similar purpose? Wouldn't that emergent gene be selected for regardless of epigenetic(if that's the correct term) changes to the phenotype, simply because of the initial change in environment leading to increased fitness for that gene? 

Or is it all about sexual selection, where the emergent gene is selected for breeding as a result of the shared epigenetic behavior. That doesn't really make sense to me.",11,2020-06-14 20:37:55,biology

It is generally agreed that there are about 20000 protein-coding sequences in the human genome (although this number is subject to update and not a final number by a long shot).

I wonder what is the level/nature of duplication in the data bank. Of course there are functional mutations of the same protein such that slightly different sequences may have been uploaded by different uploaders. But I would like to treat them as the same protein and see what total count I get as a result.

I'm also wondering how the deposit process works. If I deposit a protein sequence, does RCSB do any double check or template-matching search to make sure it's not a duplicate or 99% similar to an existing protein? Or is it free for all?

Has anyone attempted to download the whole data bank, process the sequences to eliminate functional duplicates?

My best guess is that after the duplicates are eliminated, we may still not have all the proteins of single human (i.e., the total number might drop below 20000?)

A side question: If I want to find the sequences of all proteins in a single human genome, we can use the publically available human genomes, but then has anyone done the transcription+translation and counted the number of proteins (of course it's not an easy task, with the splicing, post-translations modifications and what not, but still. Feel free to comment. Thanks).

**edit**: I guess, the genome-to-proteome (all in silico) is more complicated than it initially appeared to me. Do we have comprehensive knowledge of which mRNA are non-translating, so the rest translate into proteins. Does de novo protein folding need to be carried out for obscure proteins because no experimental data is available?

I also don't really understand the biology of the B cell receptor, but antibodies perform their functions through affinity for a ligand and localization to that ligand (be it free-floating or attached to something larger). They don't send a signal through to the Fc domain through a conformational change, right? SO my question is: how does the CAR propagate a signal across the membrane to the CD3 domain in order to stimulate the CD3 domain if it looks like the recognition domain is sort of just loosely attached to the transmembrane domain, like through an unstructured linker. That'd be like saying ""the receptor binds the ligand and sends a signal through the [GPI anchor](https://www.google.com/search?q=gpi+anchor&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS848US848&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02LsQWZHXhwVRWnh3WYL2EP_0sMew:1592146673801&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjw7K_HyIHqAhWzQjABHeU6Bk4Q_AUoAnoECBMQBA&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=832#imgrc=1CRXvmBy1kY0rM) to the intracellular domain"".

3658,h8i3bo,"If both strands of DNA in a double-stranded molecule begin at their 5' end and terminate at their 3' end, why is only one strand designated as the ""forward"" strand? What are the criteria for this?","I've recently been working on a bioinformatics project, and part of my job is to retrieve information about specific proteins and the genes that encode them (these proteins are from two different species of bacteria). I'm using SnapGene to view GenBank files that contain genome sequences for each of these bacterial species, and I've noticed that directionality has been specified for each gene (i.e. forward/reverse) to indicate the strand on which the gene is found in the genome.

I understand that, by convention, the ""forward strand"" appears as 5'-&gt;3' (with 5' on the left and 3' on the right) and the ""reverse strand"" appears as 3'-&gt;5' (with 3' on the left and 5' on the right) in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule. However, I don't understand how this notation is kept consistent across different databases and different species. **What prevents either strand from being viewed as the ""forward"" strand by different people?** (i.e. in the same way that either strand can be the ""coding"" or ""template"" strand, depending on the strand being transcribed).

Since each complementary, antiparallel strand in a dsDNA molecule technically runs from 5'-&gt;3' (especially when you can just change the physical orientation of the molecule so that either strand has its 5' end is on the ""left""), **what criteria is used to permanently designate one strand, but** **not the other, as ""forward""?**

I've been searching through university notes, multiple biochemistry/cell biology/genetics textbooks and academic literature, and I haven't found a satisfying answer--I would be incredibly grateful towards those who can provide clarification for me on this topic!

NOTES:

* I've seen some people on other online forums claim that the ""forward"" strand has its 5' end at the end of the short arm in a Eukaryotic chromosome, but \[A\] I don't believe this applies to bacteria and \[B\] I don't know enough about the orientation of DNA in chromosomes to verify this.
* Furthermore, I've seen others claim that the assignment of ""forward/reverse"" is arbitrary. I currently don't think this is true, based on my understanding of[ Illumina's sequencing by synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8) procedure, which depends on being able to consistently differentiate between DNA fragments with different directionalities.
* I've also seen people claim that, for bacteria, directionality comes from the direction of replication, but this doesn't make sense to me based on my understanding of the[ bi-directional nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWuju1S9_E) of bacterial replication.",5,2020-06-13 18:08:34,biology

And I like biology altough I probably don't want to make researches in lab or sth like that. Don't get me wrong I like working in lab, just don't want my whole life be stuck at lab.

So my question is, should I pair my future biology degree with some business degree or with informatics? Both interest me and doing bioinformatics/data science seems much more enjoyable to me than biology and research work in lab. 

But with the business degree the possibilities seems to be much wider, I mean I could do almost anything, right?

3708,h83vcr,Epigenetics vs phenotypic plasticity,"Can someone explain the difference.

As I understand it, phenotypic plasticity = the ability for environmental factors to alter the expression of a gene during an organisms development, therefore altering ontogeny and creating different phenotypes under different conditions. The phenotype is life long but not heritable, however the plastic gene and therefore response to environment is heritable. Species with high plasticity can therefore tolerate wider ranges of environmental factors and thus it can help adaptation occur in other genes, by allowing existence of the species outside of the range it would be constrained to without the plastic gene.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what she said about epigenetics confused me a little: all she said was that it provides a mechanism for phenotypic plasticity. So to me epigenetics is the mechanism that alters expression, i,e high heat in the environment during development, stimulates hormone production which stimulates a response within a cell by, for example: changing mrna, trna or even protein structure / expression leading to a different developmental path and therefore lasting structure within an organism.

But then she said it causes lasting and heritable change. I.e a plant expressing epigenetic tolerance for higher heat will have offspring with this tolerance, even if they are not in a high heat environment, (this obviously contradicts phenotypic plasticity). This also means it must cause changes in DNA somehow that are present germ cells.

So my questions are:

1. How is epigenetic change passed to gametes.
2. Does epigenetics govern phenotypic plasticity i.e non heritable change due to environment as well as heritable change, and if so does it just depend on where the mechanism causes changes in protein expression, i,e at the DNA level or after translation has occurred?
3. Is epigenetic change ever reversible, either in the organism it originated in, or between generations, if so how?",0,2020-06-13 03:50:10,biology

3710,h83a41,Are bones made before flesh or both of them are formed simultaneously during embryonic development ? Any references are appreciated.," I was provided the following statements.  How accurate are these?

&gt; In the book (2016) -“Developmental Approach to Human Evolution”, by professor Julia Boghner (Department of Anatomy and cell Biology, University of Sakatchewan) and professor Campbell Rolian ( Department of Comperative Biology and Experimental Medicine, University of Calgary), they stated that-

&gt; The signalling for bone formation is present earlier then the signalling for muscle formation. Cartilage (pre-bone) is present , before the muscle formation.

&gt; Limb muscle progenitor cell don't have any information about position. The first tissue cell that subsequently condensed to form bone provides positional information for soft tissue formation.

&gt; Page 122–123.

&gt; “After initial outgrowth stages are completed, limb buds and segments continue to elongate and morphological features such as hand/foot plates, and joints of the proximal and distal limbs (e.g., elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle) become identifiable. During this time, cells in respective stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod compartments coalesce to form separate pre‐chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. These condensations are shaped via joint development, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis to produce the many separate skeletal elements of the limb, although how this occurs is only poorly understood. At the same time, muscle and tendon cells begin to migrate into compartments of the limb to form its muscles.”

&gt; So, seems pre-bone formation occur at first. Then muscle progenitor cell migrates toward it by receiving the signal from the bone, then it cover the bones and starts to form muscle cell.",6,2020-06-13 03:00:39,biology

3792,h78s7r,A Zoophile (animal sex lover) on Reddit once said...,"&gt;The gist of zoonosis is that if the animal has a zoonotic disease, you're going to get it from simply being around them and taking care of them as opposed through only sexual contact. There is no zoonotic disease that is ONLY transmitted through sexual contact. There are vaccines for most of them, and even ignoring that, they mainly crop up in third world countries or when someone is neglecting an animal. Further, if one is afraid of zoonotic diseases due to bestiality, if the person is being consistent, then they're hopefully a lifelong celibate vegan who lives isolated from other people. You're far more likely to get sick from eating undercooked/contaminated animal products, being around other humans, or having sex. 

&gt;Ah, now you've admitted to it being gross and illegal. Gross shows you're being bigoted (reason why homosexuality was banned). And btw, legality doesn't equal right or wrong so you can't really use that in the argument (again gay marriage used to be illegal in the US). All ZOOSEXUALS are kind and never force sex on their partners, whom they love &amp; very likely take better care of than non-zoos do with their pets. As zoosexuals, we hate the ones that hurt animals. Just like we'd hate human rapists.

&gt;Zoosexuality isn't a mental disorder. Most zoos are perfectly happy and healthy, even as they speak about it with their therapists. Saying that all zoos are mentally ill is literally just like how we used to say all gays were mentally ill. All in all, in the future I can see a society where we'd finally realize that zoosexuality is a valid sexual orientation and only ppl who ACTUALLY hurt their animals will go to jail/pet taken away. Ppl will look back to this time period and can't believe so many people were against zoosexuals.

Hey everyone, I bought a heart rate monitor at the start of lockdown as I was doing lots of training and thought it might provide some interesting data.

When weight training I've noticed an odd recovery in my heart rate. When doing reps the heart rate increases consistently as expected. However when I stop, every single time, there is an odd bump in the recovery. I have tried googling to find out what may be causing it but no luck and I was hoping someone here could shed some light on it.

An example of what I'm talking about can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/iOtUu6X

I've labelled it to make it easier to understand;  
1) Start reps (10 each)  
2) Stop reps  
3) The bump in recovery can be seen the whole way along the chart.  

There is exactly 2 minutes between the start of reps each time. The heart rate monitor is not a watch, its one worn around the upper arm for improved accuracy. As I have been aware of the bump appearing in the graph I have been making a concious effort to not do anything unusual between reps. So the bump is not caused by moving around or drinking water etc.

I'm really curious to know what causes the blip in recovery. Should I be concerned? Or is this perfectly normal? If so what is the physiological reason for it happening?

I’ve read other threads that highly recommend computer science as a minor, but I strongly believe that isn’t for me. I currently hold a unique job that allows me to work closely with reptiles and amphibians, and I love many aspects of the job, however it pays very little so I need to focus on getting a higher paying job soon.

As an example of what job I’m looking for, I love finding and catching salamanders and I recently spoke to a biologist who’s job is conservation (particularly of salamanders) and that is basically my dream job. Of course I have heard that that’s not an easy industry to get hired in consistently, but I am hoping with the correct minor and my years of experience with animals that I may be able to get my foot in the door.

A friend and I recently started a seminar series on Twitch, which we call [ThinksWithTwitch](https://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch). It's a quarantine-friendly version of an in-person series my friend used to do at her place. Each Thursday night we bring on one of our friends to give a short talk about their research in some area of STEM followed by a Q&amp;A. This week we have a topic that I think might be of interest to people in this subreddit. If you're interested we'd love it if you'd come by during the stream and ask questions!

Speaker: Bharath Ramsundar

Title: Open Sourcing Medicine Discovery

Where: [twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch](http://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch)

When: Thursday 6/11, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: Discovering new medicine has traditionally required the use of proprietary methods and software. This reliance on proprietary techniques stops companies and academics from easily sharing know-how between projects, slows down the discovery of new medicine and raises costs. The DeepChem project aims to build an open source foundation for medicine discovery by creating a high quality suite of software and protocols that can enable scientists and engineers to work together to find better medicine faster.

3895,h0ecy1,[Serious] What can we do to increase racial equality in higher education for STEM? #ShutDownSTEM,"As a liberal-art-educated biology researcher, this question has been gnawing at me for some years now. I work in a big academic institute that hires hundreds of researchers and, although I have not met everyone, I can count the number of black researchers around me in one hand. To provide some context, the setting is in a big liberal city in America, with many workers being foreign nationals. 

As a non-underrepresented minority (sorry for the double negatives), I feel strongly for racial justice and equality. I also understand that there have been MANY systematic issues that contribute to the current inequality and hold black Americans back from good education (i.e. personal safety concerns, lack of supportive environment, financial instability, imbalanced resource distribution, just to name a few).  

Of the shamefully few black Americans I encountered in my relatively young career, I’ve made a friend who is a wonderful researcher and medical doctor. I have also mentored a terribly unqualified post-graduate student that looked perfect on paper with lots of research experience, who had a hard time grasping the concept of the most basic methods (think PCR or cell dissociation) after multiple people EILI5. This may be my privilege speaking, but here is where my conflicts come from and I truly want to educate myself by starting an open and honest conversation. 

Can we promote equality and acknowledge the unjust starting point of education while maintaining the quality of higher education? Is it right to have two different standards because of someone’s skin color? If so, is that truly just or would that be another form of racism? If not, what can we do to support black Americans in STEM so that they can catch-up in higher education? 

My apologies in advance if this post angers anyone—that is not my intention. However, I do think that uncomfortable conversations help us understand each other and, hopefully, grow closer as a community.",27,2020-06-10 11:31:03,biology

At least with moths and butterflies, there are some more substantive differences in their behavior and morphology to determine which animal goes where. It’s not just a “the Madagascan sunset moth is pretty, so it deserves to be called a butterfly.”

In Spanish, both doves and pigeons are called “paloma” (which really makes more sense). And in Chinese, a goose is an 鹅 and a swan is a 天鹅, so there’s an obvious shared etymology.

Are there any geese that could pass as swans? Or vice versa, are there any swans someone might mistake as a goose? Why were black swans not called black geese? I get that swans connote beauty, but I don’t think that’s a valid way to determine an animal’s genus.

So, after DNA-recombination and the necessary genetic engineering have been done and we have gotten our transgenic plant, we now need to produce these transgenic plants at a mass-scale. 

Tissue culture isn't a good way of doing that because it is expensive. So, we have to produce seeds through sexual reproduction. 

Now, there are three possible outcomes if two glyphosate-resistant transgenic plants undergo sexual reproduction:-

1. A glyphosate-resistant seed is produced which contains only glyphosate-resistant genes.
2. A glyphosate-resistant seed is produced which contains both the glyphosate-resistant gene and the non-glyphosate-resistant gene.
3. A non-glyphosate-resistant seed is produced.

 If one were to mix human DNA with skin cells from mice, would the skin cells be able to grow? Would it be safe to say that the skin cells would be able to grow using the human DNA? I would say that because DNA is DNA, the skin cells might be able to use the human DNA if the skin cells find DNA that they could use to build proteins. However, this could come with complications, as it could lead to multiple copies of proteins that the skin cells would use, thus jeopardizing the skin cells. Also, there could be a chance that the foreign DNA could be broken down or alter the cells enough that they would be deemed unfavorable, and thus be destroyed. There could also be a possibility that the skin cells might have too much DNA, as they could try to incorporate the human DNA, thus causing the cells to be destroyed.",6,2020-06-09 04:57:24,biology

My parents helped me pay for college and I have no debt. My parents' family income is high even for this area.

I am thinking of becoming a scientist/researcher. I have no experience in the industry. I am struggling to find a job here. In order to get more options or find better jobs, I would have to get a Masters or a Ph.D. 

In general, I am would like to get to work ASAP and move out and start living. 

I am open to changing careers, particularly Computer Engineering even if it means starting over. 

I am willing to work for a few years make some money and go back to college for another bachelor's in Computer engineering.

Should I focus on getting a job in this industry? 

Should I pursue even more higher education?

Why would the virus not allow immunity? Wouldn't this be bad for it, since it takes a while for lungs to heal from the damage, and getting infected again after a few weeks or months would cause a cumulative effect?

4049,gyn6co,Could cell phones cause oxidative stress which can lead to cancer?,"I have been worrying about this for a while, so I want to know what you all think, is this study worrying? (This isn't the only one, I believe there to be about 4 more). Before you ask, the theory is that these results indicate oxidative stress which can cause cancer. Study:

### Background

Nowadays mobile phone is very popular, causing concern about the effect it has on people’s health. Parotid salivary glands are in close contact to cell phone while talking with the phone and the possibility of being affected by them. Limited studies have evaluated the effect of cell phone use on the secretions of these glands; so this study was designed to investigate the effects of duration of mobile phone use on the total antioxidant capacity of saliva.

### Methods

Unstimulated saliva from 105 volunteers without oral lesions collected. The volunteers based on daily usage of mobile phones were divided into three groups then total antioxidant capacity of saliva was measured by Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) method. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 19. ANOVA was used to compare 3 groups and post-hoc Tukey test to compare between two groups.

### Results

Average total antioxidant capacities of saliva in 3 groups were 657.91 µmol/lit, 726.77 µm/lit and 560.17 µmol/lit, respectively. The two groups had statistically significant different (*P* = 0.039).

### Conclusion

Over an hour talking with a cell phone decreases total antioxidant capacity of saliva in comparison with talking less than twenty minutes.

Hey everyone! I hope it's okay to post this here, I'd love some perspectives on my particular situation as I've read a lot of opinions and am going over some ideas about a career change.

I'm currently in my late 20s, working as a freelance content writer/occasional journalist and am finding it far less steady and fulfilling than I'd hoped.

I've been taking stock of things while in lockdown and am considering trying out a career shift into lab tech work.

Now, I graduated with a BA in English and haven't studied sciences since school. By far my best science was biology, and I'd be interested in the idea of working in a biosciences/medical lab as an assistant/technician.

From what I can see on job boards in the UK, there are positions open for apprenticeships or entry-level positions which don't require any particular experience.

I'm looking at possibilities for study and am considering taking a biology diploma/access/refresher course and then perhaps even trying for a biology degree with the Open University (distance learning) while getting an entry-level job, as it's far more affordable and flexible than a standard degree.

Now, I still absolutely have to consider if this would be a wise move, especially as my science skills are extremely rusty (I've been going over school-level biology in preparation and finding it really engaging so far, but some kind of formal study seems wise. I'd definitely get my feet wet in the field before making any drastic moves in any case). I have a few concerns/questions:

\-Would a distance learning course in science be any good at all for someone who's interested in lab tech work? The degrees I'm looking at involve occasional lab placements, but no sustained lab experience. I thought perhaps an apprenticeship/entry-level lab tech position would be good to do alongside a part-time degree, if I decide to go that route. It would also show an interest in science to potential employers.

\-A lot of people say lab tech work is unfulfilling, is that always the case? I really want to do something where I feel I'm contributing to something worthwhile, and even if I was cleaning a lab and organising samples, etc. I feel that would be a lot more fulfilling than anything else I can feasibly imagine doing. Am I glamorising it too much?

\-A lot of people say there's little (if any) room for career advancement in lab tech work, but is that necessarily true? I'm not too concerned about salary as long as I can cover my basic needs and feel like I'm doing worthwhile work.

Thanks so much in advance for reading my long post, and I'd love any input people can give. I will absolutely consider whether my science skills are strong enough before making any long-term decisions, but would just like some input at this early stage.

4092,gy8s6h,Best friend recently passed away due to COVID19 and I'm wondering if it was painful or not. Help,"My friend recently passed away, and I want to know if ''Silent Hypoxia'' is painful. Here's a quick article on this subject since it is something that is unique to COVID19/the Coronavirus: https://www.physoc.org/blog/hypoxic-happiness-covid19/

My best friend became sick two weeks ago, at first, he seemed to be getting better, fever was going down, cough was getting weaker, etc.

Then one of the nights he messaged me, saying that he felt weird, and that his skin around his lips and fingers was turning this blue shade. He said he was scared of hospitals and if he was going to die that he was going to die in his own bed. Anyway he said he was going to go to bed because he felt sleepy and ''buzzy''. He was later found dead and he was blue and his lungs had these black spots all over them and they were really swollen up. Cause of death was suffocation.

I just now looked up this phenomenon and I'm wondering what it feels like. Did he feel like he was drowning or did he feel pains like you do when you hold your breath? I have sort of a phobia of that feeling and I'm really hoping he passed away peacefully and wasn't fully aware of what was going on and he wasn't scared or in distress when he died.",81,2020-06-07 03:50:30,biology

4097,gy57md,"Looking for marine field work experience, in the US, that pays well? Become a Protected Species Observer!","Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you've gotten everything certified you'll probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I've been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I've had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I've seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

If this sounds like something you want more info on as a career, feel free to comment here, or DM me. Im in port until Tuesday so Ill answer what I can. Ill be offshore on a project for a few weeks and ill answer more when we return to port. You can also check out my instagram for pictures of wildlife i've seen offshore @ Barefoot\_zak.",6,2020-06-06 22:38:06,biology
4098,gy4h78,Why can't we reuse mask?," 

I've always ""knew"" that I should either use disposable mask, or sanitized them after every use. It's a very rooted educatoin as I survived SARS in Hogn Kong. Then I heard the opinion of someone else and logically, it seems like they are correct. And I am very confused right now.

We don't need to wash mask because virus, like COVID-19 needs a host to duplicate. So even if there is a few COVID-19 on there, they won't be able to duplicate. After say... 30 days, they will just starve to death. So reusing unwashed mask have a very low risk as the number of COVID 19 will remain few on the mask as they don't duplicate.

I could not argue with that logic. That got me thinking though, wouldn't that apply to all pathogen?

As a mask is not the ideal medium, wouldn't all pathogen be unable to duplicate much on a mask? Say if we were to soak the mask in some salted water first, wouldn't that hugely decrease the amount of pathogen who can survive being on the mask? And if we were to never wash the mask, would the waste product of the mask eventually makes whatever is living on the mask uninhabitable?

This not washing mask logic defied everything I have been taught. Please counter this logic.",8,2020-06-06 21:44:35,biology

Most companies trying to produce antibodies to combat COVID-19 have pinned their hopes on mass-producing identical copies of a single version, a so-called monoclonal antibody that homes in on and attaches tightly to a particular section of a virus. Instead of making just one antibody variety, the cows fashion polyclonal antibodies, a range of the molecules that recognize several parts of the virus. “That’s the natural way that our bodies fight disease,” Sullivan says. This diversity may make the cow’s proteins more powerful than monoclonal antibodies, he says, and they may remain effective even if a virus mutates.”

4117,gxx43d,Could we use viruses to increase expression and production of DNA checking enyzmes as treatment for cancers?,"Just a quesiton I suddenly started humouring before realising I actually don't have the knowledge yet to understand why something like this probably wouldn't work. 

I'm studying biomedical science and have recently done a fair amount of work on cancer so I'm basing my speculation only what I know from that - I do not have a complete understanding of the subject.

It's my understanding that we're able to treat certain diseases by inserting a gene into a virus and using it on a human to cause expression of that gene. It's also my understanding that a huge issue of treating cancers comes from being unable to distinguish between healthy and mutated cells as they barely differ externally in any ways that matter.

If we were to insert genes for DNA checking enzymes into cancer patients and stimulate their synthesis using viruses, in theory could we make more likely that mutated cells will be noticed by sheer number of increased checks? The logic being that it would cause no harm to healthy cells when they reproduce, but would be able to signal to have any mutated cells dealt with.

I suspect it wouldn't work since:

\- I'm not sure if quantity of DNA checks is the cause of mutations not being corrected

\- I don't know if the mechanism of DNA checking would allow for an increase of checks in this manner

\- I'm aware many cancerous mutations form resistance to apoptosis 

\- I'm not sure if using a virus as a vector would be suitable to 'infect' target cells with enough accuracy.

I figured this would be the best place to ask people who know a hell of a lot about this subject what the issue with this approach would be? I've done some basic research on how chemotherapies and immunotherapies work but that's about as far into treatments I've looked.

4121,gxw2ve,Is there a Good DNA Test for South Asians?!?," 

Ill start with these four postulates.

1. 23andMe and other DNA testing companies do not provide enough information on South Asian ancestry.
2. There isn't enough samples from South Asians to compare to in these DNA testing company databases.
3. Due to the fact that your DNA has too much information to deal with (and some of it is probably not relevant to your ancestry), the companies target specific regions of your genome that make individuals unique (SNPs).
4. These SNPs are described in the raw data file that the company provides.

SO my questions are:

1. Is the lack of specific information pertaining to South Asian ancestry caused because a lack of samples results in:  

   1. a lack of information to compare your data to?  

      1. *If only this point is the case, then I'm ecstatic, because I can just upload my raw data from a site like 23andMe to any other database online that has more South Asian samples to compare to.*
   2. a lack of information, and therefore an inability to determine which SNPs are required to provide specifics on South Asian ancestry (I'm assuming that the level of specificity in the provided information is related to the amount of SNP's \[and which SNPs\] targeted)?  

      1. *If this is the case then that sucks. I guess I can still upload my raw data to a database with more South Asian samples, but because of the fact that the SNPs that are targeted are not unique enough, I wont be able to get enough information or I wont get accurate information on my ancestry from any database no matter how full it is*
2. Which ancestry test would be the best to get a raw data file for a South Asian, and which database would be the best for uploading that raw data file?  

   1. *Although, if there is a testing company out there that provides a comprehensive enough analysis for South Asians (which I doubt), then you don't need to mention an external database.*
3. Do companies really give you ALL the SNP information in that raw data file, or do they leave out some information?",1,2020-06-06 13:16:30,biology

That being said I have a question.

What is the correct order that you are supposed to write a scientific report?

I am writing a report for my school and my teacher is being annoying. They laid out weird order to make the report so I just made the report in a random order that felt better doing, so if anyone could tell me the proper order that you should make a scientific report in then that would be appreciated :D

Just to be clear, my school did not tell me the correct order. the beginning is fine, they wanted me to pick a subject, method, and make the questions that the report is supposed to answer so that is fine. But then they wanted me to perform the lab, collect the data from the lab, write down the purpose of the lab after it is done which seems strange to do after the lab instead of before. And after the lab is done and I have written down the result, materiel, and method. Now they want me to delimit the purpose of the lab, and as the last thing, they want me to write the theory and refer to other research in the subject, discussion, abstract and the sources used.

So I am just a little confused

My impression is that you are supposed to pick the subject, method, purpose, questions, and do research on the subject before you do the lab itself but I am not sure. So anyone that wants to give me a step by step guide on how scientific report is supposed to be performed would be much appreciated.

Now I wrote before that I have done the lab and written the report so you might be wondering why I still want to know the order. Well... I am gonna rewrite the report because no matter what I do my teacher still seems to have something to complain about so I might as well remake it in the proper order so that I know it for future projects.

4164,gxfool,Due to lack of jobs I had to work at a slaughterhouse. Now I have biology/anatomy questions.,"I'm not too educated in biology other than the occasional articles I read, and the highschool education I have. I work as a bagger and trimmer at a slaughterhouse. I trim nasty stuff off the carcasses; cysts, fecal matter, pieces of hide, etc. I also sometimes vaccum seal the finished cuts some days. Working there I've noticed certain things that I never would have expected. Here's some of the questions I have.

1. Why does fat have such a low melting point?
1. A) how does the body keep fat solid? (If it does keep it solid 
1. B) when the body uses fat does it actually ""burn it"" or are the fat crystals broken apart at the molecular level? 

A lot of the fat from the lambs will melt in my hand and on my knife. Now I am grabbing and cutting through this meat so it's possible friction could generate some heat and cause some of the melting but I am not sure. It seems like a lot of the fat in the lambs should be liquid at the temperature their body stays at. 
My theory right now is that the fat cells have some sort of lining that surrounds them and keeps everything nice and orderly and solid like. But when these cells are cut the loose fat cells are released and any that are hot enough to melt spill out. I don't think each cell has a cell wall but maybe groups of cells form in pockets. 

2) Where does energy in a bled and headless body come from? 

After the lamb have been killed (I hate this makes me sad hope I can find a new job soon) they seize. The beheaded bodies often have muscle contractions for minutes at a time, I want to say twenty minutes(time also drags in there so maybe its shorter). The seizures start with flailing legs and near the end it's just muscle contractions in the glutes. If blood carrys energy for these cells what is powering these contractions? I assume muscle can store energy but the electrical signal they receive is what causes them to flex so where is that coming from? 

3) Why are kidneys enveloped in fat but other organs aren't?

This may be a lamb specific thing but I've never cut anything else open so I can't say for sure. I've noticed the kidneys have a thick layer of fat surrounding them. None of the other organs (that I've noticed) do. The liver is really delicate so I don't think the fat is protective or the liver would have the same thing, or so I would think? 
Maybe the kidneys just need a lot of energy? Or maybe it helps them filter better? 

I tried googling some of these things but didn't learn exactly what I was looking for. Thanks for anyone who's read this!",159,2020-06-05 18:32:03,biology

4167,gxfdra,Can someone help me identify this food spoilage colony?,"Around Christmas, I made a simple syrup infused with clementines by boiling clementines in a concentrated simple syrup.  I then put the simple syrup in a jar and left it in the fridge, occasionally pulling it out to use a tablespoon or two to sweeten a cocktail.

In the last month or so, unbeknownst to me, something began to grow in the jar which was sitting at the back of my fridge:

[https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E](https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E)

Initially I thought it might be some kind of crystallization as the syrup is very thick (consistency of a runnier honey). However, upon inspection I realized that it looks more like a bacterial colony, made up of tiny even-sized circular nodules. There is no apparent smell, but I mixed a small amount with water in a beaker and the resulting liquid is somewhat opaque (similar to a yeast slurry) whereas the original syrup was crystal clear when mixed with water. 

Does anyone have ANY idea what this might be? Could it be a wild yeast of some kind? Without a microscope or other microbiology tools, is there any way I can find out more about what this might be?

For what it's worth, since I suspected that it might be yeast I have left the resulting solution in a beaker to see if it begins to ferment. Overnight, there appears to have been no obvious fermentation activity. I'll update if that changes.

4174,gxd2mg,"From a transmission standpoint, is the Corona virus essentially as bad as it gets?","*I am not in any way trying to discuss how deadly the virus is or is not, but rather simply how very contagious it is in terms of ability to affect number of people.

I read somewhere that measles was considered one of the most contagious airborne viruses and the coronavirus is more contagious than even that. Reasons for this include its ability to rapidly multiply in the throat in a very short number of days which leads to spreading the viral load and also that the viral load contained per sneeze droplet on average was also extraordinarily high. In conjunction with the fact that the virus also has a random (and possibly quite long) number of days before someone may show symptoms (2-14 days) or even if they show symptoms at all, all the while the person remains potentially infectious to others, is this as bad as a virus can get in terms of spreading quickly?

Of course, it can be reasoned on the other hand that of in fact the virus had like a 95% kill rate it wouldn't spread very much at all because word about something with a death rate that high would stop it (more or less).

Tyrone Hayes published many studies claiming to show that low levels of the herbicide atrazine acts as a endocrine disruptor to the sexual development in African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). In his lectures, Hayes presents images of frogs with both testes and ovaries. A 2010 Hayes study concluded that atrazine rendered 75% of male frogs sterile and turned one in 10 into females.

The controversy emerges from Hayes claiming that other studies contending his findings were influenced by funding from Syngenta, the company that developed Atrazine. His case is pretty compelling as it's told in these two articles:

4206,gx22vn,A biological approach to philosophy and morality,"Hi there,

First post, have been developing these ideas over the last few years and I think it's time I took some feedback, for some basics about me, I'm 23, I've a degree in Biochemistry and I've always had a much more long term view of life than most, I'm not religious in any conventional sense, and although what I'm about to describe could be considered beliefs, I prefer to think of them as evidence based conclusions.

To begin I'd like to question the narrative put forward by religions to those who lacked faith for centuries, that without a belief in a higher power, something to judge our actions and determine them right or wrong based on its own rules, we would be lawless, hedonistic savages. This is of course, a baseless claim, but it brings up a good point, what is the ultimate goal, if not to pass a creators test?

I believe the answer has been in front of us since we discovered that we too, like the rest of life on this planet, are biological machines, with the instructions on how to build, maintain and operate these machines encoded in our DNA. It seems strange to me why philosophers have argued over what life's purpose is, when all of life's code is targeted towards a single goal, from the smallest Virus to the largest Mammal, the primary function of all life is to reproduce and spread.

""Great!"" I hear you say, ""so my purpose is to get out there and have kids? That's easy!"" and whilst yes, that is a way of fulfilling life's primary function, it is not the optimal way that we as modern humans can. You see, as far as we know, we are the only species not just capable of experiencing and understanding the universe, but also the only species with any chance of spreading conscious life beyond earth. 

That is what i believe our purpose is, simply put, if we stay on earth, we are limiting the amount of people that can ever live, that can ever experience life and the universe and that's why I believe it is not just our purpose, but our responsibility to dedicate our lives to ensuring that future becomes a reality.

This is where my view on Morality comes into play, as with a now definitive goal of life, the morality of an action is determined by its potential contribution to the goal, for example, actions that cause people harm are generally going to have a negative impact on the goal whilst actions that allow people to lead healthier, happier and better educated lives will contribute to that goal.

I'm sure there are caveats to this Moral basis, which I'm hoping you can point out, theories can't be developed without challenge, but so far I haven't been able to fault this system and in comparison to what else is available out there in terms of moral guidance, nothing fits my views like this.

Finally I'd just like to answer the question I wish more people would ask, ""What can I do to further humanity? To make my life have counted towards this goal?""

That's simple, help people, but further than that, try and make it your career to help people, there are so many ways of contributing in this way, working in STEM fields is the one I believe is most effective and accessible, but the world needs more than that, we need charity workers who care about the people alive today as well as those STEM workers focused on the future, we need politicians more concerned with a populations well-being than their reelection and we need social leaders who stand for progress instead of regression.

If you have read all of this, thank you, I do not usually share my thoughts on these matters but someone has to say these things, if you have responses to this or would like to hear more of my thoughts, please leave a reply, it would be much appreciated.",11,2020-06-05 05:32:01,biology

4214,gx02kz,Mayfly living more than 24h and still going,"Hi,

Not so long ago, I found an insect staying still near my window. I did not know what it was, so I decided to find out about it with an app. The app identified it as a 'Mayfly' and it said that it lives for only 24h after they transform into imago, mate and starve to death. 

Well, first day I saw it, I was expecting it to die the following day so I came to check the next morning and slightly touched it with a pen. It responded by moving its legs and tail. Then the day after I touched it again, and it was still alive. I almost forgot about it for a week, and it is still alive. Well, it just stays there still (unless I touch it). I'm guessing that the lack of physical activity allows it to live on its last remaining sources of energy, but it stays alive definitely more than 24 hours. I tried searching online about this type of lifespan case in mayflies but found nothing. Anybody could say more about this?",2,2020-06-05 02:36:47,biology

I started applying for jobs and have someone that told me my application was impressive and seemed really excited about me. But he asked for my unofficial transcript. Currently it has a 2.3 GPA on it and shows that I've been on and off academic probation my junior and senior year and still taking classes. The interview is Monday and I'm so embarrassed that I don't even want to show up. He asked me to email my transcript. Getting this degree was the most challenging thing I've done in my life. I had no financial support from my family and had to work full time through college. I just feel like its all excuses. I put six years of my life into this degree and am ashamed of how it turned it. 

I was wondering if anyone else has any success stories or in this situation even with just a lower than average GPA. I don't like to talk about this with anyone because I am ashamed.

4256,gwh0mr,US vs. International PhD structure - pros and cons,"I'm hoping to apply for a Biology PhD in the fall, coming from a US undergraduate background, and would be interested in applying to some international (likely European) programs. Here, it's common for someone with an bachelor's to apply directly to ~5-6 year PhD programs that often include a Master's degree. Internationally, it seems much more common to have separate Master's degree programs (~2 years) and then PhD programs (~3 years). 

While the total time is similar, a big difference seems to be that you have to pay for the Master's degree in the international system, whereas in the US you're typically receiving a PhD stipend throughout the program. One exception I found is the [Max Planck Matter To Life](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/matter-to-life) school, which looks more like US programs. What other programs are like this? 

Also, if anyone has thoughts on the Matter To Life program in particular, I'd be interested in hearing about it!

4262,gwfdl9,"Starting an open-hardware microscope, would love your feedback","With a group of friends we decided to build a microscope in our free time. We are looking for inspiration and ideas to narrow our focus and the specifications of the hardware. Even though we are firm believers of open-hardware/open-science, we also pursue the idea of making the microscope commercially available. Therefore, it would be great to read about how do you use a microscope, what would you do to a microscope if it would be fully hackable? 

Below, the long read:

## Our inspiration
There are many open-hardware microscopes around, such as the [UC2](https://nanoimaging.de/opensource-microscopy/uc2-open-source-optical-toolbox-multi-modal-imaging-incubator/), [MicroscoPy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1) (by IBM), and [OctoPi](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1). However, none of this projects is commercially available, and OctoPi, much to my regret, is just a preprint, it is not open-hardware yet, beyond their claims. Therefore, we want to start a project that is open-hardware, open-source not as an after thought but since the beginning. 

## Our Idea
Microscopes are a tool broadly used, but their true power comes from the techniques built around them. For example, measuring particle sizes through Brownian diffusion, detecting parasites, determining tissue composition through fluorescence, and many, many more. We believe there is room for hackable microscopes, that can be used as a learning or prototyping platform, pretty much in the same sense that Arduino boards are used now a days. 

## Why Commercial 
We don't want to just build a new open-hardware microscope. We would like to build and bring it to the next level, by making it commercially available. In a lot of the open-hardware microscopes, building comes down to sourcing parts from Aliexpress or eBay, with fluctuating qualities and availability. Moreover, sourcing parts on Aliexpress is usually not compatible with how labs process purchases. 

## Our Doubts
Microscopes can have plenty of features and applications. But since we come from the physics world, we are missing plenty. Therefore, we are seeking for ideas regarding what people look for on microscopes. Who uses fluorescence, white-light light transmission, dark-field. What image-processing pipelines do people use. One of the biggest challenges is making it affordable to our pockets. We can't spend 10k on an objective or filters, since it is, for the time being, a side-project, completely bootstrapped. 

## Our ideal roadmap
1.- Start with a simple, white-light microscope, that allows to resolve down to single bacteria. I.e. being able to see yeast in one's kitchen
2.- Find applications, for example using the microscope in an incubator (is this something people care about?), what would be the use of a portable microscope in field work? Perhaps looking at bacteria in water? 
3.- Adding image processing pipelines. Measuring quantities, identifying cells(?)
4.- Launching pre-order campaigns
5.- Secure suppliers, manufacturing, etc. 
6.- Where next? More features? Strengthen current features?",3,2020-06-04 06:08:14,biology

Is Bio the right choice for me?,"I am currently enrolled in community college at the moment and will plan to transfer next year as a third year undergrad into UVA. For months I have been trying to narrow down what major I want to choose.  I’d like to choose sooner rather than later so I can take the best courses that correspond with my desired undergrad degree that I will choose once transferring. I know everyone says to not look at the money and follow your passion, but that’s hard to due especially when you see the pay for what most people make with your passion. At first I was thinking kinesiology. Become an elite level strength coach. Work with pro athletes and division one players. Sounds great, doesn’t it? But bringing myself down to reality, it’s really not likely, and I wouldn’t want to end up being a corporate personal trainer or PT. So my second choice was biology or mechanical engineering. I’ve always liked animals and life sciences as well as building things, but at the same time I’ve always dreaded math classes throughout my academic career. So biology took the lead over engineering. In my head I thought “so why not try to get a bio degree and then maybe try to get into med or vet school?

4279,gwa8hk,Using Crispr on my animals.,"Hi. I am a self-taught bio-hacker. I have been tinkering and learning for the past 5 years now, and I now feel it is time for a ""big"" project.  


By big, I mean modifying my own genome, but before I get to that I want to test this project on my two new baby dogs. If this succeeds I will be the proud owner of two bioluminescent greyhounds!

Thanks to the kits you can get online these days it's dead simple to do this kind of editing, but even better some scientists will help with your projects for a fee, typically over the dark web. One lass I've been in contact with already sells numerous ready-made human therapies. (Increased Muscle Mass, Increased Intelligence, etc)  


I have been using both of these on my three-month-old Davis. I can't wait to report the results, perhaps I can help her win an award, and perhaps have my research published, and hopefully, pave the way for a bio-hacker revolution.

So if that’s the case, are we biologically enslaved to our prejudice?

This seems the case because humans only express prejudice to individuals that they deem different from them.

Genes, as we know, are selfish. Genes want to preserve their own coding at any means possible, including destroying competing genes.

So maybe that’s why things like racism never go away, because humans are always programmed to preserve their own selves and their offspring.",13,2020-06-03 22:56:17,biology

* **A compound called SCH-79797 can damage and destroy cell walls and folate in bacteria.**
* **The team consists of researchers from Princeton University.**
* **The compound can kill both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria without detectable resistance.**
* **The compound targets folate metabolism and membrane integrity which are two different mechanisms within one molecule. Scientists are hoping that this discovery will lead to a better new type of antibiotics.**
* **One of the weaknesses of antibiotics is that bacteria mutates quickly to resist them. The Princeton team found that they were unable to generate any resistance to this compound.**
* **Bacteria divides approximately every 20 minutes and gives them a lot of chances to mutate into an antibiotic resister, but with the compound, they did not. The team also did a similar experiment using other antibiotics and the bacteria quickly mutated with resistance.**
* **An SCH derivative called Irresistin-16 can be used to treat gonorrhea infection in mice.**
* **The team was able to test the compound against the gonorrhea-causing bacteria that is resistant to every known antibiotic and the compound killed the strain.**
* **This research should be significant because antibiotic resistance is on the rise outpacing the discovery of new antibiotics which creates a global health crisis.**
* **Drug regulators has not been approved new antibiotics to treat Gram-negative disease-causing bacteria for almost 30 years.**

4296,gw2amz,Pharmaceutical sales entry-level jobs,"Hi guys,

I'm one of those Biology majors that currently feels lost. I attended college and have just graduated recently with a BS in Biology. Honestly, I applied to colleges deciding to pursue biology because I enjoyed science in high school. Med school did run through my mind early on, but ultimately I decided that I didn't want to go that way. I managed to get a GPA decently above 3, but not anything I would brag about.

Anyway, I've been looking at posts and online forums (like on Reddit) about what to do with a Biology degree. Pharmaceutical sales, QA, etc. have been some options I've seen in order to get into the business side of these corporations, which I was intrigued by. I recently submitted a couple applications and just heard from one company, for the position titled ""Pharmaceutical Sales Rep – Entry Level and Experienced"". Now, of course I read its description and was applying to the Entry Level portion of the application. However, when they responded saying they were beginning an interview process and want to know what would work for me, they stated that I need ""Pharmaceutical sales training"" and ""some sales experience/abilities"". I've never worked in sales, let alone pharmaceutical sales or industries, only some small and part-time customer service jobs. I guess while I've seen that there are some pharmaceutical sales courses online for training, I assumed this would be part of the job if I got hired to the Entry level position. Is there anyone in pharmaceutical sales that can share their journey to getting their position/attest to if this? Is sales experience a necessity? Do I need to either find a company that will hire someone with no experience, or get the training online?

Furthermore, if you guys have any other suggestions or advice for someone in my position I'd greatly appreciate it. I understand the Biology degree is oversaturated and grad-school is an option and ideal in many circumstances, but as of now I am not interested in going that way.

Thanks!",2,2020-06-03 15:47:50,biology

4328,gvsksl,How I created a new rehabilitation method for children with autism!," 

I apologize for all the mistakes, I am from Ukraine and I used a translator

All the links and sources from which I took information and everything I need for development, I will leave, this is not advertising, maybe someone will come in handy.

I must say right away, before that I had never created games and was not involved in programming, I worked as a rehabilitologist for 5 years.

Every day I worked with patients with various disorders, ranging from post-stroke patients with hemiparesis to patients with Korsakov’s syndrome, however, the greatest interest was in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially how their pathology affects their perception of the world, and how they adapted to their characteristics, people were of different ages and with different intellectual abilities.

For 4 years, I performed various physical and cognitive tasks with them, which were aimed at improving their emotional state, developing fine motor skills of hands, reducing stereotyped behavior, improving socialization, imagination, and memory.

According to official figures, in America, every 68 children have ASD, this problem is very relevant and I decided to try to make my contribution and try, at least partially, to help people with ASD. After reading many works on the impact of educational games and video games on people with ASD (if you are interested, here are a few of them [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0018-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0018-5), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0522-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0522-x), [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11623-5\_9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11623-5_9) )   
 

In rehabilitation there are classical methods that have been used for years, these are canons that are generally accepted.  
For example, in the rehabilitation of people with dyslexia always use multisensory **Orton-Gillingham method.**  
**CFMT** is used in the rehabilitation of people with prosopagnosia.  
I was surprised how high their effectiveness is, compared with classic **Segen boards**, **Domanat cards**, **PECS systems,**  **Beasyboards**  and other standard game rehabilitation elements, and such high efficiency of video games and developmental games is shown through the interest of children in the rehabilitation process and their maximum involvement in this process.

The choice was between a video game and a educational game, talking with my patients, their parents and attending a rehabilitation conference in Dresden, where I also had the opportunity to talk with people with ASD - I came to the conclusion that the target audience is more interested in the educational game.

I immediately began to learn more about the features of UI / UX design for people with ASD ( [https://www.designmantic.com/community/designing-for-autistic.php](https://www.designmantic.com/community/designing-for-autistic.php) )

Throughout the development process, I consulted with other specialists, I was greatly helped by occupational therapists and neurologists who also work daily with children with ASD, and in the early stages I was helped by pediatricians, psychologists and physical therapists, I was able to create a multidisciplinary team whose members They helped me a lot with creating the concept of the application and together we were able to come up with the best way for the child to interact with the game. We took into account that the application can be downloaded by people of different age groups, and with a greater / lesser manifestation of specific features of ASD.

I tried to make all levels as comfortable as possible for people with ASD, starting from colors that meet all ADS standards and ending with building levels where I tried to minimize the number of alternative answers that could distract the child.

I tried to make a special emphasis in tasks on the recognition of emotions; in everyday life it is very difficult for people with ASD. I read a lot of literature on this subject, and used the system that Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen developed back in 1978, although FACS was primarily used only for analyzing facial expressions and was used in psychology, it helped me a lot. Also, in problems with the choice of emotions, emphasis was placed on fixing the right choice, by repeated repetition, as practice shows - this approach is very effective and significantly improves memorization.

Most tasks are classic tasks for children with ASD, but are adapted and presented in the form of a game.

During the entire phase of the creation of the game, I consulted with people with ASD, my patients became the first focus group.

The development took about two years, a lot of time was spent reading scientific papers and communicating with people with ASD. Also, a significant part of the time was spent communicating with colleagues who gave their advice and partly took part in the development; it also took a lot of time to draw tasks and find answers to the question about programming in Android Studio.

For more than three months ago, I finished the development of the game, but before publishing, I decided to give it to my patients with ASD so that they could use the application for three months and be able to tell their opinion, and I could evaluate the effectiveness. I also visited all schools for children with special needs that are in the city, and showed the finished application to children with ASD, I asked them to use it for three months, and after three months I returned to talk with them again to evaluate the result.

Some of the children were not able to use the game due to the difficult financial situation and lack of phones, so I gave my previous phones (Samsung Galaxy Gio, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Nokia Lumia 1020) to three children, the models are not new, but the application was installed and you can use them, so I decided to give them to children, I did not use them anyway.

Three months later, the children's parents noted that they and their children were very happy, the children's concentration, memory and emotional state improved significantly, their level of socialization and ability to interpret other people's actions and emotions improved.

Also, many of my acquaintances who have healthy children (without ASD) installed the application, the children liked it very much and the parents noted the improvement of cognitive abilities and memory in children. Therefore, as practice shows, the application can be useful for all children.

Even if the application does not become popular, but can help at least one child - I will be the happiest person in the world!

So can taking niacin help? since it is a major component of NAD and NADP, two coenzymes involved in cellular metabolism.
Niacin also (flush kind) has the ability to dilate the capillaries, surrounding the fatty tissues. When these capillaries are dilated, they can reach the fatty tissue and possibly flush out the toxins which are stored in the fat cells.

Niacin also improves kidneys and liver which are important for cleansing the body.

Being fruit and some veggies at the shortest and meat and fish at its longest. I do understand that there are many factors involved and that probably there is a median time for digesting.

But, under the premise one would eat a single type of food, how does the digestive system know, how long it needs to digest?

There must be a system of recognition to produce the appropriate enzymes and juices to split it. But i was also thinking that there must be some kind of ""check"" system that gives feedback on how much the food has broken down, how much nutriens are left, if it is ready for the next tract, if it has gone bad, and all that.

I found that it is a rather complex system, but i haven't found any information on this question other than: ""nerve endings in the digestive system communicate with the brain to slow down the movement, control the production of juices and release it into the next stage.""

But how?

The above explanation does seem way too simple for me. There must be messenger substances involved, but i didn't find anything about that. Also some sources seemed to be contradicting. Some saying the brain controls it, some saying the brain only let's you know if you need to be eat, drink and use the bathroom, but the digestive process remains internal.

I believe that the body acts highly efficent, so i doubt it randomly splurrs in EVERY enzyme and juice on a go get lucky basis.

Furthermore, depending on the diet but ""a meal"" might contain literally everything: from meat, to fruits, to veggies, to grains. If meat needs way longer than a piece of fruit, will the fruit just be digested first and it remains tag along till the meat is also digested?",1,2020-06-03 05:20:02,biology

I know that slow twitch oxidative fibers are mainly for ""endurance"" and fast twitch muscles are mainly for ""speed, strength and power"", but why do fast twitch muscles have the largest potential for muscle growth? What is the physiological or biochemical reason for this? Is it because of sensitivity to androgens? Or differences in Myostatin content? I am also confused because slow twitch muscles have the most oxygen content and blood supply, so if anything, they should be fiber type that grows the most from resistance training, yet they are not. Why? Why would evolution lead to only fast twitch fibers having the potential for large muscle growth, while slow twitch muscles having only a small potential for growth??",1,2020-06-02 19:24:47,biology

I've taken bio classes before but am being exposed to it a lot more now and one thing I don't get is why are there so many abbreviations, and oftentimes without any consistent rules?

For example, mean arterial pressure is often written as MAP. But, why wouldn't it be written symbolically like &lt;P&gt;\_a or something like that, since &lt;&gt; historically has denoted averages, and subscript a for arterial?

Or another example, cancer often discusses mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), but it seems inconsistent to me that only the ""I"" (i.e. the prefix) in isocitrate survives the abbreviation process whereas both ""D"" (the prefix) and ""H"" (the root) of dehydrogenase are part of the main abbreviation. I'm sure there's some historical component to it, but was just wondering if there are rules? It's really hard to keep track of all of these abbreviations :/

4417,guuric,Why don’t animals get fat and if they do why exactly isn’t it changing their smooth even shape?,"
This idea suddenly popped in my head last night and I couldn’t sleep for an hour wondering about it. So it all started when we ate a very tasty chubby fish earlier. I was thinking this fish looks fat but it’s shape was shape like any other fish of its kind. But you can’t call a fish fat and even if it’s bigger than most of it’s own you will never see a fish that has fat in targeted areas that change its shape. I believe it’s the same for any animal that comes in mind. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an overweight wild animal but I’ve seen fat dogs or cats which still don’t look like they are storing fat in weird ways. So can it be explained how humans get for example side belly fat or arm fat or any fat that changes the initial shape we are born with? Human are animals too so what makes us store fat in uneven ways??? It’s not like animals don’t eat weird unhealthy stuff too or like they do a specific workout🤣Please someone that has any scientific clue about it enlighten me or I’m gonna loose my sleep for a lot more nights trying to research the tiny amount of information that comes up 😅

In other words, it's only something that's made to help with other things (NAD+ regen.)

However, some of the sources I'm reading say that the brain relies on lactate for neurons and prefers lactate over glucose. I thought lactate was only used to help make more energy for muscles, but that it itself is not energy. Is it possible the brain turns glucose into lactate?

4458,gudan9,Dead Whale Found in the Amazon Jungle,"
1. The carcass which is 8-meter long was found near the mouth of the Amazon river last Friday.

2. No wounds has been found anywhere on the body, but there were few clues to explain how this creature ended up so far from the water.

3. Specialist still not sure how it ended there, but we're speculating that the creature was floating too close to the shore and the tide picked it up and slammed it inland into the mangrove.

4. Not only was the whale found remarkably far from shore, it was also found in the exact opposite season you'd expect to see humpbacks in this region.

5.  Looking at the size of the carcass, biologists think the whale is probably a juvenile less than one year old.

6. Biologists suspect that the baby whale somehow lost its mother during migration, and that's why it was left behind in the Amazon basin.

7. Another theory is that the baby whale died from ingesting plastic waste and its dead body was washed ashore during a storm.

About 70% of those deaths are young children and the elderly. It's so sad, their deaths were completely preventable, but they had to die because of a stupid common cold and mucus ridden lungs. RSV is estimated to infect 60 million people worldwide each year, so with the deaths, that's around a 1 percent death rate, which is 10 times higher than the flu.

RIP to everyone who died of RSV this year so far. Not many people know about this deadly common cold. It's even sadder there's no vaccine for this because you're not immune to it once you get it once, twice or 100 times. It basically re infects you until you finally die of pneumonia.

For reference, every two weeks and you will have 40,000 new deaths from RSV as almost 20,000 people die from RSV each week. That is 2700 people dying every single day from just this strain of the common cold alone.",0,2020-05-31 09:09:58,biology

Biology is the study of life. This is a study of the life of different species and how they interact with their environment. Biology recognizes cells as fundamental units of life, genes as inheritance units, and evolution as machines that drive the formation of new species. Learning about life has helped shape the world. It has a credible answer as to why something happened scientifically.

In Class10 Science, biology is one of the important and scoring parts. with [class 10 Biology](https://www.entrancei.com/topics-biology-class-10) Lesson Syllabus, you can learn about life processes, natural resources, environment, control, regulation and reproduction.

It is extremely obvious the mods here have a political agenda and are suppressing this topic. 


I will also state this for the people who are bad readers; SEX =/= GENDER. 

I keep seeing people confusing sex with gender way too much or saying really silly things like they are both made up by people. 

Gender is a biosocial construct, the evidence suggests this. 


However, sex is a biological reality dependent on the reproductive system of each species of life. Some species are asexual, others are monoecious, and others like humans are dioecious. 

Within biology, the sex of dioecious species is dependent on the type of gamete an individual can produce. Some make sperm, we call these males. Some make eggs, we call these females. 


There are individuals who, because of syndromes, developmental disorders, malformations, genetic anomalies, and other atypical conditions, do not clearly fit into these categories.


Within the human species, individuals who do not have any of these medical conditions can be said to be either male or female. Sex is binary in healthy humans, an individual can either naturally make eggs or make sperm.


&gt;""Sex: Either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions. The fact of belonging to one of these categories. The group of all members of either sex.""

So my question is: Is mixing blood types which aren’t fitting agglutinogen of one with agglutinin of another allright? Can it cause some problems in ones future?",6,2020-05-30 15:20:27,biology

4541,gtjq3i,How do topoisomerases deal with the potential energy that comes from supercoiling?,"I learned that topoisomerases cut DNA, let them unwind real quick, then fuse them together to relieve supercoiling tension. However, In my mind when you take a supercoiled rope and cut it, the tension is released as the rope whips around while unwinding. I imagine that such whipping would not be good for the process of DNA replication, maybe even sever the strand? 


One way I can think of to stop the whipping would be to unwind it very slowly, and yet DNA replication is very fast! 

Does the topoisomerase maybe let it whip around, but then manages to ""catch"" it in the end? That runs the risk of the topoisomerase ""missing"" the ""catch"" right? But I've never heard of that before! 


Could it be that molecules and ropes just aren't comparable at all, and when a polymer unwinds it does not experience any whipping because it's mass is so small? 

What's going on here? Life has found a way apparently as DNA replication works, but I can't think of how!",1,2020-05-30 14:04:15,biology

4629,gscsl9,How exactly do masks protect against COVID 19?,"Back in March, most health experts say there was no need for the general public to wear masks. They said you might fiddle with it if you have it on and that a cloth or surgical mask would not protect you from the virus. 

Now its completely opposite, most health experts say you should be wearing one and it could be just a cloth face covering or a surgical mask, doesn't have to be a n95 mask. Governments are starting to mandate them and businesses are as well. 

It is my understanding that each mask has a certain level of protection. A cloth face covering would be the smallest, followed by a surgical mask that is not fool proof because it has holes in the side and the most protective mask would be the n95 mask, which filters out 95% of fine particles and this is the mask doctors and nurses wear when working with covid 19 patients.


One of the basic lessons I learned in biology is that viruses are much much smaller than bacteria, in fact viruses are so small that they cannot be picked up by rays of light and are viewed with an electron microscope. So how exactly with the general public wearing surgical masks and cloth face coverings do wearing these masks protect against the nanometer sized virus?

To better understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective countermeasures against it, antibody-based immunoassays will be essential. 

https://preview.redd.it/g8e9wzovkg151.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bd8bc6cdff11f9f6e9fbdb0fc5353f25504890

As 2019-nCoV and SARS N proteins have 90% homologous similarities, it is allowed that antibodies and antigens to SARS N protein to be used for diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV. Diagnostic testing for the novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV is undertaken with 2 main approaches: genome sequencing and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Sequencing was used primarily in the early days of the outbreak for initial identification of this novel virus and is largely a tool of viral discovery. 

l rRT-PCR: Almost all diagnostic testing for nCoV is done using rRT-PCR. PCR mixes and enzymes are extensively used in fast, sensitive molecular tests. RNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with 2019-nCoV–specific primers and probes. If two targets (open reading frame 1a or 1b, nucleocapsid protein) tested positive by specific real-time RT-PCR, the case would be considered to be laboratory-confirmed. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting. If the repeated Ct-value was less than 40 and an obvious peak was observed, or if the repeated Ct-value was less than 37, the retest was deemed positive. The genome was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from the patient by one of three methods: Sanger sequencing, Illumina sequencing, or nanopore sequencing. Respiratory specimens were inoculated in cells for viral isolation in enhanced biosafety laboratory 3 facilities at the China CDC.

Gene synthesis:   
 As the virus has been identified, most sequencing is being undertaken to further research in order to characterize it and monitor for viral mutation. Advances in gene synthesis mean that subunit vaccines can be developed quickly from one or more antigen-presenting viral genes or peptide sequences, which circumvents the need for scientists to handle live and potentially dangerous pathogens, and eliminates the time needed to clone DNA fragments.",0,2020-05-28 02:32:05,biology

I’ve noticed that every single year when the weather starts to turn hot and humid at the beginning of summer, I always get these headaches. I think I’ve eliminated the possibility that it’s due to dehydration from sweating because I’m especially diligent about drinking lots of water throughout the day when it starts heating up. The pain is centered mostly around my sinuses, behind my eyes, and in the top of my head towards the front so it feels a lot like a sinus headache. I’ve looked for explanations online and found some sources saying that this could be due to changes in barometric pressure that occur with the rising temperature and humidity, and that the discomfort is caused by the difference in pressure of the outside air and the air inside the sinuses. 

So my question is, if it is due to a pressure difference, is there a way to equalize the pressure? Why does the pressure inside the sinuses take so much time to change with the air pressure outside of the body? 

I’ve tried taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen and they somewhat take the edge off the pain, but the pressure and discomfort persist. So I’m just curious what’s going on inside the sinuses that makes it hard to adjust to the pressure.",7,2020-05-27 16:12:16,biology

But then, they made the startling discovery that ancient viruses that took up residence in our DNA millions of years ago may be playing the role of puppet master. I think that we are creatures controlled by viruses and that we would not exist without them. Scientists studying a 3-day old embryo made up of only 8 cells found genetic material from HERV-K ( Human Endogenous Retrovirus-K ), which left its signature on our DNA roughly 200,000 years ago. They found that the cells were full of viral protien products. The virus protein appeared to be preventing other viruses from penetrating the embryo. It's as if retroviruses are competing with each other via their human host, thus protecting the embryo from threats like flu and may be COVID-19 today. So, an ancient virus that once harmed us now helps unborn children fight off newer foes. I have seen this in several instances that a COVID-19 infected mother gave birth to a healthy baby. Maybe, this is the reason. Long before this, it was known that a virus gene is needed for the formation of placenta. A viral protein called 'syncitin' is made only by those placental cells that touch the uterus. Using Syncitin, the cells fuse together to form a layer that draws nutrients for the foetus from the mother. Originally, syncitin allowed viruses to fuse host cells together so they could spread from one cell to another. Now, the protein allowed babies to fuse to their mother. To find out how important syncitin is during gestation, scientists turned off the gene that makes it in mice embryos. All of embroyos died after 11 days. Genes borrowed from viruses give cells the ability to grow into tissues and organs. Without these, animal life may have remained limited to blobs of cells. I know it's difficult to believe.

Mould is most resistant because it consists of long, branching filaments which UV may find hard to penetrate.

UV light finds it harder to penetrate gram positive’s thick cell wall compared to gram negative’s thin cell wall.

Spores are resistant to UV light

In this publication [Consistent Associations between Body Size and Hidden Contrasting Color Signals across a Range of Insect Tax](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/703535) , under the methods section, subsection phylogenetic analysis, they claim they are testing two models assuming Brownian motion (BM) or Orstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) character evolution. In Table 1 they go on to present a column with Pagel's λ.

I've read Pagel's 1999 paper [here](https://www-nature-com.proxy.library.carleton.ca/articles/44766), and 2002 paper [here](https://courses.helsinki.fi/sites/default/files/course-material/4523939/Freckleton02.pdf), which seem to cover Pagel's method fairly well, but I am very new to this area of research, so I may have missed something. After reading Pagel's papers (and several papers about the method or which have utilized the method) I have two issues with the first mentioned publication -- or certainly at least, I have two misunderstandings. There are two professors attached to this article, and it had to go through the peer-review process, so I am operating on the principle of charity.

**1) How is Pagel's Lambda an OU model? I can't even find the term in the 1999 or 2002 publications.**

When λ=1, I understand that this is equivalent to a BM model of character evolution. When λ=0, the data is independent from phylogeny; closely related species are as similar to each other as they might be to distantly related species. The only case I see for calling it an OU model, is when λ&gt;1, in which case species look more similar than expected from their phylogenetic relationships -- which sounds like friction towards some optimum.

But, I am not conviced that λ&gt;1 is necessarily an OU model, but rather describes an underlying OU like process of evolution. Even so, only one of their λ values (1 out of 5) exceeded 1, at 1.06. And they then go on to say:

&gt;We therefore present the results of assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of character evolution

**2) This paper compares only two models: an estimate of** **λ and BM. Should you not always test against the null hypothesis of** **λ=0, or is it simply assumed there is always** ***some*** **amount of phylogenetic signal due to shared history of species in a phylogeny i.e. their non-independence?**

In Pagel's papers and many papers which employ Pagel's method, they recommend testing against λ=0 or report that they did. This one does not.

4747,gqy37o,My research on SARS-COV 2,"Hello. This whole message will contain research I’ve been working on since March. I’m a high school student and therefore don’t have any credentials to publish my work seriously. So I’ve opted to just make it public for use by any means I can. 

The Research:
It’s purpose is to find a cure and vaccine against COVID-19( I ended up finding a potential therapy and means to attenuate the virus ). 

The therapy:
It would include:
•1g(preferably in 4ml of water) of antibodies against the virus 
•0.5g(2ml) of antibodies against IL6
•0.5g(2ml) of antibodies against IL12

Reasoning:
1 The 1g of antibodies against virus

The plan was to aid in opsonisation of the virions. To do this I first tried looking at the viral load in conjunction with the number of spike proteins on each virion. However it was hard to make out how many spikes were present per virion. So instead I decided to look at the problems caused by the antibodies and try to avoid them. The only problem I came across was that the antibodies exert an osmotic pressure of (estimated) 50kPa(350mm Hg) when 250g of antibodies are present in 1L of water. Therefore 1g in 4ml would exert a pressure of 1.5mm Hg  I then needed to get the number of antibodies in 1g to see how it would fair against one of the recorded viral loads(Fatal incident) . So the estimated mass of one antibody is 150kDa and 1g in daltons is 6.022*10^23Da. Meaning in 1g 4.015*10^18 antibodies are present. The recorded viral load from the patient’s sputum samples peaked at 1.34*10^11 virion copies per ml. So assuming they had 5L worth of virions, making them 6.7*10^14 virion copies, 1g is enough to allocate 5993 antibodies per virion. This seems like enough when considering the micrographs. And since the 1g is dispersed within 5L its osmotic pressure reduces to 0.0012 mm Hg. Which is pretty much negligible because the plasma colloidal pressure within each capillary is estimated at 25mm Hg. This is why I settled on one gram. 

2 0.5g of antibodies against IL6

This is to deal with the cytokine storm of IL6 that the virus stimulates. The mass is based off of the idea that assuming half of all the virions produced stimulated production of IL6, there would be enough antibodies to coat 5993 copies. 

3 0.5g of antibodies against IL12. 

I read a compelling argument that IL12 is responsible for the leaking of fluid into the alveolar space. The idea is that differentiated helper T cells are responsible for secreting pro inflammatory chemokines which affect the permeability of the alveolar walls allowing fluid containing immune cells to flow into the alveolar space. So this adaptive immune response seems to be headed by TH1 cells. And I had read somewhere else that TH1 cell differentiation cannot occur in the absence of IL12. So preventing IL12 from functioning could help prevent this leaking into the alveoli. The mass is based on the same concept explained above(for IL6 antibodies). 



The means of attenuating the virus:

I speculate that passing isolated virions through restricted Phosphatase enzyme would break down the envelope of the virus and separate the spike proteins from the viral RNA. The idea is that the inner and outer layers of the envelope have hydrophilic phosphate heads which create a balance of inward and outward pulls. So if we cleave the outer phosphate heads and leave a lower charge hydroxyl group the imbalance of forces would lead to the envelope collapsing inward and possibly breaking apart. 
The virions can be isolated using plasma membrane filtration. 

Use:
This can be used to develop a vaccine. It could also be used to produce antibodies through the hybridoma method which could allow for mass production. 


So that’s basically my research. Hopefully it’s helpful. Stay safe.",8,2020-05-26 09:30:21,biology

In my backyard I have a loquat tree and when I harvested the fruit I saved all the seeds!

And man have they all grown different! The ones that were in soil got knocked over and washed out of the pots during a storm so I could see how they're growing. They have 1 thick root going straight down. Pretty typical I believe for plants outside. The ones in paper towels have tons of roots! But theyre all very thin. They have roots clinging onto other seeds and through the paper towel. And the ones in sphagnum moss are very similar, lots of skinny roots. And some of the ones in moss seem to maybe have a bit of a shoot? I'm not sure yet!

Ok, so maybe this seems like a silly question, but please hear me out:

I'm  writing an essay on visual receptors in insects, and it occurs to me  that it's very difficult to define vision/sight in any way that's both  accurate and exact.

Oxford Dictionary of Biology defines **vision** as: *the sense that enables perception of objects by means of the eyes, b*ut goes on to define **eyes** as: *the organ of sight* (there's no entry for **sight** but we can see it as a synonym for vision.)

Outside of biological texts, it's the same circular logic. The concept of ""sight"" is implicit in our language- but should it be?

My question to you is, **how- as a biologist (or similar), would you define vision?**

Points to consider:

* We can reject the ""perception of objects"" definition pretty easily. The ocellus is **definitely**  an organ of vision as they are crucial to an insect's visual navigation  and proprioception and often supersede the compound eyes in this role.  Sure, in Odonata and desert ants it's been shown to have higher levels  of resolution, but in Dipterans they're really just saying ""How bright is this?"", ""How bright is this  compared to a moment ago?"", and ""How bright is this compared to my other  ocelli?"". Perhaps you could count ""the sky"" and ""not the sky"" as  objects, but that's pretty dodgy reasoning as they'll exhibit identical  responses to any other light stimulus you shine at them.
* The  first definition that occurred to me is that sight is ""Synthesis of  information contained in light radiation""). But human skin contains  opsins which, in response to light information (intensity), produce a  consistent response (tanning). Every single kingdom of life shows  responses to light stimulus. Cockroaches have light receptors directly  incorporated into their brains, which entrain their circadian clocks.  Almost all plants exhibit phototaxis. So this first definition would  include all of those things as **vision**.
* Another thought which occurred to me is that things like skin tanning and phototaxis could be excluded by defining vision as ""**Neurally mediated** synthesis of information contained in light radiation"". But cockroaches and other insects have circadian light receptors **directly incorporated into their brains**, so that won't work either. (Besides which, the human blue-light response is also neurally mediated- is *that* vision?)

Anyway,  what are your thoughts? I'm already writing an essay on similar things,  so don't worry about writing such a high-effort response, I just want  to hear what other people think about this- is my reasoning off? Can you  come up with another testable definition for any of this?

Anyways,  thanks for reading this far- I really want to hear what you have to say on this subject.

Let me know if you're interested in any of my sources!

4822,gq3v0x,Thoughts on the erosion of industry science careers,"Hi all, I know there are a lot of biologists on this subreddit and I wanted to know your thoughts on something that has been bugging me. 

Before starting my undergrad, my goal was to get a degree(s) and then go into “industry science”, never academia (management and teaching are not my strong suit). Honestly, signing up for consensual exploitation working 50 hour weeks at minimum wage with no overtime in grad school sounds awful. The light at the end of the tunnel being the potential to “win” the lottery and get to become an overworked underpaid assistant prof for most of my life sounds like an awfully shit prize for all that hard work. 

All throughout my degree, I heard profs and grad students talking about “industry” being an alternative to the traditional academia career path. This appealed to me. Once I finished a BSc biology degree, I was job hunting for about 14 months due to the shitty job market and my desire to find a position that wasn’t just assembly-line sample processing or medical device telemarketing. During this time, I looked at job postings all across my country (Canada) and there were maybe 2-3 decent scientific jobs (ie project-based experimental work that actually uses your brain) per month in places like Toronto. In a population center of 4 million, a handful of jobs is more of a niche hobby than an industry, imho. 

The whole time I job searched, I felt like “industry science” was hidden behind a curtain like some secret VIP room. Recently with all this time to reflect during quarantine, I think I’ve figured out where these industry jobs went - they actually haven’t existed for years! Instead of hiring a scientist to work for a company/startup and incurring all the costs of a full time salary, benefits, basic scientific equipment costs to outfit a lab, etc., it is much cheaper for companies looking to develop a biological concept/product/process to just collaborate with (i.e. pay) an academic lab and get the cheap labour of grad students to do that work instead. It’s essentially outsourcing for science. 

Obviously some exceptions include big pharmaceutical companies and some startups clustered around major Ivy League unis, but my overall impression was that biology as an industry has no job market to speak of. Is this true? Am I missing something? Any input is appreciated bc I’m reconsidering my whole career path while stuck in the house right now.",18,2020-05-24 22:51:03,biology

I do know that when it comes to sports, what plays a huge part in the success of an athlete is genetics, as you need to have certain genes (plus practice and proper fundamentals) to succeed in a sport. I did post a question like this on r/Basketball and r/trackandfield, and I did find one comment that also talked about how genetics plays a role in intelligence as well. So my question to you is, is intelligence inherited, or can it be taught? Do the great minds and creators, such as Albert Einstein, have genes that make them more smarter than the average person?

Apparently, scanning for ctDNA has been difficult in the past because there is so many cfDNA in your blood and it’s hard to seperate cfDNA from ctDNA. In this article they talked about scanning the DNA from white blood cells as well, and using the mutations found in the white blood cells as some sort of filter, so that you’re only left with the mutations that are probably from the tumor. Using this white blood cell filter greatly increased accuracy in predicting survival chances for patients. 

I get the mechanism on how they’re “filtering” through all the mutations so they’re left with almost certainly ctDNA. I just don’t understand why white blood cells have so many mutations that the mutations in white blood cells can otherwise be mistaken for ctDNA. 

So, where do all these mutations come from? Do we all have so many mutations in our white blood cells or is it only in patients with a certain type of cancer?",1,2020-05-24 16:30:07,biology

I was pretty anti-social at school and I suck at networking.

My initial goal was pharmacy school and I have taken the PCAT a few times (my highest composite score was an 86 but my essay score is a 2) and I've applied for UofT PharmD before and got rejected (likely because of low essay score). I've basically given up on this since I've heard how horrible it was from a friend that got into the program. Considering how saturated the job market is, I don't think it is a good option anyway.

Now I just feel like I've walked myself into a dead end and I really don't know what to do.

These  estimates  could  change  for  different  populations  andenvironments,  as  heritabilities  vary  depending  on  the  population  andenvironment  being  studied.

Her thought was that the number of vitamins in a single sprout is the same as in an adult plant, so the gram for gram ratio goes down a lot when the plant grows due to the fibre and water content increasing. My thought was that although the plant gets bigger, it also is producing a lot more new cells which need to be maintained so the over all ratio would not change much. So what is actually happening and which case is closer to the truth?

These were exposed to UV light in a concentrated small space, with reflective walls, for 0 minutes (control) 5 and 10 minutes (labeled orange course) and are currently in incubation.

4941,gomeek,Question about genetics and the like as an asfrct to facial attractiveness,"I have a theory that attractiveness isn't genetic and would like to see if it makes sense and if it's wrong could you find the flaws in it?

OK so basically when we are born all babies faces look the same. That's becuase they've given through about the same diet as each other for the past 9 months

However when they grow up they look totally different .

Now slafter thinking how do genetics change face so did some research and apparently geenetics  control phenotype, nose length, eye color.

So why do faces look different?

After some research I think it may be down to hormones. For example in the animal world all animals look increbidly similar and its down to their style of life and the like.

So what o belive is modern man isn't eating properly anymore. We don't eat enough meats, we don't eat organically we eat processed food.

And in turn I think this has had detrimental affects on (in the case of men) HGH and Testosterone.

For example we know that HGH actually makes craniofacial development happen, height growth, grams growth, strength growth and we know its affected by our environment and the smae for Testosterone. It can be boosted by living a healthy life and exercising.

So we know hormones affect how attractive someone is according to science but is it true? Like we can't find genes for assynetrues or recfesion or for malocclusion which it seems looks may be environmental.

And that would make sense shkwi g to potential mates how healthy you are as if it was genetic since the day you were brain you would never have a mate as your genetics are low quality

While in animals we know attractiveness to other mates is a sign of health and thus fertility and is seen as better.

Would it be the same in humans or is facial attractiveness fully Controlled by genetics and genetuc recombination?",2,2020-05-22 11:21:49,biology

4987,go9kno,Question regarding expression of multi-subunit protein complexes,"Hello all!

I was doing some literature research (going to keep it vague unless further detail is needed). I am looking at if there are examples of certain protein complexes known to retain their function even without one or more of the usual subunits. For example, say most bacteria have complex protABC that does function X. I am looking for species that only have part of that complex, for example protAB, but can still do function X.

I read one study that found that a certain microbial group contributed a large amount to expression of only ONE subunit of a two-subunit complex, and there was no detectable expression of the other subunit. This contrasts with other papers regarding this protein complex which seem to always refer to the two subunits together, implying there are no known cases of them functioning on their own.

Would this alone be enough to validate a claim that this microbial group does not express/need that subunit, at least in the environmental conditions from which it was sampled? Or, are there likely other factors that could be in play that I am not thinking of that would make that claim invalid? Basically, could I put this microbial group down as an example that does not need/use the second subunit?

The paper was published two years ago and I have not found any follow-ups regarding the part I am interested in. The authors also did not make any claims about the subunits, they just included a table that showed no expression of the one subunit from this microbial group.

Hopefully this makes sense. Thank you in advance for any responses!",2,2020-05-21 20:08:38,biology

5015,gnwm8s,Complement System,"Hello, I have questions regarding the complement system. 

1. Since complement proteins (like C1q, ficolin, MBL) recognize features on microbial surfaces, how do commensal organisms stay and not get eliminated by immune cells? 
2. Using complement regulatory proteins, the C3 convertase gets converted into iC3b. I understand that this is accomplished in healthy normal cells where the regulators are present (like Factor I, H, DAP, MCP) to avoid auto-immunity. Why are there complement receptors (CRs) for iC3b then? These receptors can stimulate phagocytosis and other effector functions. If the purpose of regulation is to avoid auto-immunity by inactivated C3b, why are there receptors which recognize iC3b and carry on downstream effects? In fact, I have read that CR2 specifically detects C3dg (product of further iC3b cleavage) to elicit a strong antibody response. 
3. How do people with C3 deficiency survive?
4. Janeway mentions that the C6 to C9 proteins which form the MAC have limited functions (ie. limited by killing only  a few pathogens). Why, then, did our body allow the evolution of these additional proteins? Wouldn't it be more energetically favorable to have had other innate/adaptive functions be refined and expanded to do what C6-C9 proteins do? 

Please note that my knowledge of immunology is introductory and broad. I am reviewing again and am in the Chapter 2 of Janeway's immunobiology book.

I am Lorenzo, 22. I am currently studying Applied Biology at HAS University in the Netherlands and I am looking for an internship. I am originally from the Caribbean and I love the tropics (worldwide). So now I am searching for an internship in the tropics that fits the criteria provided by my university. 

In the Netherlands, places that provide quality internships are usually universities, commercial companies or private companies that focus on improving the agricultural sector. In my case everything that has to do with plants, ecology, animals and (growing) food. What we as students must do during an internship is to write a scientific report about a project or experiment that we conduct during our stay. Topics that interest me are; 

1. Improving crops by means of selection and genetic markers (e.g. seed breeding)

2. Discovering ways to a more sustainable form of farming (e.g. indoor farms, biological control) 

3. Finding ways to preserve precious ecosystems (e.g. the rainforest) and maintain (endangered) animal populations in the wild

4. Marine Biology and the preservation of marine life and ecosystems (e.g. coral reefs)

5. I am open to various other fields in biology which may not have crossed my mind or are still unknown to me!

If you know a place, company, university or family business that might be suitable and is open to receive interns, or maybe you have a contact in the tropics that could help me find one, I would love to hear from you!

Thank you for taking the time to read this

5120,gmrlvj,Am I reading this lead study right?,"I recently started on a project and began learning
about lead and its impact, and this ATSDR study has been very useful but I'm not sure I'm drawing the right conclusions from parts of this study, specifically the ""Biological Fate"" portion. 

 [Link](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=34&amp;po=9)


 
It says: 


""The absorption and biological fate of lead once it enters the human body depends on a variety of factors.
The blood carries only a small fraction of total lead body burden, and serves as the initial receptacle of absorbed lead, distributing it throughout the body, making it available to other tissues.

Absorbed lead that is not excreted is exchanged primarily among three compartments: 

Blood

Mineralizing tissues (bones and teeth), which typically contain the vast majority of the lead body burden, and

Soft tissue (liver, kidneys, lungs, brain, spleen, muscles, and heart

Once in the bloodstream, lead is primarily distributed among three compartments - blood, mineralizing tissue, and soft tissues. The bones and teeth of adults contain more than 95% of total lead in the body."" 

Does that mean 95% of the absorbed lead go from the blood straight to the bones and teeth or does the lead make way to other organs and eventually make its way to the teeth and bones? 






""Adults typically absorb up to 20% of ingested inorganic lead after a meal and up to 60-80% on an empty stomach [ATSDR 2010]."" 

Does this apply to any amount of lead, even small amounts? Hypothetically, say I ingest a lot lead like 1/4 of 1  gram, anywhere from 20% to 60% of that would be absorbed. But if I ingest a small amount, say 2 micrograms, would none of it get absorbed or would 20% to 60% of 2 micrograms get absorbed?






""Most of the lead that enters the body is excreted in urine or through biliary clearance (ultimately, in the feces)."" 

Hypothetically let's say I ingest or inhale only a little every day. Would I excrete most of it and basically start over at ""0"" the next day or would it add up?",0,2020-05-19 11:13:58,biology

I currently am a research assistant in a neurology lab with a BS in genetics and a minor in microbiology. During college, I was a teaching assistant for three labs and a database curator. I plan to go back for a PhD or masters but am now wondering in what. Previously, I wanted to focus on microbiology and infectious disease, working on the genes in hosts that affect mircobial adherence and infectivity. 

Now, what PhD or masters program should I go for? I'm thinking bioinformatics as I have experience. What are some remote positions that I could do?

The videos are very watchable for the layman, even when he deals with complex biological functions. He designed the course as such, so that any students can take it without a foundation in biology. (In the first class he even addresses a graduate student of literature, there to learn about behavior!)  

I'm nearing the end of the series and looking for recommendations of something similar, not by subject necessarily, but something to listen to with voice, passion, and personality.

5206,glvmit,How are naive CD8+ Cytotoxic T cells activated?,"I just wanted to ask how naive CTLs are activated in the event of either a virus infection or tumour cell growth.

My understanding is that APCs internalise the endogenous antigen, migrate to the lymph nodes and present it to CTLs via MHC I. This process requires co-stimulation.  Activated CTLs then travel to the site, and recognise and kill transformed cells via MHC I-CD8+ interaction. This process does not require co-stimulation as normal cells do not express co-stimulatory molecules.

Are naive CTLs only activated in the lymph nodes? Are there circulating naive CTLs which directly recognise transformed cells? Im assuming not, since that would imply CTLs can respond as fast as the innate immunity.

Are there any differences in CTL activation in virus vs tumour cells?",3,2020-05-18 00:49:52,biology

I am currently going through Prof. Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology lectures on youtube: 
[Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&amp;feature=share)

I'm finding it very informative. But at the same time I have some doubts, so I was wondering if there's a forum for the same. It'll be great if you can share any discussion forum where I can post the doubts.

One particular doubt I have is based on the 3rd lecture, where he talks about infanticide in species other than humans. What I was wondering, is that if a female is already pregnant or nursing a baby, and then some male (not the father) comes along and kills the baby and impregnates the female with his sperm and leaves to impregnate other females. How does this system sustain itself, since now other male can come and kill the baby and this cycle just keeps going. Where does this cycle end?

I understand the converse law of size and mass, and I'm trying not to make anything too outrageous,  

The planet with life on it is going to orbit Aldebaran, a Red Giant system in the Taurus star cluster. 

The planet is going to be a rocky planet roughly the same mass as Jupiter. 

I'm still working out the thermal dynamics of that orbit and other stuff, but I'll take that to the astronomy guys.

My question is about life on that planet itself and basic biorhythms.

So, here's the data I have: 

The planet's rotation is one year of theirs is 3600 years. 

Gravity is 7x that of earth.

The orbit takes it close to the host star, and then deep into space, so due to its size, and density, there's high volcanic activity, and the planet is warmed through geothermal energy during the ""Cold months"" 

The humanoid aliens living there would be about 16' tall, the basic body would be scaled up a humanoid shape, and similar organ structure. I calculated one would weigh about 1500lbs. 

I do understand that earth biology scaled up and tossed onto that planet would be absolutely pancaking and instant death, but if the evolutionary soup had evolved on that hell world, I would take into account that the biology may use different materials (add titanium to their bone structure or something) that would allow the heavy greenhouse gasses and high carbon content to create a thick jungle planet resembling the late Jurassic with the megafauna.

What I'm trying to work out is how long of a lifespan one of those people would have? if we were to match all the basic biological processes, but... slow it down(?) to account for a 3600-year orbital period.

I had thought a typical ruler would stay seated for 20 to 50 of their years, or 72,000 to 180,000 of our years. After all, time is relative, right? But, I really don't want readers to think my calculations are crazy, or that the alien race I'm building is purely unfounded. 

I vaguely remember watching a documentary about the circadian rhythm and how when you scale up and gravity is involved, things slow down and do live longer... but I could be remembering falsely.

&amp;#x200B;

a. molecular size and charge of the fragments

b. color of fragments

c. charge on the fragments

d. size of the fragments

&amp;#x200B;

I got it wrong. I think it's not a well written question in the first place. After initially marking ""molecular size and charge of the fragments"", I switched it to ""charge on the fragments"" and got it wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I know DNA movement through the gel is determined by the charge as well as the size of fragments (smaller fragments move farther).

&amp;#x200B;

But the key word is ""causes""...what causes it (movement)? Different sizes of fragments don't \*cause\* them to move. Size merely facilitates how far the movement will be. You could have fragments that just size there because nothing (no charge) is causing them to move. Charges \*cause\* them to move because an opposite charge is set up on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have a point?

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

I think my point is made even stronger because the question immediately following the first question was:

&amp;#x200B;

""What would cause one DNA sample to travel further than another?

a. smaller size

b. stronger charge

c. larger size

d. weaker charge""

And I put ""smaller size"". It was right, as it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the second question was put there to clarify the first question.

I got it wrong. I know it's Euglena, which has a flagellum. An Euglena is a Protist. Euglena was one of the answers, so I should've marked that. I honestly thought I did but apparently I didn't. I'm okay getting this marked wrong. Overall in my opinion Protist should've been taken off as one of the answer choices.

I graduated last year with a BS in Digital Art Engineering so I basically make visual effects and software tools for artists.

In fact when I was in school I had a really hard time choosing whether I wanted to go down that route or the route I took instead. Now I feel like I've made a mistake.   
  
Anyway, the fields I'm most interested in are wildlife biology, zoology and microbiology. I was thinking about attending CSU Humboldt for biology. I don't know anyone in this field so I feel like I'm going in a little blind. I know Humboldt also has many different degrees within biology so that's why I was leaning towards there, although it would require me to move. I'm actually quite close to UCLA so I might apply there as well. I know I would be required to get more than just a BS. Any advice would be wholly welcome here. What is the usual progression through one of these careers? I love these subjects and want to contribute and make a difference, but I'm not very familiar with the actual jobs. I would love to be able to work outside sometimes, but also wouldn't want to have to move around too much. So would you recommend pursuing one of these fields?

So first, the original joke:  A man tears his pants, goes to a Greek tailor.  The tailor looks at them and asks, ""Euripides?""  The man replies, ""Yep.  Eumenides?"" 

So here's the (possible) biological humor.  *Eumenidae* is the name given to the potter wasps by taxonomists who consider the group to be a family; those who consider it a subfamily classify them as *Eumeninae*. Wikipedia says the name derives from a Greek General, [Eumenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes)., who started his career as secretary to Philip II, and after his assassination, to his son Alexander.

However, somewhere I read or heard that the group derives its name from the [Eumenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes), the 'Kindly Ones', which was a euphemism for the Furies, women who hunt you down and torment you your whole life.  So it's a funny allusion.  (BTW, the Furies also spring from the blood of Uranus's genitals, after Cronus, his own son, cuts them off and throws them into the sea.  What delightful story-tellers the ancient Greeks were.)

There are problems, however, with both explanations.  I can find no reason why the wasps would be associated with that particularly general.

On the other hand, I do not believe that potter wasps swarm, and they rarely sting.  So that isn't a satisfactory explanation, either.

5327,gkhu4b,"Debating Getting a Masters in Cell &amp; Molecular Biology, Yes or No?","Hi r/biology, 

I graduated in 2017 from a small liberal arts school with a B.A. in Molecular Biology. Top notch grades.

I tried doing research with a PI but after one year could not stand it (mostly couldn't stand the PI).

When I graduated, unsure of what to do to make money, I worked in retail, and I have since. I also had some mental health issues that landed me in the hospital a couple times, so there's that. Needless to say, even though I live near Boston, I had no luck with entry level research assistant/tech postings, but I didn't pursue those too much since I was a bit disheartened.

Now, I'm feeling like I could give research another try, and want to go for a Master's degree in Cell &amp; Molecular biology. I mustered up references etc. and got accepted, but I would be going like 30-40k into debt after paying off my undergrad already.

I'm taking a gamble that my more mature self will find research more approachable, and also I don't know if I'm going for job training in industry or research in academia or what. On the other hand, I got into a really great program.

tl;dr Wondering if a Masters in mol bio is wise if I'm going back into debt and I'm not 100% sure.",8,2020-05-15 16:23:39,biology

The lecturer explains that there is a positive correlation between the number of divisions a fibroblast can perform and the lifespan of the animal from which the fibroblast is derived. 

[Lecturer did not mention the source :\(](https://preview.redd.it/lgp16nsp1oy41.png?width=935&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d0eb085e07136bbeeed1c047ce2a9ff4f3589f3a)

Why is it that animals which have a greater capacity for cellular division (larger hay flick limit) age slower?

Contrarily, why is it that individuals with progeric conditions such as Werner's syndromes, who have a lower hayflick limit, age faster?

I'm trying to find information/contacts on where to propose this to a University to do a run-through test and study. I know I can just 'email a University', but I'm hoping to rather get in contact, and make sure it's seen.

Reasoning:

Gyms are opening around the country, albeit slowly. As far as how this can only fuel the spread of this virus, as most aren’t requiring you to wear a mask, this can only hurt.

Proposal idea:

I would only recommend this to be done in a controlled environment, with experts leading the case. For safety, legal, etc.

My idea is to show a gym floor, with a minimum of 50 guests inside, after, say, 30 minutes of exercise. Heavy breathing needs to be attained. Then, flip off the lights, turn on the UV. Thermal imager tuned for moisture. Spitballing here, as I’m not accustomed to how this would need to be done: but a thermal imager, maybe a fogger? If the indoor temp is around 60 (most gyms) it would show rather well, especially the drift, in my opinion; but again, not the expert here. Maybe even one of the FLIR Gas Detection Cameras, for the exhaled CO2.

Fluorescent paint added to the hands too, to show where everyone is touching and spreading.

This study helped me think of a few items:

Let's say we have a drug that could arrest all cells in the body in G0 reversibly. If we administered such a drug, we would stop telomere erosion entirely, but we would also halt division forever, which is much more detrimental. What if we administered said drug, let's say, three days out of four, and then removed the drug on the fourth day and let cells divide and regenerate damaged tissue. Would that not extend telomere lifetimes by a factor of four?

A related question, what kind of detrimental effects would be observed if the cell cycle is systemically halted repeatedly for days at a time? I assume nothing good, but would the damage be manageable, especially given the periods where the cell cycle is active? Would this actually theoretically be a useful life extension method?

I'm currently working with a multinucleated filamentous fungus on my Master's.

This fungus has some proven biotechnological potential for production of oils, vitamins, flavours, ...

However, gene expression is performed with only weak/strong constitutive promoters and there's none that is inducible by chemical compounds (i.e. IPTG to induce gene expression in bacteria).

Said that, I'd like to contribute to the research group by developing a system that would allow them to induce the expression of a given gene at sometime during growth.

Does anyone has any idea on how can I achieve that?

5514,gify80,Switching from Biochem to bio?,"TL;DR at end since this is a rant question.

So I am a biochem major right now, if I take summer classes and take a lot of credits in the fall and spring I can graduate May 2021 (so total I've been in college 4 years, and would graduate yr 5). My friend noticed I have been struggling with classes and made a comment about how the classes will only get harder from here. In Fall 2020 I'm taking biochem, Achem, amd Pchem all at once and some electives so it'll be difficult. I am really passionate about biology, but chose biochem originally since I thought it would be a better job market and I could find a good paying, stable career. But I'm not passionate about chemistry like I am about biology, I love animals and would love to work with animals. I have an appointment with my advisor asking if it would be wise if I switch to biology. Would I be able to find a career that I could work with animals, is a stable job, and I could make enough money that going through college was worth it? I want a career I can thrive day to day instead of survive. I don't know what options are available to me though, if I do switch to just biology or something similar. I guess I'm asking what is your guy's experience with academia and finding a biology career. Maybe something like animal rehabilitation or conservation that I have to do field work in. I have a lot of lab experience and work in a lab (not getting hours since Covid, research is shutdown), so maybe that experience will be handy. Does anyone have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it.

5591,ghop6x,Would a Virus disassemble if we could force it to be matter waves with destructive interference of the wave that is causing it to be physical?,"We would need to know its resonant frequency so we don’t harm healthy cells. The wave causing physicality is around 0.3 micrometers in wavelength. It is on the EM spectrum, but I don’t know if we can cause destructive interference without the aid of a black hole. That is where the decoherence wave is coming from. This would be the biggest breakthrough in science ..ever.

Perhaps a coherent ultraviolet wave would do the trick. It would need set to the exact wavelength of the quantum/classical boundary. We know viruses are on the upper edge of this boundary because they do not display fringes in the double slit experiment. Viruses are a little larger than 0.3 micrometers. It takes light a femtosecond to cross this distance, so we are close to the frequency and wavelength necessary to cancel the decoherence wave out. If coherent waves don’t do it, we may need to figure out how to redirect other decoherence waves at the virus.",31,2020-05-11 09:36:03,biology

It contains a rather prescient statement:

**""potential alterations in furin localization or activity can be a major threat to pubic health""**

&amp;#x200B;

So - conjoin this study with the earlier one.

The way I see it -

\[1\]   May 2007 - The scientific community published analysis of the 4 COVID19 S protein RBDs and their comparative binding efficacy and immunological profile (and most importantly - combinatory effects) *before* the combinations were found (together) in nature. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314167](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17314167)

\[2\]  Nov. 2014 - The scientific community suspected furin had binding-site potential and that alterations to it in Bat CoVs could cause pandemic, 4-5 years before any such alterations were observed in nature.  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338073/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4338073/)

&amp;#x200B;

And 2 more thoughts:

\[1\]  Re: the Malayan pangolins as a ""host reservoir"" theory:  The malayan pangolins in the Wildlife Refuge all died, rather horribly, most within 1.5 months.  Hosts that suffer horribly and die shortly after infection - are not ""good (*natural*) hosts"".  That's an exceedingly weak theory.

\[2\]  Much has been made of the 2 ""gains-of-function"" of COVID19.  But there may also have losses of function, including the range of infectable hosts.  Equal focus should be applied to that side of the equation for a proper forensic analysis, imho.",11,2020-05-10 14:19:17,biology

5680,ggpmtx,Clarification on some immunology,"Hey guys. I am new to the subreddit and I'm assuming there are some *really* smart biology people here and I was wondering if I could get some help.

So, I have 2 inquiries:

1. MHC Class 1 can be made by all nucleated cells within the body, where the cells form the complex with a protein + peptide of a foreign/unusual material? And MHC Class 2 can be made only by APCs, who can phagocytose foreign material, chop it up inside, then present it to helper T cells? (i.e. Class 1: Inside -&gt; Outside / Class 2: Outside -&gt; Inside -&gt; Outside)
2. Both helper and cytotoxic T cells have TCRs that are used to bind to the MHC molecules, which can be **thought of** as like membrane bound antibodies on B cells but are actually different. But its the CD4+ and CD8+ proteins on them that causes each to go to MHC Class 2 and 1 respectively, is that correct?

Please I really want to know this. I'm currently studying high school biology and they don't go in-depth into it because it is 'too much information you won't be tested on it don't worry' but i dont give a shit i wanna learn. Thank you 😊",8,2020-05-09 17:55:07,biology

I've been asked to come up with a list of protocols for co-extraction of DNA and RNA for genome and transcriptome sequencing. There's some catches:

* High molecular weight (HMW) DNA necessary for PacBio sequencing
* Tiny sample sizes (whole organisms may be &lt;2mg)
* Samples will almost certainly be flash frozen and kept at -70C prior to extraction

HMW DNA makes homogenisation interesting, but I've some experience with hand-grinding in lysis buffer or liquid nitrogen and getting good quality HMW DNA using a couple of methods. 

My first thought for co-extraction is a phenol-chloroform protocol (TRIzol/Tri-reagent), but work are reluctant to use phenol unless it's absolutely necessary. 

I'm relatively new to R&amp;D and previous roles have always had a single process that just works, so I don't have a broad view of what's out there. Suggestions appreciated!",6,2020-05-09 09:07:11,biology

5729,gg996x,Modifying a species gender ratio?,"Hi!

So cows and chickens have a problem! They have 50/50 gender ratio! As a result, everyday, male chicks are fed into grinders.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick\_culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_culling) 

Same goes for cows!  [https://animalequality.org/blog/2019/07/09/dairy-industry-hurts-cows/](https://animalequality.org/blog/2019/07/09/dairy-industry-hurts-cows/) 

So, what if we could modify their gender ratios at conception? That is a million dollar question!

So in chickens, we have ZZ (males) and ZW (females) In the chicken, the female determines the gender of the offspring. This is in direct counterpoint to mammals. In mammals, we have males with XY, and females with XX genes. Thus in mammals like cows, the gender ratio is determined by the father. 

So, if you wanted to shift the gender ratios of the population, you would be looking to introduce a fatal mutation somewhere on the chromosome of the parent that decides the fate of the offspring. 

It is probably easier to shift the gender balance in mammals towards female, and in chickens towards male by introducing fatal flaws in the deciding gender. 

The hard part is getting the gender shift ratio right. Get it wrong, and you just extincted a species... especially if your delivery vector were contagious!

So, how would you go about tackling this problem? Would it be perhaps a recessive gene that lived on the X/Z chromosome that causes the embryo to die at conception?  How would you deliver the modification to the population at large?",1,2020-05-09 00:04:20,biology
5730,gg96vf,Ms in Biology? Help!,"Dear r/biology,

I am having a personal crisis. I graduated with a Bs in Biology in 2015. My school offered no specializations; it is simply a general biology degree. As we all know, it is totally useless. I told myself that if I were ever to go back to school, I wouldn't make that mistake again. That I would only do so under some very specific circumstances, the main requirement being that the program lay out a clear path to a specific job. I didn't want to pursue another super broad program that would make me a jack of all trades, master of none. I want to actually learn/ master a hireable skill!  

So, I ended up applying to a university abroad for a program that I thought would fit the bill. Then, since you can choose a second program as your second choice, I tacked on the only other program that I would be eligible for at the school, which is an Ms in Biology specializing in Ecology, Behaviour, Evolution and Biosystematics.  

Well, you guessed it. I didn't get into the first program-- apparently my educational background didn't meet the requirements. But I did get into the Ms in Biology. At first I felt excited, because it's still an opportunity to immerse myself in another culture for 2 years, and I wouldn't be taking on any more debt/ loans. But then, the more that I thought about it, I realized that this program seems like the very thing I didn't want to do. I know the idea is that I would choose something specific to focus on, but just looking at the course schedule, it still seems like a random mishmash of biology courses, several of which wouldn't have anything to do with my chosen thesis.  

I'm torn because I'm finding that I am not really eligible for many graduate programs. Most want you to have really specific prerequisites that I don't have, and some want those prereqs to be taken within the last __ years and mine are expired. I've thought about taking some prereqs at a local community college, but I'd be paying out of pocket and spending a year just trying to become eligible to apply, with no guarantee that I'd actually get accepted on the other side.  

So what do I do? It doesn't help that in the present covid world, everything seems so uncertain. But still, I don't want to do this just because it's something to do. I want it to make sense. I would be living off of my personal savings while abroad, so in that sense it is still a financial investment as well as an investment of my time and energy. Is it worth it?

I know that lots of species individuals can communicate or use simple tools, but we don't see any that has such a developed communication as ours or any that use some kind of clothes, that builds complex houses etc.

With so many species in this world I think it is interesting to see there is an enormous intelligence gap between us and the other animals. Why is that? Why are we the only ones that don't live for eating and reproducing? Yes, I know that for example chimpanzees and other mammals have social relationships, but they are very simple ones compared to ours.

And time has shown us that developing intelligence is very useful in ensuring the survival of a species. Why we don't see any other species with very good intelligence nowadays?",34,2020-05-08 14:48:01,biology

So, truth be told, I don’t watch the news TOO often. I just despise modern media and being politics 24/7. All it is is politics and more infighting with nothing being done. Never any good news and never any interesting things to hear.

So, I was very shocked to hear that the U.S, ONE OF THE, IF NOT THE MOST DEVELOPED F***ING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, GETS #1 ON THE NUMBER OF CASES!

LOOK, I get why China had the issue and that reason is because their respect for knowledge and sciences is questionable considering they think Rhino horn with cure their hangovers, so it didn’t surprise me that someone got sick from eating untreated meat from an animal that LITERALLY NO ONE DOMESTICATED MEANING IT WAS EXPOSED TO ALL KINDS OF CRAZY SH*T!

*Cough*

But the U.S?! HOW?! We fucking helped win WW2, we basically won the cold war and sent a f*cking man to the moon! SO HOW DID WE FALL THIS HARD?! How many IDIOTS did it take to get it THIS bad to where we are at mercy to a tiny, insignificant speck of biological matter!?

5770,gfun8i,Perspective in research for a brazilian biology college student,"2020, oh yeah. These are dark times for research in general, there are spawns of every kind and everywhere. But here in Brazil? Let me introduce you:

The government is at this moment - maybe this has beggun a little earlier than this government - beheaded by conspiracionists who believe in every kind of weird things, from flat earth to messiah, everything. 

Historian never was a legalized profession in this country, but when the law project was going to be accepted, the president blocked with a veto in the last second possible, but not only a veto, his opinion and the opinion of the minister of education is to destroy every single science field that has something like humanities in it's grade because 'humanities do not help with economy and spread cultural marxism'. 

So what? You may be thinking. Biology has nothing to do with some budget cuts. Wrong. Now the minister and the president are putting ahead intelligent design into biology grades, saying that evolution was a mistake. 

Even worse, Amazon is now a 'economic wonder' and people are going in, killing everything, taking what they want. The ambiental police? Destroyed. Director fired. Many killed by miners with the argument that the president is at their side and they can mine what they want. Many native leaders are dead by this too and no repreension at all.

Oh well, there are always bloody bad governors, what could happen this time?

A Pandemy! With the crisis from COVID-19, scientists are being pursued in social media and in person by govern sympathizers for 'spreading lies' about the desease. Something I know that is happening all around the world. The issue here is just that weird projects, budget cuts that happened to history, philosophy, sociology, antropology are now stomping into biology.

So, with this very gramatical destructive text, I ask you: what should I do? I used to think in neuroscience, but in Brazil this is very hard to find. Not saying that doesn't exist.
I just can't see how to stay in Brazil to work with biology. And at the same time, it is hard to think on a country around the world that is being generous with this profession or needing some extra thinking minds. 

Of course I may be wrong or uninformed so I accept a discussion and hints to what to do.",2,2020-05-08 09:55:23,biology

5797,gfns0l,Why hasn't anyone cured nearsightedness yet?,"I think most nearsightedness is preventable and here is a purely anecdotal story to back up my claim. My parents are both immigrants to the United States from islands in the Caribbean. They had 20/20 vision until they got old. Now me and my sister, their only children, have awful nearsightedness and have to wear glasses all of the time. Additionally, I went to a youth group of about 20 teenagers who were also the children of immigrants, and like 80% of them had some sort of nearsightedness, while maybe two of their parents had nearsightedness. That's a giant jump.

Oh, and here's my case that nearsightedness is preventable. There is a study by Chinese researchers here: [https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2009/01000/Prevalence\_of\_Myopia\_in\_Urban\_and\_Rural\_Children.8.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2009/01000/Prevalence_of_Myopia_in_Urban_and_Rural_Children.8.aspx) 

and it basically says that urbanization is linked to nearsightedness, and it has nothing to do if the kids watch tv while to close to it or if they spend a lot of time reading. There are also a lot of other studies, even all the way back from 1988 that suggest similar things. The point I give you from this is that the correlation between myopia and bookishness may just be a confounding variable and city people may be more cultured from living in the city, and living in the city makes them nearsighted. 

Now, all the research points in this correlation between myopia and local industrialization, but the cause seems to be unknown. Is nearsightedness caused by city kids not having enough light? Is it caused by a vitamin A or D deficiency? Is it caused by not enough light? Is it caused by not enough outside light? Is it caused by not having to look far enough peripherally? Is it caused by pollution? Can we fortify our milk with good vision? The only option for a cure I see is some sort of animal testing since I think testing on children is more unethical, but what would be a good animal to use? Would mice suffice even though they may not have good vision ever? Can owls or cats get myopia in the first place?

I just feel like it's a shame that no one has come up with a cure yet, even though nearsightedness is an illness that affects so many people, how is it not thoroughly solved? I'd understand somewhat if it was a problem that only affects the poor and disenfranchised living in the middle of nowhere, but it actually affects many of the people who do research, and why haven't any of them considered researching why they need the glass directly in front of their eyes? Like, glasses are probably a billion-dollar industry, but if the causes behind nearsightedness could just be widely understood it would benefit a billion people.",6,2020-05-08 01:24:54,biology
5798,gfnobn,Career Advice for Recent Grad,"Hello biologists of reddit! Sorry for the long post ahead. I’m looking for career advice and guidance and maybe words of encouragement. 
I received a degree in biology from Florida State University in August 2019. During my time in undergrad I spent a lot of time in an ecology and evolution lab working with the sailfin molly. I loved every second of it. I also spent some time in another ecology and evolution lab specifically dealing with ornithology in North Florida species. Unfortunately during undergrad I became very ill and it took me a little longer to get my degree/received subpar grades. I was basically laughed at by the master’s program at FSU and told I would never be able to get into the masters for biology. 
I “settled” for applying to the master’s in public health at FSU because they accepted me. It’s a wonderful degree to have but it is just not for me. I have zero passion for it. 
I do however, have immense passion for biological oceanography but I lost my confidence in my ability to be a scientist. I want to further my education and know I need to prove myself in other ways because my GPA from undergrad is permanent. If anyone was ever in the same boat, or know someone who was, how did you get back into the field of biology? How do you get into grad school with subpar grades and GRE scores? Is this just a pipe dream?

5803,gflyc4,Question on viruses?,"I recently watched a youtube interview with ""ex employee"" of Doctor Fauci and there were many allegations regarding corruption of research and misguided treatment surrounding epidemics we have seen in recent years (SARS, ebola, HIV). While they sound interesting and almost like a plot of a movie, I realized juxtaposition in the video, between her open accusations and her scientific knowledge. Apparently she has a phD in Immunology or something along those lines, which gives me reason to believe that her basic views on viruses should be credible, right?

Onto the things that are confusing me:

1)  She states that ""Covid-19 is a RNA virus that a vaccine cannot cure/treat/prevent."" If this is true, why are we being told that researchers are looking for vaccines right now? Given her take, isn't looking for a vaccine irrelevant?

2) She also states that people cannot get the virus directly from eating a certain animal. She says that it would take up to 800 years for a virus to be able to evolve into something that can be transmissible to a human. If this is true, why is popular culture normalizing this belief that ""someone ate a bat and now we have a pandemic""? Wouldn't this be fundamentally impossible and why isn't that being debunked by knowledgeable people?

So, this may be a little long, and I would absolutely love it if someone wanted to be my cell-bio friend and let me ask them a ton of questions!

When proteins are being synthesized, as I understand it, they need instructions from DNA to get to the ribosome to then get the RER, the then get to the SER then to the Golgi body. I understand the latter half, from RER to exiting the cell (assuming this is an extracellular protein), but how does the information get to the ribosome? Are the ribosomes it get to ""free"" like how we see in diagrams? Or are they almost always on the RER? When I learned about organelles, I got the idea that ribosomes where almost entirely responsible for protein synthesis but that its also the role of the RER?

How are new organelles made? As I understand it, during mitosis, chromosomes split but in class, we never really talked about what's happening to the organelles. When I looked into the biogenesis of organelles, I said they split between the new cells, but not much more detail than that. This also goes for protein export; as I understand it for proteins to be exported they pinch off bits of the Golgi body to form vesicles, but how is more Golgi body made?

5843,gf9r7t,Interface theory of perception,"If anyone out there has read the actual academic study’s on this what do you think ? As someone with a lot of familiarity with the theory of evolution and the power of simulation and mathematics, I found this theory disturbing because I cannot refute it in a objective fashion. This theory showed through evolution maths and games, that natural selection does not favor the perception of objective reality. In fact, in these simulations species which viewed objective reality actually go extinct every time. If this is true, which it very well may be, then everything we perceive as objective reality is not true. This is not to say that it isn’t real, but that our perception does not give us the full story. 
I understand that ideas like this are not very popular, but after reading the study by Don Hoffman, I cant just shrug it off because the science was pretty solid.   Has anyone out there read these study’s themselves and came to a different conclusion ?",0,2020-05-07 11:26:26,biology

5852,gf7noa,Glycolysis,"Various steps of Glycolysis :
Introduction: 
➡️The term glycolysis is derived from the Greek word glykys and sugar (Glykys means sweet and lysis means splitting). The complete pathways of glycolysis was discovered by the three scientists namely Embden,Meyerhoff, And Parnas in the year of 1940.
➡️Glycolysis is the process by which a molecule of glucose is degraded to form two molecule of three carbon containing compound, pyruvate .
This happens by a series of enzyme catalyzed reactions.
➡️Glycolysis is regarded as  an almost universal central pathway of Glucose catabolism.
In some mammalian tissue cell types ( such as Red blood cell, brain ,sperm etc) glycolysis is the sole source of metabolic energy due to the breakdown of the 6 carbon containing molecule glucose, which provides energy.
➡️There is also present , many anaerobic microorganisms which are also completely dependent on the process of glycolysis,to acquire energy.
➡️Some aquatic plants are dependent on the process of glycolysis , for energy.
➡️ The enzymes which takes part in the process of glycolysis are present in the cytosomal fraction of the cell.
➡️If the process of glycolysis happens in the absence of oxygen then it is known as anaerobic condition,and in this condition lactate is the final product.
➡️And If the process of glycolysis happens in the presence of oxygen then it is known as aerobic condition, and in this condition pyruvate is the final product, which then further oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water.",1,2020-05-07 09:34:03,biology

First of all, I like to introduce myself: my name is Danilo, I'm a Biology graduating student from Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. I new in the Reddit, so sorry if I disagree in any way in this platform.

I see a lot of people in these days saying and asking about ""functions of a X estructure"", for example: what the function of vestigial organs? So here goes the answer: there is no function in any biological structure (BS). Not at all. Why?

We can define ""function"" thinking in the purpose of these ""things"". A chair have a purpose, a function. A TV, a cellphone, a pencil, etc, all these things have a function. So, why a BS doesn't have a porpouse? Because they evolve naturally, there is no mind behind this process. After all, a BS exists by sheer probability, luckily.

So, in conclusion, personally I prefer to use ""functionality"" or ""operation"", because this way, the weight of the proposition of the existence of a creator is left aside.

5879,geykfq,Inspired by other 5g posts - looking for the thoughts of those more educated than me.,"I was looking through some of the studies and I think (in my own head it raised questions) that maybe there’s some data that still should be investigated.

I think most of the ends I’ve gotten to have shown it needs more in depth research.

1) - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6765906/

Study looks at 94 different published papers. My curiosity comes from the effects that are lesser known, but I could just be uneducated. I don’t think this study serves much purpose besides my questions about the actual data.

Conclusion: 

*“Regarding the possibility of “non-thermal” effects, the available studies provide no clear explanation of any mode of action of observed effects.”

“Regarding the quality of the presented studies, too few studies fulfill the minimal quality criteria to allow any further conclusions.”*

2) - https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31991167/

*”The vast majority do not account for synergistic adverse effects of other toxic stimuli (such as chemical and biological) acting in concert with the wireless radiation”*

3) - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6250044/

*”A significant decline in sperm quality from 1940 to date has been well documented [2, 3] in association to increased environmental pollution and changes in the lifestyle [4]. In this regard, it is important to consider the contribution of electromagnetic fields (EMFs), since decline in sperm quality has been correlated to the level of industrialization and urbanization, rather than to a specific job [4, 5].”*

*”In particular, a marked reduction in germline cells, hypospermatogenesis, maturation arrest, and increased sperm with morphology alterations were observed after 7 days of RF exposure [122]; a decline in testis weight with increased DNA damage, marked reduction of seminiferous tubule diameter, and drop in sperm production and quality were reported under prolonged exposures [123–128].”*

*”Based on in vitro studies, there is a general consensus on the effects of EMFs from mobile phones, laptops, and other electric devices on human sperm quality with possible negative influence on fertility [67, 113, 131–135, 189–192].”*

While not tested in vivo I still think this is important.

“In conclusion, future and more standardized studies are needed in order to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying EMF challenge to reproductive systems and establish preventive strategies.”

4) - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569975/

This study isn’t significant either but they do share the same concerns about “chronic exposure” which is a large portion of people.

Conclusion:

*”However, they do not rule out the hypothesis of a possible indirect effect induced by chronic MMW exposure.”*

5) - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5607572/

*”Wang et al. [38] exposed Wistar rats to a 2.856 GHz pulsed microwave field for 6 min. The fields had an average power density of 0, 5, 10 or 50 mW/cm2. The results showed that at 6 h, 1 d and 3 d after exposure, the groups in which the average power density was 10 mW/cm2 or 50 mW/cm2 displayed significant deficits in spatial learning and memory.”*

*”The results suggested that chronic non-modulated, but not modulated, microwave radiation may cause anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors and calcium- and NO-related biochemical changes in the brain [77].”*

*”However, a recent report [3] published by the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) noted that discussions about the thermal and non-thermal effects are misleading. Because the frequency of microwaves is sufficiently high that the energy is absorbed, the subsequent heating of tissue becomes its major mechanism, and most biochemical and physiological responses are temperature-dependent. Thus, the committee suggested that in the future, studies should explore the border between thermal and non-thermal effects and that specific effects, such as triggering the onset of thermoregulatory reactions, should be defined.”*

6) - https://www.aph.gov.au/DocumentStore.ashx?id=854c0994-6f52-4749-86fc-cbafc3764559&amp;subId=672150

*” Our quality analysis shows that for future studies to be useful for safety assessment, design and implementation need to be significantly improved.”*

Right now it looks like I'll be going to the University of Georgia for grad school. I plan on applying to their Integrated Life Sciences PhD program, and applying to a couple of Masters programs as a backup.

Most students in the UGA ILS program have a tuition waiver and a stipend in exchange for working as a research assistant or a teaching assistant. This pays a minimum of 28.5k a year I believe.

My first question to y'all is, since I obviously haven't started grad school yet and haven't experienced the life, is this enough to comfortably live on, or will I likely need a second job? If so, what would you recommend?

My second question pertains to a job during undergrad. I currently have 11k in student loans, but if I get a job once this quarantine is over, I can likely do my last 2 years without them. This is an attractive prospect to me, and I thought while I'm at it, I might as well try to get research or lab experience at the same time.

It's pretty well understood that from birth, one's brain continues to develop a great deal. When one hits puberty, the brain is dramatically influenced by hormonal development. We also see that individuals that are in sex reassignment therapy will experience different ways of thinking as they take hormone therapy. 



This begs, I think, a very interesting question: in a potential future where both body modification (Cyberpunk, Ghost in the Shell, etc) as well as full Rebodificiation/Resleeving (Altered Carbon) is possible, does altering one's body dramatically change one's mind? 


It strikes me the most in shows like Altered Carbon, where one's identity and being is seemingly tied to a clear cut consciousness or even ""soul"" if you will. I notice that in these types of shows, the brain is ported almost perfectly into the new body, and the new vessel doesn't have much influence over that person.

We have a large ant; about the size of your thumb. It has a strong venom; let's say roughly half the intensity of a bullet ant sting. When this ant stings, it drives its stinger nice and deep. After injecting the venom with a great amount of force, it continues to inject... everything else. The entire contents of its abdomen; formic acid, sinus fluids, internal tissues. No air, but otherwise everything it's got using a pneumatic mechanism. 




How would this affect a human or other large mammal? What complications would the injection of foriegn tissue cause? What might be the long-term effects?

 A population of a certain size (say, 500 individuals) is more likely to go extinct if it has suffered a bottleneck effect in the recent past than if it has maintained a similar population size for many generations. Why? 

I answered: in longer established population genetics have evolved for a greater period of time than newer populations. this means older populations have a greater frequency of alleles than newer ones. newer populations can become extinct from the bottleneck effect due to reduced genetic diversity, genetic drift does not take into account an alleles adaptive value to a population, it may result in a loss of a beneficial allele or fixation of a harmful allele in a population.
 
Why is a rare allele more likely to be lost from a small gene pool than from a large gene pool (even if it occurs at the same frequency in both)?

I answered:the total set of gene copies of all genes in a population is called the gene pool. smaller populations are more likely to have more nonrandom mating which can affect the frequencies of homozygous and heterozygous genotypes which can erase an allele from a gene pool.",4,2020-05-05 13:37:43,biology

I'm trying to predict if I will go bald based on genetics so I can be ready to prevent it. My father is 43 and has a head full of hair. Out of 8 uncles, only one of them is considered bald and he is my dads oldest brother . My uncles on my mothers side(4) all have a head full of hair and they are in there late 30's to early 40's. Only one of them really shows slight signs of balding and it's really just a receded hairline. I've done a little research on genetics and punnet squares. My mother has thin hair and has had it like that ever since she was young. I don't know if she has female pattern baldness which is a homozygous trait for it to show in women. She is 43 as well. I don't think she has fpb but if she did doesn't that mean I have a 100% chance of going bald? My grandfather is 70 and still has a decent amount of hair for his age.

There is the variable region recombination and the somatic hypermutation which further diversifies. But what part of the Ig is actually unique? The variable region has a set number of recombinations that can occur. Are there sequences on an antibody that are entirely unique from Ig to Ig? I thought CDRs are unique but they also appear mostly conserved before the SHM. I read something about junctions being really diverse but can't find the source. in summary, what part of the ""variable"" region of an Ig is truly unique from Ig to Ig?

So, psychs put you in a higher dimension. Now we are not evolved enough to be able to withstand it and be fully in control of our motor skills, mental or physical. However, think about it logically. Our serotonin receptors, Kappa opioid, endecannabinoid, GABA receptors etc etc, any transmitter we know that can be used to turn into a psychedelic experience from psychedelic molecules, these molecular structures NEED TO BECOME OUR TRANSMITTERS. I.e. we have DMT neurotransmitters instead of 5HT2A or along with 5HT2A. Then you'll be walking around always being high but now its the new normal and you're body and brain would've evolved enough to be able to function there. If these organic living organisms contain these molecules, then theres no reason why consciousness can't but we just have it in our brains.

* First day - heaven and earth, light
* Second day - firmament 
* Third day - **dry land** and seas, earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed, and trees yielding fruit
* Fourth day - greater light to rule the day, and lesser light to rule the night, stars 
* Fifth day - waters bring forth moving creatures and fowl that may fly above the earth, great whales and every living creature that moves
* Sixth day - cattle and creeping things, and beast of the earth, man, male and female 
* Seventh Day - rest

But I also heard that the human body produces 100W of energy at rest, or 100J per second. So that would mean that the slice of bread should be expended in 4.4 seconds, yet eating bread fills our stomachs up for a good 20 minutes.

So I was wondering, is there something I'm missing, or is our body just really good at conserving energy?",3,2020-05-03 16:25:58,biology

Within modern times, it's clear that urban habitats cause certain pressures to be exerted on species living within (which is to be expected), but one thing I can't really shake is *human behavior* and how it might affect the evolution of species around them.

I'll just go out on a limb here: **If humans gain access to the technology required to simply rid themselves of any animal that they wish to get rid of (even more effective than modern weaponry/pesticides/etc.), would they evolve to appear less threatening to humans so as to not pose a threat?** I've been thinking about aposomatic coloration and Müllerian mimicry and how it affects human behavior towards said animals. Would there be a sort of antiaposomatic pressures on species to make themselves appear less threatening to humans? Are there species which already exhibit antiaposomatic morphology?

Keep in mind, I mean actively attempting to appear harmless, I don't mean something that would attract humans (as with adsomatism in plants in regards to pollinators), although that would also be an interesting thought experiment.",2,2020-05-03 12:43:47,biology

Dear biologists,

I'm a new teacher myself (I teach Maths &amp; Physics) but I'm also a part of a non-profit organization, the Inspiring Science Association. Our main goal is to enhance and encourage scientific vocations. We want to inspire young people to pursue a career in science by showing them how research is conducted and what it is like to be a scientist.

To do so, we have arranged the Online International Science Engagement Challenge (Online ISEC). Here, participants between the ages of 16 and 24 will have the opportunity to work on a scientific project designed to fit their interests and scientific background. These projects serve as an introduction to scientific research, while simultaneously being individualized and challenging. Students will be expected to work independently, delve into the available literature, and write a scientific report. They will work under the supervision and guidance of one of our knowledgeable mentors, who will support, guide, and encourage them throughout camp.

Online ISEC is a free, online initiative which will happen from June 29th to July 26th. Participants will choose two weeks within these dates to complete their projects. We are currently receiving applications! (Deadline is May 10)

This year I will be running some of the maths and physics projects so feel free to ask me more details. If you are interested or think any of your fellow students may be, please check our website or contact me! Any help to spread the word around would be indeed appreciated :)

Use the model to analyze the sensitivity of the Silver Springs ecosystem to cultural eutrophication. Remember that algae is a photosynthetic producer on the first trophic level. View the graphs to see how the different trophic level populations change through the simulation.

Based on your findings with the model, answer the following questions:

What is the maximum number of producers the ecosystem can support before higher trophic levels begin to decline? The starting level was 3236. Why?

I've come to recognize that this is probably a place where I can get insightful advice from people who know and so I actually went and finally created a reddit account so I can post. 

For years my dream has been to do stem cell research and this is what I want to do in the future! But I'm so confused about the steps to get there. I started college and went into biomedical engineering which at the time I thought was probably the only way I could get into research, but a few years in I've found out just how miserable I am in it because I don't like engineering and most of the BME classes in my university are mainly just focused on the designing of stuff and mechanics. Huge mistake on my part not figuring it out before. So I changed my major to Biology because I figured that if I need an MS and a PhD then I should do something that is more similar to what I want for my undergrad and then slowly start focusing on stem cells (if thats even possible). But now I'm just confused... I've been stressed out for a few months now about this all but I feel like I've reached my breaking point... so I'm also sorry about this post sounding a bit desperate.

To be honest I just really need advice... I love stem cells and I love research! I am constantly watching news about it and all my family sends me articles and stuff because they know just how passionate I am. I, in no way, want to give up this path, but I do need someone to maybe direct me a bit?

Sorry about how ranty this was but if someone here is doing research (doesn't necessarily have to be stem cells, just medical research in general), do you have any advice and important tips you could give me?

I'm a high school student and my team and I are looking to do research work on prebiotics, specifically comparing the efficacy of synthetic (from supplements) and natural (from foods like mushrooms, apples) **prebiotics in promoting probiotic proliferation**. However, we are faced with a serious problem. According to ISEF rules, we are only able to work with ***E. coli*** **K-12**. Well, we are technically able to work with probiotics like *Lactobacillus* spp., but we are **not allowed to culture them**.

This is what the guidelines of our school looks like: ""*Lactobacillus*, *Bacillus thuringiensis*, nitrogen-fixing + oil-eating &amp; algae eating bacteria introduced into natural environment (**except cultured in petri dish**)"" are **allowed for experimentation without prior approval**.

We are really at our wits' end, since we have had different proposals rejected several times and are unable to find any way which could satisfy the school's limitations and the novelty of our project required for its judging.

If anyone knows of a way in which we could **add prebiotics to probiotics in a simulated natural environment without the need of cell culturing**, please let me know by replying to this post, all help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",3,2020-05-02 11:22:44,biology

My only two guesses are that there is a mutation in the lacI gene, which means that it can't produce any repressorproteins and the expression of the lac-Operon couldn't be inhibited, second idea i got was that the Operator is mutated, making it impossible for the Repressor gene to bind to it.

6207,gc1l19,"Any and all biologists!! please read and correct my current opinion on plants and the consciousness of plants. I believe in reality based reality, so if you have any evidence/opinions to support or contradict the following, please comment.","It has already been proven beyond argumentation that plants are ""conscious"" in the most basic definition of the sense. they are aware of their immediate surroundings and able to react accordingly. More and more research is coming out indicating a greater awareness due to a certain memory capabilities plants possess. 

I believe that it goes much deeper than this. I believe that plants (trees as the best example) are extremely conscious. It has not been proven yet, but someday it will be. 

I say this for a few reasons. Anyone with basic scientific knowledge understands that biological functions develop and remain in a population because (through natural selection and evolution) those functions help a population survive. Obviously there is some advantage to the human ""consciousness and intelligence"", illustrated by the fact that humans are currently dominating the planet. However, we have only been around for 300,000 years. that is childsplay in the grand picture of the earth and all the organisms that have developed and gone extinct since beyond even 2 billion years ago. billion. 

The evolution of most animals in comparison to plants is quick and violent. new species pop up and very soon go extinct. some change into entirely different forms within half a million years. somewhere along the way we became rapid. quick moving quick thinking. and eventually ""conscious"". 

Now take plants. 400 million years ago when plants first started developing on land, they grew slowly and diversified slowly. The first trees appeared about 50 million years after that. they grew slowly. some species died yes, some grew into different types and different species, yet the basic fundamental form and shape of trees did not change much. over millions and millions of years that form altered but never to the extent of animal evolution. why? I believe it goes back to the old saying ""if it's not broke, don""t fix it"". Trees and plants must have something deeper than just photosynthesis keeping them from extinction over all these years. The name of the game is staying alive and thriving, and plants have been doing it far better and far longer than us. The oldest tree alive currently is a bristlecone pine tree in California, estimated at over 4,800 years old. To put this into perspective, that is 1/60 of the entire time humans have existed on earth. that is longer than christianity, much longer than we have been keeping modern calendars.

4,800 years. there is no one in this glorified money species that is going to convince me that that tree does not have consciousness. something far slower, and wiser than what we are experiencing right now. 

Some form of consciousness exists in plants. This isn't a reach. Because I'm not talking about the same type of consciousness we experience as humans. That cannot be possible due to the many physiological differences our two species have developed. However. J**ust because it is not the same, does not mean we can write it off as ""not existing.''** we have done this far too much as a species. 

We do so on the basis that we are just making sure to stay away from anthropomorphizing. ""Make sure you're not projecting your human experiences such as fear, nervousness, wiseness,*consciousness* on these other organisms"" a scientist would say. 

**Yet I believe that it is extremely arrogant and dangerous to assume that these experiences*****are*** **inherently human. Who decided that?** 

How can we say intelligence and consciousness are inherently *human.* This oversight is along the lines of saying animals cannot feel pain, because only humans are advanced enough to feel pain. This has been proven false time and time again. Consciousness, fear, pain. These are things we pull from some makeup of our body, some part of our DNA gives rise to them. DNA that we developed from many other animals, and even trees and plants if we look back far enough. 

We only develop and continue to develop biological assets that are beneficial to us. It makes sense by that logic that we may have lost or never even developed the capability to understand the kind of consciousness a tree has. we may have gotten on fine without being able to sense the things a tree senses. the same way we cannot see UV light the way bees and many insects do. it is invisible to our perception, *but that does not mean it does not exist.* The only reason we know the things we know about the earth now is through the development of scientific tools and mathematical equations that allow us to see more than our brains and eyes naturally can. We haven't gotten far enough to understand the full extent of plants and plant consciousness. that does not mean it doesn't exist. 

it is not anthropomorphizing when you sit in a forest and feel the presence of a tree. our human brains are brand new babies in terms of evolution, but our instincts are far older. what we feel about trees, is the truth. that deep calm and awareness when we are out in the forest, or anywhere surrounded by nature and plants, that is science. it just hasn't been proven. yet. ",5,2020-05-02 01:10:08,biology

As I said I can only see muscle performance growing, not the muscles growing in person, so should I just wait till my muscles reach their top performance in their current size before they will grow physically?

I have about a year of research experience in a lab in high school but nothing in college, and COVID has completely wiped out summer plans for me so I'm emailing professors about research opportunities now hoping I can get one in the fall and keep it for the last two years of undergrad.

&amp;#x200B;

My main goal is to get a PhD and I know I need research to apply to grad schools. It feels like I'm running out of time and if I can't find something soon it will leave me with too little time to get enough experience for grad school apps. I have a stellar GPA at a well-known state school and a decent resume, although I've had to work a lot of hourly customer service jobs to make money in school which doesn't really help for grad school. I'm really just missing research experience. I see my peers who have already started committing 15-20 hours a week in labs and part of me thinks if I can just lock up a spot like that I should be set for grad school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another one of my main concerns is I don't know how much I love the field. I find evolutionary biology in general to be really interesting for the most part but I see people genuinely craving knowledge and reading literature in their free time and, you know, I'll read papers, I don't mind them, and I would like to one day be on the forefront of scientific discovery, but I'd still rather watch a football game than read a journal, you know?

I received an overwhelmingly positive response and had lots of offers for interviews, so thank you guys for that. I interviewed u/prokrow, a who does research on Type I Diabetes. A few of you asked me to post his answers to a few questions here when I finished, so I'm just going to post the entirety of the conversation in case anyone was interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

●  The person’s name and position (job title, company name, and address) 

○ Jared Taylor. Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Alabama at Birmingham

● What’s your biology-related job/career?

○ I do research on type I diabetes. There’s a specific virus (coxsackievirus) that we think may trigger disease development in people with a certain gene variant in the IFIH1 gene. We have mouse models with mutations in this gene and we infect the mice with coxsackievirus and monitor for diabetes development by monitoring urine glucose levels. We can also do tests on human blood we get from donations, but due to ethical concerns we obviously can’t just go infect actual people, we’re usually limited to just mice. We can do in vitro infections of human cells but the findings are limited because they are not in the context of the whole body or microenvironment of the pancreas.

I comment that the human blood samples are probably more accurate to research, aren’t they? Do we do research on mice because they’re always available?

○ Yes and no. While the samples are genuinely human, we’re keeping them alive in a created environment, and when we infect a mouse it has all of its different types of systems working together so that could be seen as more accurate.

● What are your job responsibilities?

○ My job is to design and perform experiments. I am mostly independent but I do have a mentor that oversees my work.

● What’s a typical day or week like in this kind of position?

○ Usually, on Mondays I do a lot of planning on what kind of experiments I will be doing that week, then I do the actual benchwork on each experiment. Some can take multiple days. I also attend weekly seminars to keep current on the latest in the field and read the scientific literature.

● What kind of training (education or on the job) is required for your job?

○ I have a bachelor’s degree in biology and a Ph.D. in Immunology/Microbiology. There is also extensive on the job training related to specific experimental techniques that I may need to learn.

○ When I started at UAB I had to get trained to work with mice since I had not done this before. This involves how to ethically handle and euthanize mice and how to perform surgeries and harvest organs like the pancreas and spleen for analysis.

● Does your job/career require any continuing education? How do you keep current in the field?

○ Yes, it does, we keep current by going to 3-4 hours of presentations from our peers a week on the research they’re doing. It works really well as a form of networking as well because sometimes research can take years to get published and since we want to keep current we’d like to know about the research before then. We also read journals relevant to our field for a few hours a week.

● Your degree(s)? Where did you attend college?

○ Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Millersville University of Pennsylvania.

○ Ph.D. in Immunology/Microbiology from the University of Florida.

I asked him if he has a master's degree as well and he gave me a really insightful answer.

○ I don’t have a master's degree. In the past 20-30 years, we’ve learned so much in almost every single field of science. You used to be able to get your masters degree in 2 years then switch and do a 3-4 year Ph.D. program, but now with so much research going on since so many different people are getting PhDs a lot of us are going straight into a Ph.D. program after our bachelors and spending 5-6 years on that one research project.

I asked him what his Ph.D. dissertation was on.

○ I did my Ph.D. on HIV, and particularly research on how it avoids the immune system response. Particularly how it evades detection by cytokines. Specifically, I studied cytokines called type I interferons. Interferons signal to infected or nearby uninfected cells that there is a virus infection occurring and to put up their defense mechanisms. This works well for many viruses but not HIV. We wanted to know what mechanisms HIV may be used to evade this defense response.

● Favorite class? Why? Least favorite class? Why? 

○ In undergrad my favorite class was botany. I really enjoyed researching plants and did my senior thesis on them.

○ Postgrad I really enjoyed Introduction to Immunology.

○ My least favorite class in undergrad was organic chemistry. I felt like I had to memorize way too much material.

○ In postgrad, I didn’t really have a least favorite class since all of the classes I got to choose and we were really specialized.

● What inspired/motivated you to study biology/pursue a biology-related career?

○ After high school, I didn’t plan to go to college. I worked for two years on implementing industrial light fixtures and thought that would be my career. After installing hundreds of lights in a single day for 2 years I thought that I needed to do something else, maybe more mentally engaging. I knew I needed a degree in something, so I went to community college and just took general education courses. Nothing interested me so I dropped out after one semester, but then went back to university in Pennsylvania. I also took more general education courses as a start there. In my psychology class, one of the topics we learned was how the brain coordinates with the eye using neurons and I thought that was just the most interesting topic. I declared myself a biology major and learned that the eye is not the only interesting part of biology. I was originally going to do botany but switched to some health-related field because I thought I’d have better job prospects with something that relates to human health instead of.. plants.

● Advice for someone planning to study biology or pursue this career?

○ Study as many different topics as you can within biology. Today you can’t really do good research without having a great understanding of many different aspects of biology. Most research now requires a multi-disciplinary approach. Now I ask some of the questions I personally have for Jared.

● I understand your research doesn’t deal with infectious viruses, you research diabetes, but how has the lockdown been affecting your research/job?

○ Almost everything has come to a halt. The only research that’s considered essential is research concerning the virus itself. At first, we started cutting our hours at the lab and alternating schedules to not work at the same time or be near each other, but when we realized that this isn’t something that’s going to go away any time soon the university halted all research because they do not want to be responsible for further spreading of the virus. In order to get everything back up and running even if we started tomorrow it would take probably almost a month. The person who takes care of our mouse colony has less time to do so, so we have to call back about 25% of the colony. Rebuilding the numbers there will take time.

● Are you enjoying all your free time at home or would you rather be busy?

○ I’m actually enjoying all my time at home. I pretty much have nothing to do all day. I would like to have some sort of teaching job later in my career where it’s half online and half in person so I can work from home some days because I enjoy this. I respond and tell him that it just depends on what kind of person you are since some of my family members hate being home and would rather go out and be busy while others really enjoy it and are looking forward to retirement.

● When do you think the coronavirus situation will be under control? What do you think of states potentially reopening soon?

○ I think the situation will take a long time to get under control. If you look at the numbers each state is getting about a 4-5% increase in cases every day, even with all the precautions we’re taking. Also, another thing to consider is that each state’s numbers are certainly underreported. In my state (Alabama) I found out we only test a couple of thousand people a day for the virus so there’s certainly more people with the virus than we report. I add here that the virus also isn’t life-threatening to lots of the people that get infected so not everyone is even going to get tested and they’re just treating it like a cold and staying home-- or not staying home-- and waiting for their immune system to fix the problem.

○ It’s even worse than that too because the people that do want to get tested often get turned away because we just don’t have enough tests for everyone. I think that states reopening is definitely a very bad idea but it’s the politicians' choice, and they have to choose between the economy and human lives so they’ll obviously choose the economy. If states do reopen-- and it looks like they will, I think there will definitely be a second wave of this virus coming this winter.

● What do we have to be thankful for due to COVID19?

○ For me, personally, I got engaged about 2 weeks ago due to my girlfriend who lives in Florida coming up here and spending the lockdown with me. Had it not been for the lockdown it wouldn’t have happened for another few months probably. Also, I’ve been doing a ton of zoom video calls with my grad school friends.

6287,gbkhv1,What pressure lead hominids to begin hunting animals near to larger than their size?,"Hominids diverged from arboreal apes. These apes, along side a plant based diet, did require protein. However, due to our dentition (200+ PSI is plenty enough for jaw strength) lacking the ability to puncture and tear through thick animal muscle and fat, I would imagine it is safe to say, as with most other apes, we ate smaller animals such as insects, small reptiles, birds and mammals. These animals have a lot softer, less thick meat on them and small enough bones to where you could practically eat them whole. 

So what drove us into hunting? We didn’t have the dentition to chew through thick bovine flesh and lacked wide enough throats to tear off and swallow large chunks of meat, our acid was also presumably not strong enough to break down all of the meat considering the amount of parasites that can afflict us from eating thicker red meat compared to eating say, a rabbit raw (both are dangerous but you are more likely to get sick from eating raw cow meat). So we needed fire to help tenderizer the meat and kill the contaminants.

The thing is however, it takes so much more time and energy to make a fire, hunt a large mammal, carry this heavy mass of meat back and cut it apart. So to my understanding, there must have been some event that made these smaller prey animals much less frequent.

The Types of microscope

Microscope parts

Uses of microscopes

In order to understand the concept we will discuss the details of this topic the microscope invention types and uses step wise.

1.The microscope :

The microscope is a tool used to see very small things which are not visible to naked eye.

Magnification of microscope :

In order to produce clear and enlarged images of small objects which facilitate their study process, and also allows a clear view of the precise structures and objects for examination and analysis, and the mechanism of magnification is done through the force of magnification Magnifying the microscope, which expresses the number of times the objects are enlarged relative to the dimensions, but as for the accuracy of the microscope, it is a measure used to illustrate the smallest and most accurate details in the sample, and the precision is expressed in units of micrometres or microns,

[2] The invention of the microscope:

The invention of microscope returns Until 400 years ago, when simple devices were invented and with the progress of time and science, they were developed and improved, and a new microscope for multiple uses was developed.

In this article, the types of microscopes will be clarified.

[3] What are the types of microscopes?

The microscope is one of the most important tools used in biology and chemistry , so this tool allows enlarging objects and objects to look at them in detail, so it can be used to dissect small living things, such as: insects, or the formation of rocks and crystals through two-dimensional or three-dimensional magnified images, and there is Several different types of microscopes, as these microscopes provide different levels of magnification and production of different types of images. The types of microscopes can be illustrated by mentioning the most important types, which are as follows:

[1] Optical microscopy:

it uses optical lenses to enlarge the images resulting from the passage of electromagnetic waves , [3] and this microscope is used to study single-celled microorganisms, such as small parasites , and different types of bacteria , which is the simplest and most widespread type of microscope.

There are two types of this microscope:

[a] Simple optical microscope:

It uses only one lens to zoom in.

[b]Compound optical microscope:

it uses a set of lenses to increase magnification.

[2]Electron microscope:

This microscope uses beams of electrons to enlarge samples, and these electrons have a much shorter wavelength than visible light, so that the accuracy is much higher, and their lenses are distinguished by electromagnetism .

[3]Scanning Electron Microscope:

Used for spectroscopy.

[4] Effective electronic microscope:

It is used in biology to study the internal structure of cells; such as mitochondria and organelles.

[5] Contrast microscope:

Used to study the details of living cells and other transparent organisms by adjusting contrast. Adjusting contrast indicates dark background to the sample, where it is easier to see light samples on darker backgrounds.

[6] Interference microscope:

This type of contrast is used in the difference of light to study the physical and chemical properties and their impact on living cells and other biological materials. This type provides high accuracy to measure the nanometric dimensions in measuring height, which range in size from microns to millimeters.

[7] Polarized light microscope:

It is used to distinguish between materials through the process of polarization and analysis of light, and this type is used in the study of geological samples to examine the nature of crystals and to analyze the details of refraction and stress in biological structures.

 Microscope parts:

To show the types of the microscope, it is worth knowing the most important parts of it, as there are many different types of microscopes, and it is noticeable that they are all similar in some of the basic parts and shape, and here comes the statement of the most important parts of the microscope:

[1] Ophthalmic lens:

This is the lens through which the user looks to see the enlarged sample.

[2]Lens tube:

The tube that connects the ophthalmic lens to the objective lens, and this lens is near the samples to be seen.

[3]Arm:

Connects the lens tube to the base, and through the arm the microscope must be carried when transported.

[4]Base:

Provides support and stability to the microscope, and the base contains a light source.

[5]Illumination:

Provides a lighting source that is highlighted on the sample for visibility.

[6]Platform:

It is the slide on which the sample to be studied is placed, so that it is installed to locate the slide more accurately.

[7]Nasal segment:

This segment contains the objective lens, so that the microscope user can rotate it to switch between the objective lens and adjust the magnification force.

[8]Objective lenses:

Objective lenses combine with ocular lenses in order to increase the level of magnification, and the microscope is characterized by the presence of three to four objective lenses.

[9]Stop Adjustment Tool:

This tool prevents users from moving object lenses by becoming close to the slide, causing damage to the sample or slide.

[10]Condenser lens and eyebrow lens:

The capacitor lens and eyebrow lens work together to focus the light source intensity on the slide containing the sample.

What are the uses of the microscope?

The uses of the microscope differ according to the type of microscope, the method of its manufacture, and the goal that was invented for it. When asked about what are the uses of the microscope, the type of microscope must be determined first, then the question is asked about what are the uses of the microscope, and the types of microscopes and their uses are the following:

¤Uses of Optical Microscopy:

A simple microscope that has a single lens based on enlarging the image to 250 nanometers, and can be used to study the life cycle of a cell in living cells, such as bacteria.

¤Uses of Digital microscope:

It is an improved type of optical microscope. Instead of seeing the sample through the lens, a type of sensor is used, such as the one in the digital camera, to obtain an image and display it on a computer screen, and is used to protect the sample from damage.

¤Uses of Compound microscopy:

It is a light microscope that contains two lenses, and is used to give a true image of the sample where each eye can see the sample completely, which makes the image of the sample three-dimensional, which is most used in school laboratories, to study blood samples and see red blood cells and white blood cells.

¤Uses of Electron microscopy:

Where electrons are used to pass through the sample and give an image of it, it can be used to see ribosomes, viruses, and nucleic acid cords in high resolution and in a three-dimensional image of samples, as it is used to make very small electronic circuits on silicon slides.

¤Uses of Scanning microscope:

There are several types of scanning microscopes used in mapping samples of samples through the flow of continuous current and recording its movement through the computer and creating an image or a map of the studied sample. It is used to make pictures of the movement of atoms .

¤Uses of Anatomical microscope:

which magnifies the image up to 300 times larger than the original, gives three-dimensional images, and such microscopes are used to see the details of large tissue after dissection such as insects and flies.

6307,gbfijt,A Serum That Signals Macrophages To Alter The Spleen To Promote Red Blood Cell Production During Anemic Stress," 

## A Serum That Signals Macrophages To Alter The Spleen To Promote Red Blood Cell Production During Anemic Stress

Anemic stress promotes an emergency production of red blood cells. It is best understood in mice where it occurs in the spleen. However, emergency red blood cell production in both human and mouse utilize signals and precursor cells that are different from regular red blood cell production. These precursor cells are capable of self-renewal but they are restricted to become red blood cells. Inflammation and anemic stress promotes the production of these precursor cells but they do not turn into red blood cells until a specific serum level increases. This specific serum promotes the transition of these precursor cells into red blood cells by acting on the macrophages in the spleen. During the production of precursor cells, macrophages produce protein that promote the production of precursor cells but inhibits them to form into red blood cells. When this specific serum is on high level, it changes the biosynthesis in the macrophages to stop producing the protein, thus promoting the formation of red blood cells from the precursor cells.

In the last 10,000 years, humans and livestock have destroyed 98% of land vertebrate species biomass. Our green crop fields are so poisonous, they kill all birds, fish, frogs and insects that come within miles of them. There are so many poisons in the biosphere that all vertebrate species are rendered biologically emasculated, feminized and infertilized.

Mass extinction is preceding runaway hothouse chaos. Within this century our oceans will become super saturated with carbon and destroy most of the plankton on earth. In other words, earth won't be fine without us.

I am 16 years old. My goals are to become an anesthesiologist and also to research future technological treatments for my muscle condition, Minicore Myopathy, which is a form of Muscular Dystrophy. My condition is non-progressive and I can walk independently though I have weak lungs and heart. I hope to be able to do research both in college and after to help find cures and developments for my condition. My disease doesn't get a lot of love in the research department.

I'm interested in this so much because I frequently look up therapies that are being used for other diseases but could also apply to be. While you guys are using this therapy for Becker's it could also apply to my condition. As the formation of mini cores on muscle biopsies in Minicore Myopathy has been linked to Mitochondrial absence or dysfunction. This treatment could help me tremendously as it would not only promote mitochondrial biogenesis in me but it would also promote other key proteins that are important in muscle growth and repair (Over-expression, a theory which I am currently studying). I would love to find out more about this treatment and if I can possibly use it in the future. This therapy has immense potential to help many Muscular Dystrophies, not only Becker's like you guys already know. This would especially help me out as my genetic mutation still hasn't been found so having something to overexpressed other genes to compensate for my unknown faulty one is good. I wanted to know if you guys knew about this and if it could theoretically work for me. Alright thank you so much for your work and stay well!

I would really appreciate it if someone would look over this for me. Basically, my understanding is that an odds ratio less then 2 isn't much to worry about, however, this paper came up with a 3.9 OR for 10-year users. Study:

#### BACKGROUND:

Radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones is concentrated to the tissue closest to the handset, which includes the auditory nerve. If this type of exposure increases tumor risk, acoustic neuroma would be a potential concern.

#### METHODS:

In this population-based case-control study we identified all cases age 20 to 69 years diagnosed with acoustic neuroma during 1999 to 2002 in certain parts of Sweden. Controls were randomly selected from the study base, stratified on age, sex, and residential area. Detailed information about mobile phone use and other environmental exposures was collected from 148 (93%) cases and 604 (72%) controls.

#### RESULTS:

The overall odds ratio for acoustic neuroma associated with regular mobile phone use was 1.0 (95% confidence interval = 0.6-1.5). Ten years after the start of mobile phone use the estimates relative risk increased to 1.9 (0.9-4.1); when restricting to tumors on the same side of the head as the phone was normally used, the relative risk was 3.9 (1.6-9.5).

#### CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings do not indicate an increased risk of acoustic neuroma related to short-term mobile phone use after a short latency period. However, our data suggest an increased risk of acoustic neuroma associated with mobile phone use of at least 10 years' duration.",11,2020-04-29 13:12:08,biology

I have a few ideas for grad research that I'm interested in, but I'm unsure whether these would be viable options and wanted some advice. 

I have a huge interest in studying mycology. I think its a vastly untapped field but it seems as though there aren't many options for studying fungi at the graduate level. I've come across some work stating that certain mushrooms produce antiviral compounds for bees that are more effective than anything man-made thus far.  I live in a state (ND) where beekeeping is huge. ND is actually the #1 producer of honey in the country. I think the potential for research here is huge. I just want to know if you guys think this is a path worth pursuing or not. 

Mycology in general is very under-researched in the great plains. We even have a few mushroom species native to the area that are being investigated for their anti-cancer properties (phellinus linteus) and I've been thinking that could also be something I could study in grad school. I'd prefer to stay close to ND but if push comes to shove I have no problem going anywhere to study my passion.

However, there still are a few studies that are worrying me and this is one of them, could someone please take a look if it won’t be too much trouble?

Abstract
Exposures to electromagnetic radiation mainly from the extended use of mobile phones may initiate biological damages in the human body at the macromolecular level. Several studies on human and animal models have shown significant changes in the functions of neural cells. Present empirical study analyses the thermal changes and the specific absorption rates (SAR) of brain, eye and skin tissues due to prolonged exposure to mobile phone radiation. A phantom, simulating human head with skin, skull and brain was used for the study. The Phantom was exposed to radiation for longer durations (600 s and more) and the temperature variations at different specific points were studied with sensitive thermocouple probes. SAR (1 g of contiguous tissue) values were determined using the variations of temperature and other parameters. The average rise in brain temperature was found to be 0.10
±
0.05 °C at 30 mm deep in the brain and the estimated SAR was 0.66 ± 0.35 Wkg-1. The increase in temperature for the eye socket was 0.03 ± 0.02 °C with SAR 0.15 ± 0.08 Wkg-1. The average rise in temperature for skin was 0.14 ± 0.05 °C and the SAR was 0.66 ± 0.42 Wkg-1. Although the measured SAR lie within the safe limit of 2 Wkg-1 recommended by the international regulatory body, considering the tremendous growth in the number of mobile phone users and prolonged use of mobile phone in communication purposes, the cumulative effects could be a real concern for human health.

While in reality, there is the case of the white and black peppered moths in England, during the time Darwin was Alive. 
To put it as short as possible;
In the early 1800's, in England, there was a type of moth called a peppered moth. They were cream with brown spots and would use birch trees to camouflage. A study found there was a varietion that would sometimes occur, causing the moth to be entirely black, this meant they couldn't hide from predators and so would be eaten. there were so few that they went mostly un noticed. 
Then came the industrial revolution, fossil files were burned and smog was everywhere, Layers of sutt covered the birch trees, this meant that the white peppered moths now stood out aand were easily picked out by predators, while the black peppered moths could camouflage, survive and breed to pass on their genetic mutation. 
By 1948, the population of the black peppered moths  had increased alot and their existence was documented. 
Studies were carried out and in 1895,it was recorded that there were 98% more black peppered moths than white peppered moths. 

Surely this is enough to prove Darwins writing on evolution by natural selection, so why don't more people know snout it?",105,2020-04-27 23:17:03,biology

Tl;dr is I've been working for 3.5 years in biotech and enjoying it but I'm confused about my next steps - MSc while I work and try to fight the stigma as I move up the ranks or should I bite the bullet and go for a PhD? 

I work in molecular biology and immunosequencing currently. Good amount of technical lab experience, data analysis etc. I'm fine with this role, and I could move through R&amp;D with the trajectory I'm on currently. 
I really would like to end up working with viruses and/or gene editing, my primary interest is molecular virology. I would like to stay in the lab for my career, but have an impact on the field I'm working in and would like to be able to have some say in what I'm doing (experiment and topic wise) within my role. 

I feel that I should get more education, partially just to buff up my resume by having a graduate degree but mostly out of interest. I found a couple MSc programs I can do while I work and move up at this company, but I'm worried that I'll still hit a ceiling and not be able to achieve what I'm looking for without a PhD. 

Will a MSc in infectious disease and industry experience get me to where I want or will a PhD be necessary to reach that point?

Note that this is in relation to some species being more fertile under slightly changed conditions (such as the multiple species that dogs descend from crossing and being more fertile under domestication). 

I guess I’m just trying to parse this paragraph. I get it, when things in nature are slightly changed, the “vital forces” gain in power. By what mechanism is this occurring?

6563,g90xkk,Questions on SARS-CoV-2 infection,"In the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the infection of pneumocytes 2 in the alveoli (if extensive such that the threshold is exceeded) would result in inflammation. Inflammation will cause vasodilation and a decrease in blood volume due to increased membrane permeability of vessel walls for the migration of immune cells to the site of infection. The increase in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier is also the main cause of pulmonary edema. 

An immune response too strong could result in a sharp decrease in blood pressure, causing patients to go under septic shock and possibly multi-organ failure.

However, 

The infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is essential for the conversion of angiotensin 2 to vasodilation factors. Angiotensin 2 stimulates an increase in blood pressure by increasing sodium and hydrogen ion exchange in the proximal convoluted tubule in the kidneys (increasing salt concentration in the blood which results in an increase in blood volume via osmosis from the surrounding tissue fluids), down-regulating sensitivity of the baroreceptor reflex, etc.. The infection of cells expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 resulting may lead to a net decrease in these mechanisms regulating the blood pressure. Therefore,  why do people still die from septic shock or multi-organ failure as a result of it, if the mechanisms to regulate vasoconstriction is reduced?

Also, people with hypertension are more prone to developing more severe symptoms from the infection. I am confused as to why that is the case since their high blood pressure would off-set the decrease caused by the inflammatory immune response?

Where have I gone wrong? Are there factors I have not yet considered? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.",2,2020-04-27 08:43:58,biology

6577,g8wlwe,Hearing Impairment During Old Age,"Hearing Impairment During Old Age 

Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is the result of genetic predispositions combined with various environmental factors that affect the inner ear and accumulate during a lifetime. Several genes may be involved in old age hearing loss. Mitochondrial DNA common deletion levels in human cochlear tissue are related to the severity of hearing loss in individuals with age-related hearing loss. In addition, it appears that reactive oxygen species formation and cell death are key events in the development of the disease. The environmental factors contributing to age-related hearing loss cannot be specifically determined but may include smoking, exposure to loud noise, and the use of drugs which include antibiotics such as gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, loop diuretics, and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). ARHI does not follow a single pattern and may potentially be accompanied by either one or more of the following: an age-dependent loss of sensory hair cells and/or auditory nerve fibers, and degeneration of the cochlear tissues.

6581,g8vooq,A brief summary of modern research.,"Out of hundreds and thousands of diseases affecting humankind, we pick up a certain disease which is mildly interesting yet well recognised by governments and grants. Now these diseases have a culprit which is often a pathogen and if you are lucky enough a mutated gene. The most important part of the research pipeline is doing fancy RNAseq or GWAS or Highthroughput protein interaction assays. This should give you a list of other proteins which interact with your protein. Now at this stage if you survey the literature you will see that all this was well studied in articles from 1970s-1990s. So you decide to identify a very specific problem with one particular article that you read one particular night when you were genuinely inspired to do science. For this you decide to employ a novel, cutting edge technique. Design a novel paradigm and design a perfect experiment with amazing control experiments which will cover all drawbacks.
But every silver lined cloud has a big dark centre. You need to order 10 highly specific, costly reagents. Which thanks to your mediocre funding are unavailable and even if available, reach you 6 months later than the date of order. The next 3 months you spend in optimization of reagents just to realize that the reagents you got were spoilt en route to you. So whatever results you got from the dialed down experiments are either faulty or incomplete. So you decide to use other technique and spend the next year through the same exact process.
Till either you are worn out or your funding.
Finally you decide to write a paper and submit it. The reviewer as cheeky and lazy as they are read one particular line and one particular result with prejudice and misconception just to give you either extremely relevant but time consuming, gut wrenching experiment or a simply a humiliating  response just for submitting a sub-par experiment. Yet, motivation thrives in you and you swallow your ego and go through the loops and get it published.
You achieve what? 2-3 citations from your own lab and some rare citations which help you to contribute to the next protein interaction culprit. All this for science? All this for knowledge? No all this is for the next disease, the next mildly interesting protein and its mildly interesting interaction, but that is well funded by the scientific community than what you have worked on for 5 years.",4,2020-04-27 02:05:27,biology

The spectrum of light goes well beyond the red and purple/blue that we see but most peoples’ perception of that spectrum, despite having a wide range of colors outside of what we can see, seems to be a continuous, cyclical gradient. Red and blue combine to make purple despite a large gap in the wavelength of the light. But we don’t perceive the transition from one to the other any more or less jarring than a transition from blue to green to yellow, despite how different the transition between the actual wavelengths would have to be.

**Looong form**: I'm a junior studying for a B.S. in molecular biology, and I'm a wreck. My GPA isn't bad, (it's above 3 on a 4-point scale), but it isn't *good* either. More than that, my resume is as barren as a dried-up riverbed.

I don't mean to sound whiny or entitled, so I'm sorry off the bat if I come off that way.

I'm pretty sure I need to go to graduate school; it's necessary to begin any kind of serious career in biology. I don't know what program to apply for, and the idea of doing so terrifies me. If I had my choice, I'd probably study ecology and/or evolutionary biology, but since I chose molbio for undergrad (it seemed the ""sensible choice"" at the time compared to general biology), and since eco/evo seems difficult to find any sort of job security in, I'll probably have to apply for a microbiology M.S. or something like that, with the end goal of working in biotech or pharma. I wouldn't like it as much, but that can't be the deciding factor. What masters degrees would you recommend?

Regardless of what I go for, the process terrifies me b/c I don't have a GPA that screams ""exceptional academician,"" nor do I have any experience outside of instructional labs that could make up for it. On top of that, I know from the undergrad app process that I interview like a rotting tree stump. I don't have much going for me, so what - outside of giving up on it all right now - would somebody with experience here recommend that I do?

Of course there's always the option of graduating with the B.S. and trying to take a gap year or two before applying for grad school. Here I'd run into similar issues: Say I try to find an internship or job to build up my resume during this time. How could I? Where would it make sense for me to apply? I don't have anything to offer to begin with, so how could I get hired or accepted? And if I eventually apply to grad school, would the gap year or two look bad? I'm fairly certain I could swing the GRE studying on my own, but while we're here what advice would you give about that? Are the subject tests worth the hassle?

Thanks a *million* to anyone who reads all of this nonsense, and to anyone with any advice at all. I value it immensely - because I really need it. Cheers!",10,2020-04-26 13:39:18,biology

in our local scuba diving community in south west Germany, we run a project to do conservation activities. It's in our freetime, we're not professionals. We are  ""only"" measuring visibility and temperature on a fixed underwater station. The temperature is currently being automated with a sensor constantly measuring data - so far so good.

Now I would like to do further measurements and gather more information. I could go into the direction of fish identification (even if rare) or plant identification. Also, it could go into the direction of measuring more values (ph value?).

Now I need ideas or some input on where I could start as a non-biologist (I'm a software engineer) what I could do/measure/collect/document that could:
 a. be helpful data in the future to document ecological change
 b. give information about the current quality of water/plants/nature.

Wouldn't this mean that if a mosquito bites Person A and they're infected, then goes to Person B who isn't infected and bites them, that they'd potentially infect Person B from the blood they've already ingested from Person A?

6653,g8a2lr,Brucella abortus is a bacterium...,"*Brucella abortus* is a bacterium that utilizes an unusual sugar, erythritol. The concentration of erythritol within the *B. abortus* cell is 10 mM, while the external erythritol concentration is at very low levels, such as 0.20 mM. What is the energy requirement for the inward transport of erythritol at 37°C under these conditions? 

Answer: Begin with the equation: Δ*G* inward = + *R T* ln \[S\] Inside / \[S\] Outside

As *R* = 1.987 cal/mol-K and *T* = K = °C + 273, the above equation is: 

Δ*G* inward = + (1.987) (37 + 273) ln

While reading it I learned that an extracellular vesicle could envelop a nonenveloped virus, like hepatitis A, and could infect cells (latter half of body paragraph 4 if you are curious). 

Since viruses cannot replicate outside of a host cell, how would the envelopment of viral material outside of a host cell be classified? Since vesicles originated from the body's cells, would this be a very peculiar instance of virus genesis since it did require the existence of host cell material to become infective (since DNA/RNA is polar and therefore not permeable across the cell membrane)?

## Abstract

 Saffron (*Crocus sativus* L.) produces the most valuable spice and it has various medicinal, aromatic, and dyeing uses. It is sterile and asexually propagated through progeny corms. Its genetic variability is limited, but an extent of phenotypic plasticity is stated and epigenetically explained. To our knowledge, few studies and limited data are available to identify the performant accession to develop an efficient clonal selection. In this study, a multifactorial design of four Moroccan accessions is considered in two different cultivation sites for three years, with 7440 plants that were individually analyzed. Analysis of variance shows that ‘Agadir melloul’ (L2) accession is significantly qualified as superior in both locations, especially in the second coastal site (S2). Performance scoring and ranking and principal component analysis based on eight quantitative traits confirm the superiority of S2L2 compared with other combinations. Moreover, the number of flowers per mother com trait (NF) showed high phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation. This character is very heritable (0.59). This heritability is associated with high genetic advance (11.11) and high genetic advance as a percentage of the mean (1.13). Hence, this key trait is less affected by the environmental variation, and clonal selection can be scored through this character. It is then possible to enhance the mean value of the number of flowers from 9.82 to 20.93 through direct selection among the collection. This study is useful in the choice of performant accessions with the aim of improving saffron productivity.

6682,g83em0,COVID and asthma?,"So I was wondering are asthma patients considered “at risk”. 1/13 Americans have asthma according to the CDC and only 5% of coronavirus deaths have been people with asthma. You could say that their isolating better but their death rates not changing based on age. Almost no one under 19 who has asthma has died because of their asthma.

6683,g83bdb,Should a 95 year old dying of COVID really count towards death rates?,"So I’m asking this because if a 95 year old dies of the flu, we don’t really say the flu killed them we usually assume it’s because of their age. 

Like, old age isn’t a disease. It’s because you got sick and your body can’t handle it anymore, not because the virus is super deadly. 

In people under 30 the survival rate is practically 100% (it’s close enough for that age range) if you don’t have underlying conditions. 

I just don’t think we should be touting these numbers like 7% death rate or even 20% I’ve heard. But that’s only elderly people, I hear all these healthy young people who are talking about how they’ll die if they get the virus when statistically that’s not going to happen. In fact it’s literally 0% if your 19 or under and only a few people under 35 have died. It doesn’t really get to numbers that matter unless you had severe underlying conditions or your over 65.",1,2020-04-25 18:05:02,biology

Hello I'm currently doing my undergraduate degree in wildlife management. I'm about to go into my second year. I want to be as prepared as possible in order to apply for some good ecology and evolutionary biology programs. Next semester I'm taking the following classes:

-Data Visualization in R

-Biometry

-Ichthyology with the lab

-Botany with the lab

-English

​

My school does not have many research experiences in any other areas that are not biomedical so its really difficult for me to find research in ecology.

Her argument in class was that our artificial microRNA has to be expressed in our viral vector as DNA not RNA and it will be incorporated into our organisms genome as transposable element so that it can be incorporated in our hosts’s genome.

6708,g7wf6p,Creating a primer using RT-PCR and PCR. I need help!,"  

So as my title states, I am creating a primer using RCT-PCR and PCR... and I really need help!  
 

These were the instructions I was given in my microbiology class:  
 

**This is an actual sequence for SARS CoV-2. Design a primer that is 10 nucleotides long that will give at least a cDNA strand of at least 30 nucleotides.**

**5'-UAAUUUCCAAAUAUGGAAGGGUCCAUUGUUUGGUUGGUUGAAAGCUAG-3'**  


I created my cDNA strands with the primers using RCT-PCR and PCR. I sent my work to my prof who said that I had the concept down but to remember to place my primer in a position to give me the correct product length. This confused me for two reasons because he said at “least” 30 nucleotides in his instructions. However, I’m guessing he meant 30 nucleotides TOTAL. I just don’t understand what happens to the rest of the sequence if I place the primer towards the middle?? Do the nucleotides on the 5' end just go away?! Someone help. Hopefully I explained this in a way that makes sense. I’m just so confused.

6754,g7hbrq,"Human evolution: How did we survive if we couldn’t outrun, detect nor overpower predators?","This is something that has been driving me crazy. We are built for stamina running, yet that is seemingly quite useless if a big cat can close the distance in 4 seconds, you usually need comparable speed to barely keep out of distance before stamina kicks in to effectively avoid predation, but humans are tragically slow and we don’t even have the ability to preform sharp turns without losing balance, even now, trying to outrun a Hippo, a massive herbivore not even evolved for speed, is a terrible idea because on average, they are nearly twice as fast us.

So now onto senses, improved height is great to see the surroundings, there is one issue however, we don’t have that good of peripheral vision... We can only see a 120 degree angle, 240 degrees of which a camouflaged leopard can sneak into... Binocular vision is great for hunting and analyzing the environment in high detail, the thing is however, good luck hunting if you cannot stay alive in the first place.

Then there is our strength... Sure, we can beat a mouse in an arm wrestling competition, but a Hyena, eeeeeeh, maybe if it was crippled, by that I mean it actually has no muscle tissue. If a predator were to tackle us... Game over man, that’s something you will NOT survive.

And regarding intelligence, intelligence is great for building tools, but it takes a while to actually learn how to, the first walking hominids probably didn’t know how to even make a rock pointy, it took a few generations before one of them learned how to make a rock sharp, each of those generations probably being eaten up and torn limb from limb.

Study 1:

Background

Nowadays mobile phone is very popular, causing concern about the effect it has on people’s health. Parotid salivary glands are in close contact to cell phone while talking with the phone and the possibility of being affected by them. Limited studies have evaluated the effect of cell phone use on the secretions of these glands; so this study was designed to investigate the effects of duration of mobile phone use on the total antioxidant capacity of saliva.

Methods

Unstimulated saliva from 105 volunteers without oral lesions collected. The volunteers based on daily usage of mobile phones were divided into three groups then total antioxidant capacity of saliva was measured by Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) method. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 19. ANOVA was used to compare 3 groups and post-hoc Tukey test to compare between two groups.

Results

Average total antioxidant capacities of saliva in 3 groups were 657.91 µmol/lit, 726.77 µm/lit and 560.17 µmol/lit, respectively. The two groups had statistically significant different (P = 0.039).

Conclusion

Over an hour talking with a cell phone decreases total antioxidant capacity of saliva in comparison with talking less than twenty minutes.

Study 2:


BACKGROUND: Handheld mobile phones (MPHs) have become a Ôcultural’ accessory device, no less so than a wrist watch. Nevertheless, the use of MPHs has given rise to great concern because of possible adverse health effects from exposure to the radiofrequency radiation (RFR) emitted by the device. Previous studies suggested correlation between MPH and salivary gland tumors. 

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether MPH induces physio- logic changes in the adjacent parotid gland, located on the dominant side, in terms of secretion rates and protein levels in the secreted saliva.

MATERIALS AND METHOD: Stimulated parotid saliva was collected simultaneously from both glands in 50 healthy volunteers whose MPH use was on a dominant side of the head.
RESULTS: A significantly higher saliva secretion rate was noticed in the dominant MPH side compared with that in the non-dominant side. Lower total protein concentra- tion was obtained in the dominant compared with the non-dominant MPH side among the right dominant MPH users.

CONCLUSIONS: Parotid glands adjacent to handheld MPH in use respond by elevated salivary rates and de- creased protein secretion reflecting the continuous insult to the glands. This phenomenon should be revealed to the worldwide population and further exploration by means of large-scale longitudinal studies is warranted.

6806,g734c9,Research finding influenza vaccination associated with increased risk of acute respiratory infections - COVID-19 implications. What are people's thoughts?,"&amp;#x200B;

Disclaimer: this is in no way an ""anti-vax"" post - it is intended as a serious open discussion as to possible interplay between Influenza vaccination status and non-influenza acute respiratory viral infections, including Coronavirus / COVID-19.

To begin with, these two studies found increased risk of acute respiratory viral infection amongst recipients of influenza vaccine, with (non-novel) Coronavirus amongst the identified pathogens:

[Study #1 - Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/)

[Study #2 - Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017-2018 influenza season.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607599)

The CDC attempts to refute the first of these on their [Influenza vaccine misconceptions page](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm) as such (bold emphasis added for discussion below):

&gt;There was [one study](http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/12/1778) (published in 2012) that suggested that influenza vaccination might make people more susceptible to other respiratory infections. After that study was published, many experts looked into this issue further and conducted additional studies to see if the findings could be replicated. **No other studies have found this effect.** For example, [this article \[99 KB, 5 pages\]](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/57/6/789/329048) in Clinical Infectious Diseases (published in 2013).

However the article / study they cite \[[ref](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/57/6/789/329048)\] appears to have several shortcomings, notably:

1. It examines a restricted and differing cohort, namely children &lt;5 years old and adults ≥50 years old
2. The results appear to demonstrate a \~1.5% higher rate of non-influenza infections amongst flu vaccine recipients, which is likely dismissed as statistically insignificant - which is fair, but equally not an overwhelming debunking of the other studies.
3. Ironically the study itself cites other studies which confirm the effect, thus undermining the CDC's claim that ""no other studies have found this effect""

&gt;Other studies have found evidence of an association between influenza vaccination and infection with a non-influenza respiratory virus. In 2008, a study of influenza vaccine effectiveness in Australian children 6 to 59 months old found that influenza vaccination was associated with detection of other respiratory viruses \[15\]

Further undermining the CDC claim that ""**no other studies have found this effect**"" can ironically be found in the following, which for all intents and purposes **was a CDC study** (i.e. received CDC funding, involved their own researchers, and saw their review and approval). It found increased risk of acute ARI amongst children &lt;18 years old who had received the influenza vaccine.

[Study #3 - Assessment of temporally-related acute respiratory illness following influenza vaccination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X18303153)

&gt;Vaccinated individuals were no more likely to get influenza after influenza vaccination; however, patients’ experiences of illness after vaccination may be validated by these results which suggest increased risk of ARI caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens following influenza vaccination among children &lt;18 years.

Study #3 provides a balanced perspective (quoted below), noting the intention is not to undermine recommendations around the flu vaccine, but rather illustrate nuances (e.g. improved targeting, timing) and possible dangers that may be relevant to kneejerk recommendations around flu shots amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Systemic capture of influenza vaccination status amongst confirmed cases of COVID-19 is also of interest.

&gt;… the results of the current study should not be interpreted as a reason to change the recommendation for universal vaccination for prevention of influenza, a potentially severe illness with complications such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, hospitalizations, and death

occurrences and abundances. Assuming some years had passed and things like crop formations had reverted to a mostly wild state.

Obviously they would see a huge extinction period that we caused, but wouldn't be directly apparent that we caused it.

Although I can think of them using phylogenetic testing and fossil records to see how so many species jumped huge distances around the globe to a new spot (invasive species being introduced to areas they would never make it to on their own).

Also possibly zoo animals like a polar bears surviving and possibly establishing a population in places like California without being genetically/morphologically different enough from natural populations to suggest natural migration.

6844,g6se3z,How is caloric expenditure calculated for physical activities?,"I've recently had the revelation that lifting weights doesn't burn many calories and that running/walking is significantly more effective in burning calories. I'm trying to get a rough idea of how these numbers are calculated.

Here is a rudimentary calculation:

Let's assume average of 50 kg weights with an average movement of 0.25m and 200 reps and 25% efficiency.  
Work = Force x Distance

100 kj = 50 \* 10 (gravity) \* 0.25 \* 200 \* (1/0.25) = 24 Cal

Running is a bit more complicated given the interactions with friction etc.

Now these calculations are obviously incorrect, I was wondering how one would calculate something like this? I googled it and it seems like you roughly burn 70 Cal for every km, how is this number achieved? How about for weights?

How much does ones perceived physical exertion affect these numbers? E.g. If a person can easily life 100km 8 times, but will bearly be able to lift 160kg 3 times, how much does this affect the caloric use in the movement?

The general consensus of the Youtube videos I've watched seem to imply that lifting basically is incomparable to cardio in terms of caloric usage, would like to see how these conclusions were drawn.",2,2020-04-23 13:49:56,biology

How can it evolve this self-sacrificial trait when doing so kills the ant, disallowing it to pass its genes onto its offspring.

6865,g6mpef,Its just a piece of the Genome," 

A chromosome is a term derived from the Greek word which means Colored Body. It is a microscopic particle with a large filamentous form. It forms an organized structural package in the form of an X-shaped consisting of the nucleic acid (DNA). The DNA strand supercoils over histone to make chromosome.

* Chromosomes were first discovered by a Swiss scientist named Carl Welham in 1842. Later it was called a chromosome by Valdher Hartz, a reference from him to the susceptibility of these highly colored bodies to certain dyes.
* The [DNA](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-dna/) is present in the cell as a network of coherent lines. When the cell division process begins, the filaments of the network accumulate in the nucleus as lines of varying lengths and shapes known as a chromosome.
* The numbers of chromosomes differ in the cells of living things. They differ in humans from monkeys, elephants, and butterflies.
* A human cell possesses a total of 46 chromosomes that are residing in the cell in the forms of 23 pairs. The numbers of chromosomes are not related to the size of the organism. Elephants have 56 chromosomes in each cell, while 380 chromosomes are in the cells of the butterfly.
* To facilitate the process of studying chromosomes, the nucleus is depicted during division, and the chromosomes are arranged according to their length and shape into groups.
* Chromosome lengths are up to meters, but the protein and protein-assisted wrapping process reduce the size to nearly 8,000 times.
* The process by which chromosomes are arranged or organized is called karyotyping.

## Functions of Chromosome:

**Functions of chromosome:** It shows details of the human, as any person has 46 chromosomes, so they are in pairs &amp; there are 23 pairs, &amp; these pairs are numbered from 1-22, but the 23rd pair isn’t given a number because it is the sex-specific pair Thus, a person has half chromosomes from mother &amp; half from father.

Let us go through some other important functions of chromosomes and that are listed below:

* Chromosomes are responsible for determining details of a person’s composition, such as eye color, skin and hair, and small body composition.
* The chromosomes are responsible for determining the gender of the newborn, as the chromosomes are denoted by the letters Y and X, and this is determined by the gender of the newborn.
* Chromosomes have a role in determining the incidence of certain diseases such as Down Syndrome and Werner Syndrome.
* Chromosomes are responsible for determining intelligence, fear, anxiety, and cowardice.
* It has a function in determining the functions of the body’s growth, and in identifying traits.

**Following are some more functions with chromosome numbers:**

* **Chromosome #1:** It plays a role in appetite and nerve growth.
* **Chromosome #2:** Relates to diseases such as [bowel cancer](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer/) and difficulty learning.
* **Chromosome #4:** has a role in the teeth and their early fall.
* **Chr #5:** Managing your sense of stress and calm.
* **Chr #6:** This chromosome relates to fertility, feelings and milk production in infants.
* **Chr #7:** Regulates red blood cell production and keeps skin soft.
* **Chr #8:** It is related to hair loss and baldness.
* **Chr #9:** It has to do with blood type determination and nose odor understanding.
* **Chr #10:** It has to do with excessive appetite and thus obesity.
* **Chr #11:** has a role in determining personality, and it also plays an important role in developing tumors, also protecting teeth from caries.
* **Chr #12:** Its role is to determine intelligence and body length or shortness as well, related to alcohol allergy.
* **Chr #13:**  Has a role in autism and breast cancer.
* **Chr #14:** It is related to human deafness and Alzheimer’s disease.
* **Chr #17:** It has to do with feelings of fear and physical strength.

6921,g6436b,Is this trial that reversed aging in humans worth taking seriously?,"In September 2019 Fahy et al. [published](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028) results from the TRIIM (Thymus Regeneration, Immunorestoration, and Insulin Mitigation) trial. Their stated goals were to investigate whether they could restore the immune systems in eight healthy older men (ages 51 - 65) using a combination of recombinant human growth hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone and metformin. While they achieved impressive on-paper results partially restoring the [thymus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymus), the most impressive result came from their [epigenetic measurement of aging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetic_clock) of subjects in the trial.

Fahy et al. had successfully reversed aging in their subjects according to four epigenetic measures of aging. The effect size was large: each measure indicated an average gain of over 2 years after 1 year of treatment.

In other words, if hypothetically a subject was 60 years old at the beginning of the trial, both chronologically and epigenetically, then by the end of the year they would be 61 years old chronologically but less than 59 years old epigenetically.

Of the epigenetic measures of aging, GrimAge is thought to be the best available predictor of lifespan. From [the paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6366976/) introducing GrimAge,

&gt; Using large scale validation data from thousands of individuals, we demonstrate that DNAm GrimAge stands out among existing epigenetic clocks in terms of its predictive ability for time-to-death, time-to-coronary heart disease, time-to-cancer, its strong relationship with computed tomography data for fatty liver/excess visceral fat, and age-at-menopause.

Fahy et al. demonstrated a mean age reversal of 2.16 years after 1 year of treatment according to the GrimAge measurement (see Table 1 in [the paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028)).

Fahy is reportedly spearheading a new trial, called TRIIM-X (see [this part of his recent TEDx talk](https://youtu.be/PFg-OMHvI2E?t=968)). He hopes to investigate the effects of a modified version of the same treatment with the benefits of a larger trial and a more diverse set of participants.

The skeptical side of me has a few questions:

* Is a reversal of the epigenetic clock good evidence that aging was reversed, or is there a good theoretical reason to think that you can reverse the epigenetic clock without reversing “true” aging and thus increasing lifespan?
* What is the base rate of trials with this level of success actually being true? I know that clinical trials are known for having low success rates, and this particular study only had eight participants, but the effects reported were large. *All* measures of aging showed substantial reversal, and Fahy et al. recorded independent evidence of aging reversal such as the fact that kidney function had increased in the subjects, and at least one subject grew hair back.

6959,g5swnc,Looking for career advice as a recent Wildlife and Conservation Biology Major,"Hello everyone,

As the title says I recently graduated with a BS in wildlife and conservation biology, but I’m having trouble choosing a career path. I loved working outdoors during my college courses, and doing the research projects, but I have no research experience other than research projects done for class. However, I currently work at my local ASPCA as an animal care attendant, and my boss has offered me a promotion to dog training assistant. She really thinks I should pursue certification as a dog trainer due to how capable I am, and how much I enjoy it. So I guess my issue is that I do love dog training (because I love animal behavior, I.e. franz de waal, temple grandin, Konrad Lorenz, etc), but I also love wildlife biology. I’m afraid I am leaning towards becoming a dog trainer, because it’s the path of least resistance, but also because I don’t see a lot of opportunity in wildlife biology with a BS and no research experience. I’m also very worn out on academia, and am VERY hesitant to go for a masters degree. 

To help with giving advice here is some background on me. I originally had taken a year off between high school and college. I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to go to college for (I was torn between music, and biology), and I knew i wanted to save some money first. I’ve never been exceptionally academically driven, but do fairly well nonetheless. I ended up getting my General education credits out of the way at a local community college. I then went on to a state university for my degree. However, as I pursued my BS I never gained experience doing research (besides through my assignments). Most of my experience is wildlife/animal care, and education (interned under a zookeeper, interned taking care of raptors, taught nature programs through my states Audubon society, and I currently work at my local ASPCA). 

Is there any overlap between wildlife biology, and dog training? Is it possible to use dog training as a stepping stone into wildlife biology research later? Should I sacrifice my promotion to see if I can gain research experience to make a more informed decision? 

If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1,2020-04-21 21:23:41,biology

Looking for opportunities in bio geared towards female high school students. 

Quick background, I attend a highly ranked STEM magnet high school which (as expected) is heavily male dominated, our school 72% male as of this year. While this class makeup does provide a unique hs experience, certainly with some pros, it can become overwhelming constantly being one of 2-4 girls in a class of 18. (Almost all of our teachers are male as well, and after taking near 16 classes I've had only one female STEM teacher.) My school has provided me with some amazing opportunities and I've done some great programs, but still they are all like my school day experience in male to female ratio.

I was wondering if anyone knows of some excellent female science programs / mentorships (online options would be great during this whole period) where I could for once be surrounded by female students who love STEM as much as I do, and possibly connect with professional female scientists as well.

All the organelles within it are performing perfectly their pre-defined jobs. There are about 37 trillion cells in the human body. If any organelle inside the cell’s body stops working for any reason then there will be a problem reflects in the form of illness/sickness to the organism.

## Types of cell:

There are two main **types of cell**, [Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic cells](https://24hoursofbiology.com/difference-between-prokaryotes-and-eukaryotes/). Eukaryotic cells are those that contain their DNA enclosed in the nucleus but a Prokaryotic cell is the opposite of it which contains its DNA freely moving in the cell’s cytoplasm without a nucleus.

**Remember** these two types of cells are not present in the same organism at the same time. Actually these types of cells decide the type of organism. As there are two types of cells, obviously, there will be two types of organisms prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.

Let us discuss organisms that are made of these two types of cells: If we talk about humans then humans are eukaryotic multicellular organisms WHILE bacteria is a prokaryotic unicellular organism.  Multicellular organisms made of multiple cells but unicellular organisms are made of single cells and all the life activities are going inside only the single cell.

### What are Cell Organelles and Components?

**What are cell organelles:** These are the components that are working inside the body of cells. The jobs they are performing are pre-defined. If any organelle inside stops performing its job then there will a problem arise in the form of sickness to the organism.

### Components:

**Components of cell** include many different parts, each with a different function, and some of these parts are specialized structures that perform specific tasks within the cell. cells can be considered a complex machinary. The components working inside are also called cell’s organelles.

📷

**Cytoplasm:** Cytoplasm is actually inside cavity of the cell, and it consists of gel-like fluids called Cytosol/Cytoplasm, and other structures that surround the nucleus.

**Endoplasmic Reticulum:** It is a network like organelle that helps to address the particles created by the cells, and transferred to the specified destination, whether inside or outside the cell.

**Golgi Apparatus:** The Golgi apparatus collects the molecules that have been treated by the endoplasmic reticulum, to be transported out of the cells.

**Lysosome &amp; Peroxisome:** Lysosomes and Peroxisomes are the recycling center in cells, where foreign bacteria that have entered the cell are digested and they get rid of the toxins in the cell.

**Ribosomes:** Ribosomes are organisms that address the cell’s genetic instructions for protein formation. These organisms can float freely in the cytoplasm, or they can be connected to the endoplasmic reticulum.

**Mitochondria:** Mitochondria is considered an energy house of the cells. It works to make energy from the food into a form that can be used by the cell to perform various cellular activities.

**Plasma Membrane:** The plasma membrane forms the outer lining of the cells which separate them from its environment, and allowing materials to enter and leave it.

**The Nucleus:** The nucleus is considered a center of guidance in the cells. It sends commands to the cells to grow, mature, divide and die, and it contains the [DNA](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-dna/), and the genetic materials of cells. It is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane, which works to protect the DNA and separates the nucleus from the rest of the cell. 

There are 46 [chromosomes](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-a-chromosome/) in the nucleus if the number deviates from the original there may be an abnormality.

**Biology Definition:**  it is defined as the science that searches for characteristics that distinguish humans, animals, and plants from non-living things, such as growth, reproduction, nutrition etc. The biology is derived from two Greek words: 'bios' means life, and 'logos' meaning logic or study.

it is a science that specializes in studying the cellular structures of all life forms; simple ones such as bacteria that make up a cell one.

## Characteristics of living things

Living organisms are distinguished in all their forms with characteristics that distinguish them from inanimate objects. Among these characteristics are

* **Regulation**: Living organisms are distinguished by having a complex and independent structure, starting with the basic unit from which all life forms, that is, the [cell.](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-a-cell/)
* **The need for energy**: All living things need the energy they obtain in the form of food in order to carry out their metabolism and to survive.
* **Growth**: All living organisms grow and increase in size, and they can rebuild their cells when exposed to wounds.
* **Reproduction:** All living things are distinguished by their ability to produce new individuals.
* **Response**: All living things have the ability to respond to different stimuli.
* **Adaptation:** It means the ability of an organism to respond to the requirements of the environment in which it lives.

## Biology Branches

Biology is divided into many branches, including

1. Botany,
2. Biochemistry.
3. Cellular Biology.
4. Ecology.
5. Evolutionary Biology.
6. Genetics.
7. Molecular Biology.
8. Physiology,
9. Zoology

## The relationship of biology to other sciences:

Biology is a link between other natural sciences, and here are some examples that explain the relationship of biology to other sciences: \[1\] **Biophysics**: The science that uses theories of physics and mathematics to analyze some issues related to biology. \[2\] **Astrobiology**: The science that links biology and astronomy, and specializes in the study and development of extracellular life forms. \[3\] **Biogeography**: The science that explains the interpretation of the distribution of living things in the places in which they live.

\[4\] **Biomathematics**: Science that specializes in the study of topics and aspects of biology, using mathematical techniques and models. \[5\] **Bioengineering**: science that uses the principles of engineering to understand and analyze biological systems, and uses the principles of biology to analyze the principles of engineering science and its systems. \[6\] **Sociology**: the science that examines the role of biology information social construction of individuals, and their culture, and relations between them.

## Basics of biology

Among the basic concepts related to biology are the following:

* **Homeostasis:** Balance or internal stability or the ability of an organism to maintain and stable the internal temperature environment,
* **Cell Theory:** The theory of the cell developed by the scientist Rudolf Virchow in 1855 AD states that the bodies of living things consist of cells, and that living cells originate from previous living cells.
* **Gene Theory**: It states that genes are transmitted from parents to offspring through the transmission of hereditary material, knowing that genes are part of the chromosomes, and they are formed from the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid [(DNA).](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-dna/)
* **Evolution**: The theory of evolution assumes that all living organisms originate from a common ancestor and that the differences that appear between living organisms are caused by genetic mutations, as the scientist Charles Darwin assumed that evolution also occurs through natural selection; that is, the living creatures that are able to adapt to its environment, which remains and inherits its characteristics to its children while living organisms that are unable to adapt to their environment die.

7072,g4w5zl,In desperate need of advice for my post-bachelor academic career,"I'm terrified. I had originally started a Bio undergrad in 2014. Uncontrolled depression led to my dropping out after the first semester. I worked for 3 years pulling minimum wage until I decided to start over my education and applied to community college. From community college I transferred to the local state school. 

Community college was supportive but did not prepare me for post-bachelor plans. I have only been able to get a research internship my junior year once I had transferred. The problem was lack of exposure, if anything. I know I could have done more those first two years.
I'm approaching my senior year and I only have one year of research behind me. I have not thought of volunteer work until now, almost at the end of junior year. I have only established contact with a spare few professors. My summer internship prospects are completely destroyed by coronavirus. My GPA is 3.77. My depression has come back when weighing all these options and my current grades are much below that mark. Because of the virus my university has allowed every class to be pass/fail which they will all appear as on my transcript.

I want to be a wildlife researcher and nothing else. I am comfortable scraping the bottom as long as I am scraping the bottom outside in the field. Do I even have a chance at pursing a graduate program? Would I be able to find myself in a PhD program? Will those pass/fails hurt my chances even if they dont hurt my GPA (they include Ochem 2, Mol/Cell bio, and physiology)? Since I would be applying during winter I would only have one semester to boost my research resume.

Any and all advice is welcome. I I don't want to live my life in regret.",4,2020-04-20 11:38:37,biology

7154,g47tk1,Can someone help me with this study?,"Hi, over the past 4 months I have developed a fear of phone radiation which is ruining my life, could someone please help me interpret the findings of this study?

Oxidative stress has been implicated as a mechanism of potential health effects that may result from exposure to Radio Frequency Electromagnetic radiation (RF-EMR). A cross sectional study was designed to investigate and analyze the biochemical effects of RF-EMR emitted from mobile phones at 835 MHz and 1900 MHz bands on some biochemical markers: Superoxide dismutase (SOD), albumin, amylase, uric acid and cytochrome C in the saliva of young men (18-37 years; average age 27.74 ± 8.08). EMF caused a significant increase in the activity of SOD but a significant decrease in that of amylase in the saliva of people after using mobile phones. The increases in the activity of cytochrome C and the concentrations of albumin and uric acid were not significant. A true correlation between the salivary antioxidant biomarkers and the number of calling min., rather than the number of calls, was found. These oxidative changes may result in metabolic changes in the living cells up to oncogenic transformation. Thus, based on these findings, it is recommended that a long-term/or excessive use of mobile phones, especially by young individuals, should be avoided. This goal can be accomplished by telehealth technology promotion activities targeting the more sensitive ages, children and adolescents, since their developing brains absorb more EMR from a mobile phone. Such activities include: group discussions, public presentations and mass communication through available electronic and print media sources.",5,2020-04-19 08:39:55,biology

Abstract
The objective of this nationwide study was to assess the association between cellular phone use and development of parotid gland tumors (PGTs). The methods were based on the international INTERPHONE study that aimed to evaluate possible adverse effects of cellular phone use. The study included 402 benign and 58 malignant incident cases of PGTs diagnosed in Israel at age 18 years or more, in 2001-2003, and 1,266 population individually matched controls. For the entire group, no increased risk of PGTs was observed for ever having been a regular cellular phone user (odds ratio = 0.87; p = 0.3) or for any other measure of exposure investigated. However, analysis restricted to regular users or to conditions that may yield higher levels of exposure (e.g., heavy use in rural areas) showed consistently elevated risks. For ipsilateral use, the odds ratios in the highest category of cumulative number of calls and call time without use of hands-free devices were 1.58 (95% confidence interval: 1.11, 2.24) and 1.49 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 2.13), respectively. The risk for contralateral use was not significantly different from 1. A positive dose-response trend was found for these measurements. Based on the largest number of benign PGT patients reported to date, our results suggest an association between cellular phone use and PGTs.",4,2020-04-19 08:25:00,biology

\-------------

Hi guys, 

So I am a little bit confused on what's the exact difference between pluripotent and totipotent cells. From what I know, totipotent cells can transform into any cell type, and pluripotent cells can transform into any cell type except the placenta. Also I have been taught that you can create a whole organism from totipotent cells, but not pluripotent.

I don't get how though. Does it have something to do with the placenta?

Also, if totipotent cells can create a whole organism from one cell, does that mean that you can create a human being from these?

What happens to these cells as we age? Like are they still there? Because if so, then technically shouldn't we be immortal?

Thanks for all the help.",9,2020-04-19 05:01:49,biology

# Discover a Species: Yeti Crab 

Scientific Name: *Kiwa hirsuta*  
The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack pigment, and is thought to be blind. The ""hairy"" pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. This process is known as chemosynthesis. Lipid and isotope analyses provide evidence that epibiotic bacteria are the crab's main food source and other related species have highly-modified setae (hairs) on its 3rd maxilliped (a mouth appendage) which it uses to harvest these bacteria.

My lab instructor warned us that there would be EtBr in the gel and if we weren't careful we would get cancer in ~10 years. This made me worried because I had cuts/cracks on my hand so I skipped the lab. However, we do lab notebook checks and so I had to come into contact with everyone's notebooks who did the lab. I know this may seem irrational to some people but basically I'm worried that traces of the stuff could be all over my things now. Also I touched the sink in the lab maybe a week later (I didn't think anything of it until after I did it) without any gloves (we didn't do a lab that required it that day) &amp; my sleeve touched the sink and then touched my pants. Freaked me out after because I realized there could be chemicals like Etbr on the sink handle. I washed those clothes twice but I'm now worried that I contaminated my other clothes and washing machine after reading that on a website. I understand some people don't take the ""dangers"" of EtBr very seriously, as I have seen some posts where people say there's not enough evidence and such. But I also come across websites from universities that say to be extremely cautious since it is a mutagen. Can someone tell me if I should be worried about this?

7174,g41ntl,questions about running subcloning,"Hi, so I'm planning on trying to make recombinant DNA. The way I see the protocol right now is basically:

1: cut out insert from donor plasmid with restriction enzymes

2: cut open a plasmid vector with the same restriction enzyme

3: ligate the insert into the plasmid vector

4: transform recombinant DNA

I'm currently stuck on step one because I need to separate out the insert from the cut open plasmid DNA. Normally I would use a gel to separate the insert from the plasmid, but I don't have a gel box currently. Would it work if I just cut the donor plasmid and the vector in the same test tube. In theory, the insert would get cut out and get connected to a nearby vector. I could use different restriction enzymes to make sure the vector and donor plasmid don't just fuse back together.

Heres a theoretical protocol of my idea, if it didn't make sense

1: add donor plasmid and vector into a microcentrifuge tube

2: add restriction enzymes to the tube

3: add DNA ligase and buffer

4: wait a while

5: transform recombinant DNA

Also, where would I buy the vector plasmid? I ideally want an MCS with a couple of different restriction sites, and with kanamycin resistance. Although the antibiotic resistance type isn't very important.

We need to look at the bigger picture here. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. There are cases where the student didn't study enough and got bad grades and now the student refuses to except responsibility so the student blames everyone else.
2. However, there are also cases where the student is correct in assessing that the teacher genuinely does not like the student and purposefully gives bad grades. This scenario requires proof. Also the student needs to mentally reflect why the teacher does not like him, what events lead to this, and what he can do in the future, and/or how to build better relationships with people.

This is a story about Professor Aly (not real name). Professor Aly got a biology lecturer position at a top tier uni in the USA. She can't make tenure position yet because she is still studying for PhD at uni ABC. She also does not have speculator research, high research index, or enormous funding from the NIH/NSF/DoD or whatever government agency. Usually all these things are looked at whenever the dean selects a professor to be on the tenure track. Also, masters and PhD candidates can be adjuncts and supplement their own tuition by teaching intro-undergrad classes. Or they can be TAs at intro to upper level classes. This is normal.

Over the years, Professor Aly has shown her true colors of being a sham, a con, and overall nut job. While she was a PhD candidate at Uni ABC, along the way she must have left or been fired from her lab because the PI removed her from the lab's official website. \[More details below\].

Her PhD is something along the lines of computational neuroscience. It sounds fancy and hard. It is. I don't doubt or look down at some people who either fail out of a tough PhD or they leave because they are no longer interested in academia. *I don't judge. STEM PhD is hard.*

However, what is odd by me is the sheer number of unrelated classes taught by Professor Aly. I said I was fine with her teaching introduction to bio since that is a very basic class. I myself had 2 years of biology before entering college so introduction to bio was a breeze. Since she was a Computational Neuroscience PhD, she also taught a Computational Neuroscience class.

But Professor Aly was teaching other classes such as Genetics, Biostatistics, Molecular and Cell Biology, Advanced Molecular and Cell Biology, and Nutrition. None of those classes seem related to her field of study, and in class she demonstrated that she had no level of mastery. She would make a lot of mistakes. She would also teach outdated information especially in the field of Molecular and Cell Biology. Even in the advanced fields which were approaching graduate level work and recent research papers, Professor Aly showed that she did not have the slightest clue what was going on in the field, in research, or what the paper was about.

**She would even read a retracted paper and not know what retracted was, and that the information was garbage**.

Her teaching style was poorly executed too. She often spoke too fast. Even when students tried to ask her to slow down, she refused. She wanted to get out of class 30 minutes early every day because it was clear she did not know the material enough to teach. Eventually she stopped trying to read and summarize research papers for us. **She moved onto reading the Huffington post, and other popsci content**. She approached psuedoscience territory by promoting vitamins as cures for cancer and diabetes.

Only in 2 classes did she grade the material. As the University policy dictated that most midterms and finals needed to be short answers and long answers to prove knowledge: *having exams be written left the door open to subjectivity and interpretation.*

If exams were all multiple choice, then it's either right or wrong. Either you selected the correct bubble or not. This also leaves the students grade to chance or luck as random circles can determine your fate.

Anyway Professor Aly abused that written exam policy to her advantage. If she didn't like a student, she would give students straight C's and B-'s, which are straight killers especially for Biology majors who are Pre-meds and want a 3.8 GPA (or A- in all of undergrad classes) to apply to medical school).

If you tried to politely ask why you got a bad grade, **she would say the answer is wrong. When you show her Google or the textbook, she would say your answer wasn't detailed enough**.

***\^That is how she abused the written exam policy.***

But students that she did like: their exams could be filled with garbage or the wrong answers and they would still get full credit. Students have pushed pseudoscience and homeopathy on genetics exams and still got credit. Or students wrote completely wrong information, as debunked by Google and fact checked by established and qualified biology PhD professors.

Professor Aly only graded 2 classes herself. The other classes, she allowed an undergrad TA grade everything. Since the TA was an undergraduate student, and the same age as the rest of the class, you can already see the shear favoritism and corruption in this grading. Also many of the TAs were not qualified to grade. Yes MANY TAs. I have had *TAs who were finance engineers* who took only 2 biology classes and they were grading exams. There is also the potential FERPA violations of letting your peers see your entire exam and homework and university login credentials.

One TA even accidentally leaked everyone's grades on Snapchat. This actually happened.

Behind the backdoors of the TAs, they talked about how much they hated Professor Aly because they got abused, she blackmailed them, **she made them do stupid things like count ketchup packets in the cafeteria and write a report about it.**

She and another biology professor were eventually caught because they stole money and used that money to pay their TAs in University XYZ. Yes, she stole money from this uni to pay for her TAs in another uni.

Many wanted to report Professor Aly but they knew they couldn't because they would jeopardize themselves. In addition to teaching core classes required to graduate, and thus your fate was sealed by her discretion,

Professor Aly was also an advisor and a pre-health committee member. So in order to get a biology degree, you needed to kiss her ass for 4 years straight. If you wanted to go to medical or dental school, you need a health committee member's letter. She has denied this letter to at least 10 students who all left crying and confused as they were ineligible to apply. Some had decent GPA of 3.5 \[not super competitive, but semi-competitive\] yet she still would not let them apply. She forced students to take SMPs or Post-bacs or masters.

Why was she even on the health committee when she had no relevant experience or degrees to prove herself? She never been to medical school nor had a MD, PhD, or DO.

So now imagine having 6 Cs on your transcript and being in lecture with a complete nutjob who didn't even teach real science and who wasn't a PhD scientist herself.

Eventually a lot of the alumni with nothing left to lose, reported her. But they didn't report her to Director of the program. The director of the program would never have done anything as he was complicit in the money embezzlement to some extent.

I have seen so many tears and even possible suicide attempts in this program and many attribute it to Professor Aly and the way she treated people. At least 4 of my friends expressed concerns for their own mental health over Professor Aly.

Before taking Professor Aly's classes, I had a 3.8 GPA. When I was in the rollercoaster, it went to a 2.8 GPA. Before I blame anyone, I asked myself so many questions and how to improve myself. Also transferring out of the program would have hard and impose a financial burden that would set me back $100,000.

It never mattered to me how hard I studied or how long. Professor Aly told me she never liked me because she and I disagreed on politics. That's very unprofessional and that does not give her the right to mess up my grades and future. Again, I even had to fact checked by exams by Google and by other biology professors at other universities.

What is weird is that as a 20 year old, I had more research experience and papers than her. I had 1 research paper and she had 0. She also spent 7 years in a PhD and still managed to come out with 0 papers. No wonder she was fired.

Since the director was not going to do anything, there was perfect timing when the university appointed a new incoming department chair. This department chair was going to replace the old department chair who was too involved in research and not in the dramas. Once the alumni started to report her to the new department chair, soon the current students from freshman to seniors reported her. Eventually she was fired and everyone had a celebration with cake in the lounge and so much profanity was used to describe her. By then, I was a senior and about to graduate.

My undergrad GPA is still tanked from all the bad grades she gave me. I still have video and audio lecture recordings of her pseudoscience. I still have copies of her poorly graded exams. I submitted them all to the university to thoroughly investigate.",12,2020-04-18 13:45:58,biology

7216,g3rh2g,Andy Kaufman,"I am looking at the video and will make some notes as I go along:

My comments have been made as I watch each segment.

1.  He seems to be suspicious that the earliest suspicions in the disease at the food market was viral, rather than what seems an obvious choice: “food poisoning”.   The implication is that most people would obviously looked to poisoning first and there is something “fishy” about looking for a virus.

a.  I take extreme issue with this implication. First, the symptoms that showed up in these patients were not gastrointestinal like you would expect in food poisoning, they were primarily respiratory.  The first thing any epidemiologist would look for in this case was an infectious agent.  This is what they did, and finding that antibiotics had no curative effect, they concluded, rightfully that this infectious agent had to be a virus.

2.  RT-PCR test.  There seems to be an agenda in his description.  Of course they were only able to test 7 patients.   Getting approval, collecting invasive samples and studying requires a lot of effort.  Actually 7 patients enrolled in these early tests is pretty damn good.

a.  Now, for the results.  He seems to be suspicious of the fact that they focused on these pieces of RNA.  It seems to me that what was reported in the article was the result of a lot of very quick study to get the info out into the public as soon as possible to alert for this new viral disease.   I am certain that they looked at the collected samples for both DNA and RNA, since there are viruses whose genetic material would be of one or the other.  They then looked to see what pieces of each were uniquely present in the diseased patients as opposed to normal, uninfected patients.  If by western blot (a way of screening for pieces of RNA or DNA) they found that all 7 had a particular piece of RNA and that the same piece was not in ordinary, uninfected individuals, that would be extremely strong evidence that the RNA came from the infectious agent.   Regarding purifying virus.  That is not an easy thing to do in general. Growing, cultivating and isolating viruses is a specialty in itself.  Further, if the sample were collected 5 or 6 days after the infection (and we know that with this virus symptoms don’t appear for between 5 and 14 days), there may well have been a strong immune response present which would have made isolating intact virus particles virtually impossible.  

b.  Finally, “the gold standard”. This is a red herring in that it implies that you know what the virus is before you can test for what it is.  Here is what I mean.  He would expect that you would be able to isolate the virus and then examine its genetic material in order to determine whether the RNA you have found near the tissue is, in fact from the virus.  To do this you need to isolate a virus, from among, as he said, the multitude of bacteria and viruses normally in the body; purify it; grow it in sufficient amounts for testing; and then challenge an animal model with it to see if it causes the disease.  Animal models may work or not work, but you really need to challenge humans with the virus to determine if it is the specific agent that causes this disease.  We now know that not everyone gets infected, although we don’t understand why yet; we know that about 80% go symptom free or get mild disease.  So, how will we be sure that we have the right virus before we start looking for the genetic material from that virus?  This is totally backward.  The first thing to do is to find genetic clues that are determinative of the disease, then use those clues to look for larger and larger particles, and eventually viruses themselves.

c.  There can be no “gold standard” without mining for the gold.

d.  Please remember that Coronaviruses in general have been studied for years and years.  There is a multitude of work describing them, their shape, size, the 5 proteins on the surface and the RNA inside.  Characterization of them with SARS1 and MERS and now COVID-19 are demonstrative of the similarities and can identify the specific differences between the various virus species.   The RNA collected (I imagine although I haven’t looked for the specific results) were probably initially compared with the RNA from other coronaviruses, particularly SARS as it had been infectious in China previously and I am sure that the researchers were sensitive to looking out for it.

e.  Regarding the 80% false positives statement.  Two issues with that statement.  

 i.  First, if 80% of the infected patients are asymptomatic, you would EXPECT to see 80% of the positive patients showing no disease!

 ii.  Second, if you have an early, crude test for disease, would you prefer to see 80% false positives or 80% false negatives.  Give me the former every single time.  I would want to be able to identify potential carriers of the virus even if it meant isolating extra people rather than letting a lot of actual carriers back into society to infect more people.

3.  Exosomes.  This discussion here seems to want to make the case that COVID-19 particles are indistinguishable from the normally produced exosomes delivered from cells into the surrounding fluid.  

a.  This is very misleading.  In order for a foreign agent  like a virus to successfully infect and cell, successfully reproduce and successfully leave the host cell it needs to use the cellular machinery.  It does not bring a set of physical tools, organelles or reagents along with it.  Once the RNA is delivered into the cell, the virus needs to hijack the existing materials and organelles and use them in the way they are normally used.  So it is only likely that the viral RNA would be taken up by the same organelles, packaged like normal exosomes, sent to the surface like normal exosomes and released like normal exosomes.  When they bind to a cell they are then incorporated into the cell membrane in the same way as ordinary exosomes.  

b.  The huge difference is that the proteins on the surface of “normal” exosomes and COVID-19 virus particles are DIFFERENT.  The RNA inside is DIFFERENT.  The damage to cells during virus replication versus normal metabolic creation of exosomes is DIFFERENTY.

4.  Chloroquine and Vitamin C.

a.  I have written extensively on these and won’t go into them again.  However, I did notice one comment from him, namely that when he mentioned that the chloroquine is used primarily in this country to treat Lupus and arthritis, he then says “and in my experience it doesn’t work at all in those instances.”  It is quite ridiculous to say that it doesn’t work in diseases in which clinical trial evidentiary results show absolute effects, and in the next sentence to claim that it works against COVID-19 because some doctors say it worked for their patients.  

b.  This claim alone makes the entire presentation questionable.  We are wasting precious time, resources and people on clinical studies of these drugs when other candidates with more potential are sidelined.  It is extremely difficult to assemble a panel of patients for a clinical trial.  It is expensive to get them, keep them and study them.  There is a very finite, and small group of potential individuals to draw from, a very finite group of doctors and laboratories to do the studies, and it is difficult to find a population that has the appropriate characteristics that allow for a good controlled study.  Further, it takes months to determine the results.   Studying tomato juice, vitamin C, vitamin B, Zinc sulfate, hydroxy-chloroquine, azithromycin and the various combinations of them literally PREVENTS the study of nucleotide antagonists like remdesivir and cytokine inhibitors.

At this point I have stopped watching this.

Using a very stupid (and I use the term literally, not judgmentally) analysis based solely on photographic macro-examination of particles, he concludes that viruses are not real but that they are, in fact normal exosomes released by cells in response to a stress event.

This is like looking at pictures of two different pills.  Both are the same size, both are the same shape, both came out of bottles.  Therefore, they must be the same.  Unfortunately one is a vitamin and the other is cyanide.  Take one and you are healthy, take the other and you die.

Based on his conclusions at this point, I conclude that he really IS Andy Kaufman, who has come back from the grave and is performing one of his theatrical parodies.",10,2020-04-18 12:36:39,biology

The topic which I am currently working on is exploring the effect of cultivation conditions on hemeprotein expression by C.reinhardtii. The main goal of my work is to try to apply NN control for maintaining crucial medium component concentrations at appropriate levels during fed-batch cultivations, as to facilitate hemeprotein synthesis. Although, I have none experience working with C.reinhardtii...

Maybe someone here can help me out on a couple of questions, answers to which I was unable to find in the literature:

1) What seems to influence the color change of the C. reinhardtii biomass? I found a couple of pictures  where the algae biomass had different colors (green, yellow and red). Is the color change related to astaxanthin synthesis or something else (hemeprotein accumulation)?

2) What would be the best and easy method for quantifying hemeproteins present in the biomass? In theory multiple sources indicate that the Bradford assay could be used. Although, I suppose that using the Bradford assay it is possible to quantify only total proteins present in the cells (not specifically hemeproteins). 

3) What would be the best bioreactor design for performing fed-batch experiments? In theory, I am planning on using Erlenmeyer flasks for inoculum preparation. For fed-batch cultivations I was planning on using a stirred-tank laboratory bioreactor. But I do not know about the cell resistance to mixing, aeration etc. Maybe airlift is better?

I am the opposite. Slow metabolism, body clock always starts shifting to going to bed later and getting up later if I don’t keep it in check. Could it be that it’s because my body runs slower in general and there’s a link between these? 
Maybe one causes the other?

I have worked there for about 1.5 years without any issues, and I have enjoyed my time there, but it is within these past few weeks that I started to ache all over.  Sometimes my back feels stiff by the end of the shift, joints (especially my wrist and knees) ache more easily, and occasionally get muscle cramps on my sides.  Could it be that the job is starting a take a toll on my body?  I'm in relatively decent shape (I jog a mile almost everyday), weigh 165 lbs at 5'10, but I do eat a lot of fast food.  I figured drinking more water (and eliminating all of the sugary drinks out of the equation), stretching more, and adding more protein (such as non-fried chicken breast, taking protein shakes etc.) to my diet plan would help relieve some of the pain, but it doesn't appear to be helping much.  Like I said, this is something that started to happen within the past few weeks (a couple months ago, I was able to work faster and not feel much pain / soreness at all by the end of the shift).

I'm not sure if this has anything to do with it, but this stuff started to happen after I was treating one of my feet that got badly infected a month ago (suffered from athlete's foot, and the doctor prescribed me the Amoxicillin antibiotic to treat it).  I took a week off work to let it heal, and my foot feels fine now.  However, it was after this point that my body started to ache.  I read that antibiotics can sometimes lead to muscle soreness, so I'm wondering if that could be a cause (last time I took it though was three weeks ago)? :)  I also sometimes wake up with a sore throat, so maybe it could be an infection causing me pain?  When I took that week off, I was mostly laying in bed doing nothing, so it may be that my body hasn't re-adjusted to the physical demands of the job yet?  Maybe I have COVID-19 (I check my body temperature, and I'm consistently at about 97 F)?  I just don't know.  I may visit a doctor, but in the meantime, I'm wondering what you guys suggest I should do.   With this whole coronavirus thing going on right now, it may be hard to make an appointment.

I'm reading a few papers that present the average pairwise relatedness (based on molecular data and pedigree data) and SD for males within animal groups. I'm interested in knowing whether these groups include unrelated males, but only very few studies present their pairwise relatedness data (either on the main text or on the supplementary info). For example, I'm seeing a study that says that they found some males to be highly related within groups, and then present the average pairwise relatedness= 0.30 +- 0.10 -&gt; given these two points of information, I'm very tempted to assume that some male dyads are not related at all, but with averages you never know...

My daughter (First Grade) loves science and ripped through her homework packet. Her teacher said to just enjoy the extra time, but she’s bored as hell. I thought I’d merge science and social studies (they teacher didn’t actually *give* us any social studies) into one unit and look at science holistically: after the experiments are over and the data analyzed, in which ways do humans use that information. I’m going to have biographies of famous scientists, history of great leaps forward in science, map analysis (if applicable) or geography, famous law(s) created because of or based on that science, and the economics of that science which will include a careers section.

The first unit is “Germs”, because it’s applicable. We’re going to mold some food, rub glitter on our hands and touch stuff, paint our hands and see how long it takes for it to wash off, do spit-takes on paper with and without face masks (I made them, don’t worry). All according to the scientific method, so they’re experiments.

But, for the careers sections, I wanted to feature more jobs than “microbiologist.” There are lots of jobs that have to deal with germs, and that’s super-obvious today. But, I don’t necessarily know what their official job title would be. Especially the blended careers of people who work around supporting and advocating for “germ” jobs, like public health social workers and the Director of NIAID. My goal is to hit a range of career fields related to the single topic to demonstrate that science -and understanding science- is foundational for lots of very different jobs, so a single broad job title (microbiologist) rather than dozens of extremely specific ones (research microbiologist, diagnostic microbiologist), would be better. So, here’s what I’ve come up with, and if I’m missing some, or am off-base, or there’s a better job title, would you let me know?

* Microbiologists
* Medical Workers (doctors, nurses, EMTs, lab technicians)
* Janitorial Staff &amp; Biosafety Specialists
* Public Health Workers (would Fauci’s job be broadly this? Or public policy? I can introduce varying levels of authority in government jobs, too.)
* Public Policy Professionals (is Government Science Administrator better?)
* Epidemiologists
* Pharmaceutical Chemists (Scientists?)
* Research Analysts (&amp; Statisticians?)
* Science Writers
* Teachers

Edit: also, easy germ experiments to do with household stuff would be appreciated. I wish I had a microscope, but alas! I’m scouring Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist for a used one... any tips on shopping for a durable, usable microscope are also appreciated.

7353,g2mmgp,Why aren't plants simply biologically tested for their safe edibility at different stages and in different preparation methods?,"So I'm very curious about this as I have a significant interest in foraging / agriculture  and using alternative plants as food plants. Mostly a hobby thing at the moment.

I often read research papers and also look around the world to see what kinds of plants are used for food in ways that we don't use them in the United States. Common examples would be the use of sweet potato leaves as a salad green   / cooked green in Asia and many other third world countries. Cowpeas / Moringa used as cooked greens would be another example.

However, actually finding out information about this is often difficult, and you often even end up with research papers / foraging experts going back and citing books from a hundred years ago or more about how people 'used' to eat them, how they 'used' to prepare them and consume them on a regular basis.

Why do they research in this manner? Why not just biologically analyze plants at different life cycles and determine if there are any chemicals/enzymes that would be harmful if humans consumed them? If so what preparations would need to be done to safely deactivate such chemicals/enzymes for safe consumption?

It just baffles me and it's something I've kept thinking about over the last week and I wish information were more comprehensive because I would love to know for example if one 'could' consume raw cowpea leaves, or if one 'has' to boil/drain the water in order to safely consume them and that it's not simply a traditional cultural practice of 'We've always done it this way, this is all we know, so we do it.'",4,2020-04-16 15:12:16,biology

Heterozygous bA bS people make both   Hb-A and Hb-S and have sickle-cell trait. **Because only one type of b chain is found in any one hemoglobin molecule**, only two types of   hemoglobin molecules are possible—one with two normal b chains, the   other with two mutant b chains.

The theory of the study is that these results suggest oxidative stress which can cause cancer.

Study:

Introduction: The present study aimed to assess the levels of salivary enzymes, protein and oxidant-antioxidant system in young college-going cell phone users.

Materials and Methods: The cell users (students) were categorized in to two groups – less mobile users and high mobile users, based on the duration and frequency of cell use. Unstimulated whole saliva samples of the volunteers were analysed for amylase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehdye (MDA) and glutathione (GSH).

Results: High mobile users had significantly higher levels of amylase (p = 0.001), LDH (p = 0.002) and MDA (p = 0.002) in saliva, when compared to less mobile users. The marginal decrease in salivary total proteins, GSH and flow rate were statistically not significant (p &gt;0.05).

Conclusion: Significant changes in salivary enzymes and MDA suggest adverse effect of high use of cell phones on cell health.

7605,g0bxnd,COVID19 Immunity,"I'm largely ignorant of biology, so I apologize in advance for not knowing the correct terms to use for this question.

I realize there's a lot we don't know about the virus, but my understanding is that if we're exposed to COVID19 and recover (or were asymptomatic) that we would have developed T-Cells and theoretically that would make us immune to getting infected again, at least theoretically until our body breaks down the T-cells.

My question is - if we fall into this category, wouldn't we want to have occasional exposure to keep those T-cells active and keep our immunity? 

(The reason I'm asking this question is because your immune system can be up or down depending on sleep, stress, nutrition, sleep, etc so it seems that just because you survive it the first time doesn't mean you would the second.)",3,2020-04-12 23:32:02,biology

&amp;#x200B;

I had looked into a research paper on pro/anti-angiogenic factors and the pictures showing the effects on the tissue confused me.

For example picture A showed a great deal of increase in blood vessels after exposure to pro-angiogenic factors while picture B (im not sure if thats the same tissue or another tissue) showed a strongly reduced number of blood vessels. But did those pictures show the same sample tissue?

If yes, then anti-angiogenic factors do indeed break down blood vessels that had previously been formed..

7610,g0a5ze,Undergraduate genetics is flippin hard. How was your experience?,"A little bit of a background. I am currently taking some post- baccalaureate biology courses at a local university. One of these courses is a 4 credit genetics course.I majored in geography/environmental science in undergrad and have done several seasons of biological field work since graduating, and am planning to go to grad school for wildlife/conservation bio. In one of my interviews for a funded masters position, I was told I am at a deficiency in courses and need to take genetics (and a few others) in order to qualify for a funded masters position (although the professor seemed enthusiastic about our shared research interests). 

Anyway, genetics is pretty brutal for me. Lecture isn't too bad, I got a 90% on our first exam which I was immensely proud of and had been staying afloat on all of the homework. Now that we're online, things aren't going as smoothly but still not too bad. However, lab is a killer. This was (before covid) my very first time doing any sort of biological lab work. I tanked our lab midterm. It's very discouraging, although I do pretty well on the lab reports themselves. Now with the pandemic/virtual coursework, I am having even more difficulty juggling my time. I definitely feel like I threw myself into the deep end, as I have no prior biology coursework and this is probably the hardest class I have ever taken.

However, it seems like genetics is often considered a 'hell class', frequently spoken of in the same breath as O chem. How is/was your experience in genetics? This probably sounds like I'm more concerned than I really am, I'm very confident I can pull a solid B, I was just really caught off guard by how difficult it is.

However, [it has been noticed](https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/mcpheem/private-docs/cv-documents/McPhee%202003%20BC.pdf) that generations of captive breeding reduces the pressures of natural selection, allowing for a wider deviance from the instinctual behaviors that strictly existed in the previous wild-caught generations. Because of this, many reintroduced captive bred species are not very successful in their natural habitats.

These findings call for change in animal conservation.

7627,g06659,I am looking for the best ear structure animation," 

Hello!  
I am working on scientific research which is related to anatomic and physiological aspects of ear structure. Research includes specific informations about hearing and phenomenons occurring in ear.

Until now, I have been struggling with structure and mechanisms of Basement Membrane.

I have found animation which is presenting cochlear, very simplified Basement Membrane and wave propagation:

[Cochlear animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyenMluFaUw)

Animation concludes view of cochlear which opens up and then we can behold out simplified Basement Membrane and waves propagating through it. At the end of this animation we also can see response of the membrane to stimulation with overtone which is awesome, but I want to find animation which illustrates it better.

In this animation I can notice two main differences in relation to our real ear structure:

Firstly, waves propagate crosswise across the entire width. In fact, we can not notice vibrations on the edges, because they are connected with bones - waves propagate on the center of Basement Membrane.  
Secondly, the dimensions of that membrane are irregular.

Moreover I have found other animations:  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwwcSLb3eNo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwwcSLb3eNo)

That animation presents enlarged Organ of Corti and Basement Membrane. It is also very interesting, but contains one contradiction - generated stimulus gets in afferent cortex, but do not get into efferent fiber.

Still others animations:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZmlUvHomrA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZmlUvHomrA)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-kty9Ltqg4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-kty9Ltqg4)

As you can see, on the Internet I can find a lot animations which illustrates structure of the ear but some of them are simplified (but really great). I do really want to find animations which presenting that phenomenons and structure without simplifications and which are more realistic than animations presented above.

Does anybody have animations which better illustrate ear structure?

So are the RELPs the mutated palindromic repeats or are they just whole fragments of DNA from one cut fragment to the other?

My (very rudimentary) understanding of biology is that there is basically a whole ecosystem of gut bacteria, eyelash mites, various parasites and bacteria and viruses, that live in and on our bodies.

With social distancing, we’re trying to control one virus, but will separating ourselves so much affect the rest of our microbes?

Will reduced contact change our gut bacteria?

Will the flu still mutate before next season and need a new shot if it’s not spreading as much? Will we still be able to predict what strains will be common if we’re currently getting less data than usual?

Is it true there are tiny mites in my eyelashes? Do my eyelash mites bang my Tinder date’s eyelash mites when I bang my Tinder date (assuming our faces touch)? And, if so, will my mites become inbred?

Yet I don't feel any spark towards a scientific career, nor do I want to be a doctor/medical nurse dealing directly with patients. Getting a PhD would be fine with me, but not more.

Why am I thinking of a vocational degree? In my first year of High School, I once shadowed a Biomedical lab technician and it absolutely fascinated me, and one other time I shadowed a Pathologist who analyzed samples in a hospital, which was also a pretty darn interesting experience. Even as I'm now enjoying my university courses, I keep thinking of coming back just to get that vocational degree. There are also options to become a Dental Assistant or Nurse / Dental Technician / Radiology Assistant, which are also rather interesting to me. Moreover, I'm eligible for state-funded studies in my country thanks to my HS grades.

I'd also like to get a teaching degree but Id be disappointed if I would only be able to teach Biology, and not Chemistry...

So it looks like the best water soluble one is 1-propanol. The longer chain ones appear to be more potent up to hexanol, but they are not very soluble in water. I wonder if they are so potent though that the amount needed could still be dissolved in water. Or could an ethanol/water solution be used to force more of a higher chain alcohol into solution.

7799,fyb2v4,Isn't it impossible for oral antibiotics to permanently cure severe acne?,"After topical antibiotics and/or retinoid and/or benzoyl peroxide, dermatologists commonly prescribe oral antibiotics before isotretinoin. But why? Here are my premises for why oral antibiotics can't permanently cure acne.  

1. Presume that the patient dutifully consumes the [full prescribed course of antibiotics](https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/48724/4466).

1. Antibiotics may reduce the number of, but can't kill to the last drop, bacterium, like *Cutibacterium acnes*.

2. Acne sufferers don't usually live in a sterile environment, and *C. acnes* may be floating in the air or lying on surfaces. Even if antibiotics kill every single bacterium of *C. acnes* this time, it'll probably colonize you again. Unlike most pathogens targeted by antibiotics, *C. acnes* is

&gt; largely [commensal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism ""Commensalism"") and part of the [skin flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora ""Skin flora"") present on most healthy adult humans' skin.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutibacterium_acnes#cite_note-8) It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents. It lives, among other things, primarily on [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid ""Fatty acid"") in [sebum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebum ""Sebum"") secreted by sebaceous glands in the [follicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle ""Hair follicle""). It may also be found throughout the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract ""Gastrointestinal tract"").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutibacterium_acnes#cite_note-expert-reviews2003-9)

3. Oral antibiotics mustn't be consumed forever.

3. After antibiotics kill most of the *C. acnes* and the patient stops taking the antibiotic, the remaining *C. acnes* (perhaps now resistant to that antibiotic) will proliferate to its formerly high concentration, and cause acne again. 

My argument befits  the comments beneath.

7823,fy1e18,AP Biology.. HELP,"You are a researcher working on a treatment for Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder that causes accelerated aging in children. Children with progeria generally appear healthy at birth but soon start growing more slowly than other children and lose their hair. Additional symptoms include stiffness of joints, heart problems, and stroke. These children typically die of heart disease at an average age of 13 years. Progeria is caused by a mutation in a single gene, called lamin A. Scientists have identified over 1,400 mutations in the lamin A gene that result in changes in transcription, RNA splicing, and/or protein production. Lamin A codes for a protein required for the structural support of the nuclear envelope in cells. Without a functional protein, the nuclear envelope becomes unstable, eventually damaging the nucleus and causing cells to die. Propose a genetic medicine strategy you could develop to treat patients with progeria. Describe which step in gene expression you might target and why you would target that step, the intervention tool you would use, and explain how this strategy would treat the disease?????",2,2020-04-09 16:46:46,biology

7840,fxutu6,Why COVID-19 is deadly,"So, according to an article I read, the reason COVID-19 is deadly is not because of its effects on the lungs. 

One of the main symptoms distinguishing COViD from the flu is shortness of breath, or dyspnea. 

Evidence is showing COVID displaces the iron ions in hemoglobin in the blood. 

Without iron, oxygen cannot be bound. Without oxygen binding, it is not transported to the cells. 

That is why O2 saturation levels are also low; oxygen isn’t getting to the cells (this is called hypoxia) 

Prolonged hypoxia leads to organ failure, and thus death. 

The body compensates for hypoxia in a few ways. 

In one response, the hormone erythropoietin is released, which stimulates the production of red blood cells from bone marrow. (This leads to increased hematocrit level). The idea is to increase the oxygen carrying capacity in the blood. 

Also, most notably, the respiratory rate is increased. The idea is to increase the amount of oxygen available to bind. This increase in RR manifests as shortness of breath. Think about trying to catch your breath after an intense exercise. You want to take a deep breath and get as much air as you can, but your breathing rate is too fast to do it comfortably. This is what is essentially happening during rest.

**Why is Hydroxychloroquine showing promise?**

Hydroxycloroquine is traditionally used as an anti-malarial. 

Malaria is a parasite that destroys red blood cells. (Sickle fell anemia confers immunity to malaria because the parasite cannot interact with the misshapen red blood cell). 

HQC prevents the malarial parasite from interacting with healthy red blood cells. 

It also seems to prevent SARS-CoV-2 from interacting with the heme groups, and thus to prevents it from displacing iron. 

No iron displacement; no hypoxia. 

This is also why ventilators have not been effective in treating the virus. 

The major “punch” of the virus doesn’t hit the lungs; it hits the blood.

I hadn't been consistently looking for a job, or properly, during the last few months I've been off school. But a recruiter has been helping me lately with interviews and I've had my first 2 this week. I have been stressing out about finding a job and whether I'm 'skilled' enough to even find a job and get into the medical industry. On top of that there's the parental and cultural pressure (and pressure on myself to move out because I'm annoyed living at home, even though things are paid for me and all that).

For the last 2 weeks its taken a little bit of a toll on me and now that I'm relaxing in bed (finally) thinking about things, I'm thinking if I should just rest, work on myself (my mental health, confidence), my passions, learn new ones and just take advantage of this time I have ""off"", even though I have been having ""time off"", because I feel like I'll never get this sort of time again where literally nothing is expected. Everyone seems to be all over the place (But since healthcare and medical are in need right now..).

I don't have professional industry experience so I'm eager to at least get some experience and get my foot in the door. And it feels like there's less competition now. Like I'm excited for these new opportunities (hell in an interview I had today, the people said they liked me), but would it be better to just wait till everything is okay again? I want to work on myself so bad and I'm scared if I end up taking a job then I won't be able to do that as much and working on myself means alot to me.

7887,fxco07,No adaptation for years: What is going on?,"TLDR: What is this muscular condition or what has happened to the muscle?

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

28 years old. Male.

Patellar tendinopathy at 16.

Lots of rest and physical inactivity since 18, except for moderate walking.

Sleep + nutrition have been on point.

Been dealing with depression last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

The Problem:

Certain movements and exercises cause light shaking or trembling in my quads, and also cause a strange feeling of weakness or fatigue upon completion. This is not your typical ""muscle soreness"".

&amp;#x200B;

The Symptoms:

Trembling and shaking can occur during the movement. If I ignore these signals and power through a movement, I'll typically feel immediately weak after the set. Like my legs are lethargic or sluggish, which can persist into the next day. All of these feelings are distinct and aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

Most of the examples I can think of involve my quads:

&amp;#x200B;

    Walking down stairs or downhill (not even that steep)
    
    Squats, nearly any variation with no extra weight
    
    Climbing
    
    Longboarding (example below)

&amp;#x200B;

One Example:

Longboarding. I can stand upright on the board, but as soon as I bend my knees, even a slight bend, I'll typically start trembling. Not vigorously, but lightly. And if I hold the position even longer? This weird weakness begins to come on. It leaves me feeling weak, lethargic, with even more trembling if I try to preform the movement again. The next day I'll usually feel the same weakness, especially if I've ""overdone"" it, which literally doesn't take much at all. Doesn't take hitting the burn or fatiguing, just spending a bit of time in this trembling or weak state.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is certain emotional states, such as if I'm in a fight or flight situation. The ""energy"" will leave my legs, and I'll begin feeling that same weak/powerless feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Counter Examples:

    Walking (flat ground)
    
    Light dancing
    
    Soccer ball keepups
    
    Lower intensity cycling 
    
    Movements that ""feel good""
    
    Being in the zone (example below)

&amp;#x200B;

One time I was cheering and motivating my basketball team. I was so fired up and passionate, going from pacing back and forth, to squatting, and holding a semi-squat position, on and off for the whole game. After the game, I nearly immediately felt soreness in one of my quads. But it felt great. Today, if I tried to recreate that outcome, I would just hit weakness and trembling before achieving that soreness.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example was a few years ago when I walked for 20 kilometers a day, for 3 days straight. My quads felt pretty amazing after that whole experience, but I sustained achilles tendinopathy (which I'm still recovering from).

&amp;#x200B;

The Outcome:

Much of the training my quads get exposed to is maladaptive. A negative feedback loop.

The number of restrictions on intensity, volume, and frequency give me so little to work with.

I've seen no progression for years. Most likely due to lack of consistency with the right approach, which has been really tricky to find.

Even if I rest a few days, my body doesn't positively adapt. I won't get stronger, and my future capacity will decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have Turner Syndrome (TS), and it is a genetic disorder that only affects girls.

Girls usually have 2 X chromosomes, one from her biological mom and one from her biological dad. Turner Syndrome is when one X chromosome is fully or partially missing (partially missing is mosaic TS, which is what I have)

TS's biggest symptoms are short stature and delayed or no puberty. Of course there are other symptoms, but those are the two biggest ones. These symptoms are treated with hormonal therapy, so I took human growth hormone when I was younger, and I am currently taken estrogen and progesterone. (I'm almost 18)

Feel free to ask about my many doctors (I have several) or how it impacts my life, it's up to you! I'll try to answer as honestly as I can.

SCNT has a higher success rate than iSCNT, and within iSCNT, as the genetics of the donor + recipient get further apart, the success rate gets lower.

I've read that some reasons for this lower success rate could be [heteroplasmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroplasmy) or [mtDNA incompatibilities](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20735895/) within the iSCNT embryo.

Are there other differences to cellular structure or contents that would make very different species less likely to have a successful iSCNT?

7941,fwsbzb,Question about fuel in mitochondria.,"Oxygen is an oxidizer.  At the right temperature it steals electrons from whatever it is oxidizing, and those electrons release energy during transfer.

In our cells, after electrons leave our fuel, it is traveling through the mitochondria. Stopping at different proteins to release bits of energy at each stop, all for that energy to collect at another protein to combine it with ADP to create ATP.  After the electrons final protein stop it meets up with the oxygen to be converted into carbon dioxide and water.

Question time
Is it the oxygen molecule at the end responsible for pulling the electrons out of the fuel initially to travel along the chain of different proteins? If not, what's causing the electrons to escape the molecules it's initially from?

After the electrons leave the fuel, does the fuel then head over to the oxygen to partake in the chemical minipulation causing the creation of carbon dioxide? I'd imagine yes because carbon dioxide is the carbon with two oxygen atoms. So it would need too, right? Or am I wrong?

Is there a better fitting word for fuel in my context?",0,2020-04-07 15:45:16,biology

So Plant seeds, or seeds in general, are, at the end of the day, composed of complex chemical structures; and their growth, complex chemical reactions. My question is: Is it possible, or can we even think about, creating a seed, a bio-engineered seed, which I can possibly throw on the ground, and somehow program this seed to grow into whatever type of plant I want? Within a couple days even (a fastened growth time?) Maybe one day we can all grow an apple tree in a week's time in our backyards :).

In my field, I work with a lot of scientists, mainly geologists. I initially went to school for geology and I have the supporting classes that most physical science majors require (two semesters of chem and calculus). I stopped going when I found my way into a very well paying job overseeing a handful of people. It has been four years and I have found that it is time to do something else, and I know that I don't want to go down the geology route for a number of reasons I won't get into. I have always been a scientist at heart, and I would like to be a real one now.

One of the universities near me offers a BS in molecular biosciences, which I feel would be a good starting point to get into a master's program. I have crossed paths with enough biologists over the years to know that employment opportunities vary greatly, based on specialty. Unfortunately, we are all forced to worship the almighty dollar in some capacity, and I want to make sure I go down a specific path that is highly employable, especially considering tuition rates.

My questions are:

1. How employable is a molecular biology master's degree?
2. Is there some specialty within this that is especially desirable in the private sector?
3. How hard is it to start fresh in this field at the age I would be once I am done (maybe 33 or 34)?",2,2020-04-05 13:24:47,biology

Obviously this is an extremely unrealistic example, but would there ever be a moment when the descendants of one species might have a different classification than its predecessors? Would this still be considered a plant, or would it be an animal? maybe something else entirely?

I've never studied any biology so I don't really know what I'm talking about. I'm trying to solidify the differences between clades and taxonomy in my head, and hopefully this might clear some things up.",2,2020-04-05 10:29:27,biology

* Are germ cells omnipotent? They must be b/c they give rise to a whole new organism.
* If germ cells are omnipotent, why are they ""a committed lineage derived from pluripotent stem cells""? If they are ""committed"" then how can they be omnipotent?
* Or is this all just a different way to say ""germ cells are just stem cells that are set aside to give rise to another organism later"".
* And if the previous is true, why does a germ cell need it's sexual complement to form a viable embryo?
* By that I mean: why can't germ cells just make a clone of the original organism?

I realize I may be asking a few unanswerable questions along the lines of ""why did evolution choose\* to do this instead of this? (\*I know evolution doesn't choose). But really I'm just trying to get to the fundamentals of development.

Study:


Background:
The possibility of side effects associated with the electromagnetic waves emitted from mobile phones is a controversial issue. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone use on parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulin A, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase and C-reactive protein.
Methods:
Stimulated salivary samples were collected simultaneously from both parotid glands of 86 healthy volunteers. Salivary flow rate and salivary concentrations of proteins, amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin A, were measured. Data were analysed using t-tests and one-way analyses of variance.
Results:
Salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein were significantly higher on the right side compared to the left in those that predominantly held mobile phones on the right side. In addition, there was a decrease in concentrations of amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and peroxidase.
Conclusion:
The side of dominant mobile phone use was associated with differences in salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations, in right-dominant users. Although mobile phone use influenced salivary composition, the relationship was not significant.",2,2020-04-05 06:03:35,biology

8115,fv6wgr,In need of some advice for biophysics research in cardiology or immunology?,"Hi all, I am trying to get some feedback on whether I should do cardiothoracic surgery or immunology with a focus on virology?

Ultimately my goal is MD/PhD. Currently I will be doing my PhD in the Fall, without the MD part. I have not yet applied to medical school. I was hoping to do that in my 3rd year PhD studies. I find video like this cool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaw16xE5ooM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaw16xE5ooM) and that's what would draw me into virology after my PhD.

Most likely my PhD rotations will be in virology, microbiology, or immunology depending on whether the uni labs open space. Other available spaces include many neurology labs or oncology, however I do not have a strong interest in those. My interest can change if those are the only labs available and I end up spending a great deal there and learn a lot and contribute to many wet lab experiments. Since my undergrad research was in biophysics of oncology, I don't know why I am not as heavily invested in oncology. If by some miracle, a professor at my uni writes back, then maybe I will be involved in oncovirus research.

It may be hard to find a cardio research lab. I did reach out to cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeons to shadow and volunteer. I find video like this cool: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSCbdqGjAZ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSCbdqGjAZ0)

I have not reached out to immunologist/virologist for shadowing as I think I can just work in the research lab.

My background:

Bachelors in Biology with a thesis in Biophysics and Bioengineering of Cancer cells. I ended up with 1 published paper. I did go to an undergrad engineering school, but they didn't have bioengineering as an bachelors. I still had to take a lot of math and physics.

My weakness from undergrad is my chemistry skills. Even though I had 9 chemistry classes (2 of which were grad level), I still do not like theoretical or quantum or even computational chemistry. I did enjoy thermodynamics and pchem. I could work in a chemistry lab setting, but I'm not good in a chemistry lecture or exam. I would feel like that can inhibit any virology setting since I would have to work at labs and do QCs and analytics.

Masters in Math since I thought I wanted to do data science in healthcare. Or if that didn't work out, then I would have done biophysics. So far my math skills are not that great. I know some computer programming, but not enough for data mining. My stats and probability are okay and definitely the highlight of my masters and undergrad. I did a lot of probability distributions, calculations, and predictions in data analysis. I did not use that many Markov or Stochastic models, but I am still building my experience.

My weakness in math would have been in topology and real analysis. My vector calculus is also subpar, and I still have difficulty with Stoke's Equations and vector fields, even though I used a lot of DiffQs in my undergrad engineering school. Since my topology and vector calculus is bad, I don't think I can do modeling or biophysical analysis of cardiovascular systems.

I would like to do more research into fluid mechanics and study Navier Stokes in the circulatory system, but like I mentioned, I would need to get better in vector calculus.

&amp;#x200B;

My current biology classes include: genetics, biochem, organic chem, anatomy, physiology, and cellular biology

For the fall of my PhD, I will be taking advanced biochem and immunology. I have not taken oncology classes, but I have work experience in an oncology lab and I have published a paper in it.

8160,fuvj86,Death instinct,"Hello everyone! 
I’m here because I would appreciate a little help from you guys. I have a story to tell, and I would love to hear everyone’s opinion about it. 
In the January, I started feeling something that I called “instinct”. I felt like something will happen to me in the *near* future. I basically started feeling more appreciative of life and time in general, considering that I started feeling that my death might be near. 
I did not feel stressed out about it, anxious or nervous. 
Nothing like that.
Few times, when I was with my boyfriend I would tell him that I have a weird feeling that something dangerous will happen to me soon and that I might even die, and that I just want us to spend time together and use it to do things that we always wanted to do but kept it for later. 
He would just tell me to stop imagining things and to stop being delusional. I have experienced some mental issues in my life, but that was completely different than this feeling. 
It wasn’t anything like this.
But, since I noticed that it annoyed him a bit, I kept it for myself. I decided not to mention it again.
I was living my life pretty much normally. But each time when I would lay in bad during day and decide to take a nap, it was as if something was just telling me: “Are you crazy! Time is so precious and limited and you will spend it by taking naps?”
I would feel bad, I would get up and do something I enjoyed. 
I would take a book, I would go for a hike, I would turn on some music and dance, I would go out with friends,  I would enroll courses, I would learn new things and skills.
Then came February. I started experiencing mild pain. I went to a doctor who told me it was nothing, regardless of blood tests showing some alarming things. But I went home and moved on with my life as usual.
Each day my pain was getting significally worse. By the 5th day (from the first day when I started experiencing pain) my pain was getting unbearable. I would scream, I would cry, I would be unable to move, unable to get out of bed by myself. 
I ended up in ER, having pulmonary embolism and pleuropneumonia. It got very severe and complicated and I was basically on deathbed. I could have died any second. I was in a hospital for a while. I had diapers and couldn’t even go to the bathroom that was 3 steps away. 
I stayed there for some time, but then coronavirus started getting a bit out of control. My doctor decided to release me home because even catching a cold in the hospital would kill me immediately, barely getting coronavirus. 
So I started treating myself from home. ( I think Im getting better yay ).
However, Im very intrigued by that “instinct” of mine..I wonder what it was exactly. I want to know what would be scientific explanation, I want to know what would be religious explanation, I want to know what would be astrological or literally whatever explanation there might exist 😅",5,2020-04-04 10:26:33,biology

8175,fur6hd,Different Genetic Similarity percentage between different cousin species for macroevolution?,"Alright so I've heard an argument online against macroevolution (I know it's guaranteed that it happened, but I was curious about this) that claims that since different pairs of two cousin species have different genetic similarity percentages, this means microevolutions don't necessarily add up to make macroevolution (?). Here's the argument:

**1 - Humans and Chimps are cousins, as well as two coelacanth species.**

**2 - Humans and Chimps have a genetic difference of 1.3%, while two coelacanths have a genetic difference of 1.23%**

**3 - This therefore means that microevolutions don't lead to a macroevolution (neccesarily) because coelacanths had more (?) microevolutions but macroevolution happened later?**

I don't fully understand this argument, and I'm not qualified in this field so I've had some questions for biologists:

1 - Does macroevolution even happen at a certain point when the genetic differences reach a specific value? If not, is it random?

2 - How does this argument even hold (if it does)? Don't different species have different genes that all vary if there's a specific point? Can anyone explain this simply?

The reason I'm asking these is because I originally asked it in another subreddit, and someone qualified told me that this was a real issue that biologists talked about, and it was a problem about how ""species"" and ""genuses"" were defined in terms of humans. Either way I hope you guys can give me a general understanding of this topic as I found it worth to learn for myself.

Will the sperm behave in it’s normal behavior and carry on into the female cervix and into the ovaries seeking the egg?

If the forging sperm and forging egg interact does the sperm get inside the egg and due to incapability’s the egg dies? Or this process does not happen in the first place?

After being turned off of biology in high school, I am now coming back to it as an adult. I'm looking primarily for a motivating experience. For introductory courses, I think focusing on motivation - rather than foundations of the discipline - will actually cause more learning in the long-run, because students will want to keep learning.

I began the [Khan Academy lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology) and still plan to go through them. I was expecting to be inspired by cool information about animals in the wild, the promise of understanding my own health, a take on cutting edge genetic engineering, etc. After such experiences I may want to develop a deeper understanding of those phenomena by studying more biology. Instead, I am pure *rote memorizing* properties of electrons, the London Dispersion Force, and a zillion different parts of the cell.

I can do all that shit. Even weird stuff you wouldnt expect, my tongue is capable of I think every trick, rolling, 3 leafed clover, upsidedown, I can even do this thing where I roll my tongue, then push my lower tongue up into the roof of my mouth and bend my lower tongue so the tip of my tongue is at the bottom of my gums in front of my teeth, the finished product my tongue is rolled and vertical up against my lips, then I open my mouth which creates an image of a penis coming out of my mouth, which is actually very disturbing to look at. I can also swallow my tongue, and I can feel it move and exist in my throat and move it around in my throat, which I couldnt always do (dont know if that one is special), anyway enough about tongues.

\-----&gt;hears where I stop rambling about tongue tricks: My joints are very mobile, well most, not all. Oddly my back is not flexible (I have bad posture, is there a connection there?). So back to me as a kid (this has a point) I could do all the cool stuff, I can move my hands like waves or a snake put together like im praying, but my issue and main reason why im here is, my shoulder and collar bone. I would pop my shoulder out of the socket as a bit for my friends, this was from when I realized i could do it (like 6th grade), to i think 10th? i didnt do it a lot when I got older, i still do it from time to time because its very very loud; it makes a loud popping noise that scare people lol, but it hurts to do it, so i wont be doing it anymore. My collar bone is also fucked from doing this. My shoulder is fine from day to day life, sometimes itll pop out, a little then i have to push it back it but it doesnt hurt. My collar bone however, is a bitch. I think from doing that over, and over, I knocked my collar bone around, cause it feels like its scraping against maybe my highest rib? it feels slightly below the collar bone, and about a half inch deep in me. SO the question is can i fix this? Ive gone to a chiropractor when I was younger, not much and this hadn't started yet ( I went because of my chest being very convex causing my right rib cage to slightly extend past my left causing a little bump at the bottom of my sternum, its nbd). Tips for resources where i can find info on how to prevent this for the future, or maybe exercises made to improve joint help? Or just any insight at all would be nice if anyone is familiar with it, or has it. Another thing is my joints pop out a lot which worries me, but also what i would do as a kid was I would force my left should out of the socket poking out in front of me, however it would still hurt a little as a kid and these daily pop outs are a lot less violent and dont hurt. Should I be worried about them? Or will they not get worse? final thought for those astute of you, I do not have Ehlers Danlos Syndrom, I was tested, and tested for 4 out of the 5 necessary, out of a total of 9.

I don't know why, but I've been feeling pretty bad about killing bugs lately. When they are in the house, I feel like I have to kill them, because I live with my parents and I need to keep the house clean. I can't always let them outside either. This winter, we had a ton of stinkbugs in our house, and they are an invasive species so its better that I kill them. But they are so docile I feel bad about it. Just now, I found a big spider in the basement (a wolf spider, I think?) and I went and smashed with a wad of toilet paper. It didn't even move when I got close to it. I know it's an instinctual thing for a creatures to freeze up to not be seen, but I felt bad that it didn't even put up a fight. And then I flushed it down the toilet, and I feel like it's so disrespectful to flush bugs down the toilet because sometimes they are still alive. Anyway, I then got mad at my myself because it could of killed other bugs down in the basement. My parents never come down to the basement anyway, I could let it live and mind its own business, but I had to go and kill it. I looked over at the spot where I found and had the tingling feeling of guilt and sadness. Like it could be over there right now living its life if I hadn't killed it. I felt the same sadness with this stinkbugs too only the spider was bigger so I feel even worse. I should I be feeling this guilty about killing insects in my house?

Contrary to what some people may think I am in favour of, I am not advocating that we stop using terms like ""female"" and ""male"" to refer to certain bodies per se, but that we accept the biological fact of natural, biological diversity in the human species and that these terms are not always useful, useable because of the body and or it's function in question, or accurate.

We have excellent, inclusive alternatives to ""female condom"" like ""vaginal condom"" or ""internal condom"" and, likewise, we have superior terminology for things like ""male condom"" such as ""penile condom"" or ""external condom"".

I can assist with all regulatory compliance such as IRBs and informed consent. The labs have appropriate BSLs and BBP training.

The first step in performing an antibody stain is to obtain and antibody that will bind specifically to gene product of interest.  To do this the gene, or a small portion of it, is cloned into a vector, transformed into a host cell (usually a bacterium), and then artificially expressed.  The protein that the gene codes for is then harvested, purified, and concentrated. Once the gene product is prepared we take advantage of the ability of the mammalian immune system's ability to produce specific antibodies to nearly any foreign protein.

This is essentially what an antibody stain is.

**Evidence for Efficient Proteolytic Processing of SARS-2-S**  
The goal of our study was to obtain insights into how SARS-2-S facilitates viral entry into target cells and how this process can be blocked. For this, we first asked whether SARS-2-S is robustly expressed in a human cell line, 293T, commonly used for experimentation because of its high transfectability. Moreover, we analyzed whether there is evidence for proteolytic processing of the S protein because certain coronavirus S proteins are cleaved by host cell proteases at the S1/S2 cleavage site in infected cells (Figure 1A). Immunoblot analysis of 293T cells expressing SARS-2-S protein with a C-terminal antigenic tag re- vealed a band with a molecular weight expected for unpro- cessed S protein (S0) (Figure 1B). A band with a size expected for the S2 subunit of the S protein was also observed in cells and, more prominently, in vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) particles bearing SARS-2-S (Figure 1B). In contrast, an S2 signal was largely absent in cells and particles expressing SARS-S (Figure 1B), as previously documented (Glowacka et al., 2011; Hofmann et al., 2004b). These results suggest efficient proteolytic processing of SARS-2-S in human cells.",0,2020-04-02 13:19:20,biology

I've done quite a bit of research and I think I want to go in the direction of a Wildlife Biologist, Fisheries Biologist, Environmental Biologist. . .I know it's a wide spectrum. 

The issue I'm having is that in college, my professors told me to go as broad as I can with classes (I think more to prepare me for graduate school) but now I'm finding I'm too broad, and have no knowledge in a specific area. So when jobs are looking for 8 credits of wildlife and fisheries and 12 credits in ecology, I just don't have it. 

I wanted to get a masters, but I decided I would be better off getting my feet wet to see if the masters would even help me, and to make sure that I don't go to school 2-3 more years only to find out it hasn't helped me get a job.

Questions:

1. Should I just take a few extra supplemental classes (i.e. GIS, wildlife management, zoology, conservation ecology)?
   1. Should I just decide on adding an associates in Wildlife and Fisheries? or Wildlife management?
   2. If I'm going to take classes, should I just go for a masters? or could a masters potentially make me ""overqualified""/ not really help me find a job anymore than I am now?
2. How can I make my resume more appealing to even get an initial technician job?

I'm actually a civil engineering student so I am way out of my comfort zone here, but my environmental engineering class, my professor is asking us to calculate the downwind concentration of a cough at a distance of 6 feet using an equation that models the dispersion of a smokestack. I don't necessarily believe that this man is fit to teach this course, but that is neither here nor there, and frankly I don't care how well this equation models coughs in comparison to a smoke stack; this is busy work, but a quiz nonetheless.

The equation uses the standard deviation of particle size, but I can't find any data on the standard deviation of cough droplets. I was able to find that 1 droplet is about .05mL, and at a cough average of 3,000 droplets you could calculate the volume, and then mass of the droplets/cough which is what I need.

Does data on the standard deviation of cough droplets exist? If not, would someone be able to give insight to the general magnitude I would use for this variable in my equation? like 10\^-1, etc...

The point of the use of this equation is to prove social distancing works, which would mean the function outputs 0g/cm\^3 at a distance of 6 feet. 

Thanks for any insight in advance.",0,2020-04-01 12:42:58,biology
8336,ft4epz,Please critique my draft for a DIY SARS-CoV-2 testing facility so that I can offer these tests for free to those people in need,"Hello everyone!

I hope your quarantines are going well.

A little disclaimer before I move on: I am not a biologist. I am a Business major. My knowledge of biology is equivalent to that of an earlier high school student (11th grade). However, I have tried my absolute best to research about SARS-CoV-2 and the current methodologies that are in place for testing of the virus.

Due to lack of facilities in my area with regards to get a test done for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, I have been inspired to design a DIY testing facility to perform SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with a cost-effective approach in mind. RT-LAMP technique will be the basis of this test as my area has extremely limited resources (I am based in a developing country) and hence cannot perform qRT-PCR. You may argue that I use a method to test for IgM &amp; IgG antibodies. But as far as I know, the disadvantage to this method is that it cannot be used as the ultimate basis of establishing whether one has the virus or not, but rather only tests for the antibodies that are not unique towards tackling SARS-CoV-2.

Once I am able to get this project up and running, I will provide free diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to those people who are not able to get a test or who cannot afford the price of the test.

So, the purpose of this post is to kindly get some invaluable feedback about my draft for performing SARS-CoV-2 testing with a very cost-effective approach. I would greatly appreciate it if any of you can provide some insight to this. As I mentioned earlier, I am not a biologist. So when I get to the execution stage of this plan, your feedback would really help me to minimize any friction caused by my lack of knowledge in this subject. It would also help us all in our efforts to flatten the curve globally.

Here is how I intend to carry out this plan:

Step 1 - Collect sample from the patient. In order to do this, I plan to employ a small group of people and get them trained to carry out nasopharyngeal swabs on patients. I am aware that currently nasopharyngeal swab kits are limited so what can I do about this? Is there any alternative to this? Because I cannot afford the expensive kits, and even if I were able to afford them, I would have to wait for them to arrive for a very long time. As we all know, in this pandemic time is not on our side. So do you have any suggestions about this? For e.g. can a nasal wash be used instead of a nasopharyngeal swab?

Step 2 - Centrifuge the patient sample by using a paperfuge (https://www.wired.com/2017/01/paperfuge-20-cent-device-transform-health-care/) to get the supernatant. Then, a ""QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit” will be used to extract the virus’s RNA.

Step 3 - Perform RT-LAMP on the extracted RNA. For this step to take place, in a vial I will pipette in reverse transcriptase, some number of primers (these will be designed with the help of someone who specialises in molecular biology) and some sort of color agent (I believe it’s called a fluorescent dye). Then for 60 minutes, the vial containing the mixture will be placed in a simple DIY water bath that is heated to 65°C. Then, to stop the reaction, the water bath’s temperature will be increased to 80°C and the vial will be left in for a further 5 minutes.

Step 4 - Analyze the results by seeing if there is any color change or not. If there is any color change, it means that the patient tests positive for SARS-CoV-2. I am aware that analyzing the turbidity of the mixture in the vial is also an option.  
 

I plan to carry out steps 2, 3 &amp; 4 in a commercial-sized tent. I realize that the second step should be done in a BSL - 3 lab. But since I do not have the budget to design one and neither I am near to a BSL-3 lab, I plan to carry out step 2 in a simple DIY glove box (like this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSwJosoNbZY) at a separate section allocated for in the tent. BSL-1 &amp; BSL-2 protection will be worn by everyone who will work in the tent.

So can you please tell me if this plan is feasible (by feasible I mean that will this process work in order to detect the virus)? In addition do you feel that there are areas of this draft where I can reduce the cost? For example, can I, with the help of a molecular biologist, make the reverse transcriptase? Or is there any way that I can make a DIY kit to extract the RNA from the supernatant instead of using the ""QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit” as this kit is quite expensive.

I immensely appreciate any support that you may provide.

Thank you very much for reading my post.",4,2020-04-01 12:37:35,biology

As COVID 19 is spreading in Europe and America it is starting to spread in Africa. Generally speaking, [people in Africa have a better immune system than people in Europe](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0092-8674%2816%2931306-X). Thus an African body handles the COVID 19 virus better than an European body. Suppose COVID 19 mutates with respect to an African body and the mutated COVID 19 fights the immune system better than the current COVID 19 virus in an African body, does this imply that an European body will handle the mutated virus worse because European immune system is worse? 

In other words, is it possible that a mutated COVID 19 from Africa spreads in Europe can kill other age groups such as children?

Since no other sex cell exists. This would, of course, make sex a binary classification.

I find this argument fallacious since it would imply that people born sterile or transgender individuals who've underwent transition would cease to belong to either sex. The argument that the individual's potential counts also doesn't hold imo since there exists individuals who are born sterile. 

I feel determining biological sex by chromosomal makeup (XX, XY, etc(bimodal classification)) is far more effective since it doesn't appear of fallacious nature and accounts for all observations. I believe any scientific model should account for all individuals it encapsulates. Furthermore, it is more logically sound, since chromosomes are what determine what gametes are produced. it is of my belief that this means of determining biological sex is followed by most of the medical community.

Hi guys, just started learning some new subjects at A-level as I am looking for a career change, just picked up a biology book, this is a completely different world to coding/hacking/networking, this stuff is on a completely different level of learning IMO. Chemistry/biology is certainly a lot harder to learn than tech, but a lot more interesting. I am quite excited about learning something for once, it's interesting stuff.

Now, I am understanding relative atomic mass fine, but was interested in the following. Boron has two isotopes B (10 &amp; 5) and B (11 &amp; 5), but how does one actually calculate how many isotopes each element has? I can't seem to figure that out.

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for some suggestions as to how to approach a lab/research-related issue. I recently graduated w/ a BS in biochemistry and upon graduation joined a Neuroscience &amp; Genetics lab that conducts very interesting clinical research. However, having zero experience in neuroscience  I am finding it very difficult to understand any of the research papers that we discuss. With the COVID shutdown halting all of our in-lab work we are expected to discuss articles weekly and to be honest it could take me a day of reading and googling articles to even understand what is happening in many of these papers. I guess I am seeking feedback as to how to scale this Mt. Everest of a learning curve so that I can be a productive member of the lab.

Is this completely unique to humans, or are there other animals that show signs that they may be planning/imagining things?

Example:

I've heard that low ranking male bonobos get erect when they see a high ranking female (who they know they'll never be able to mate with) pass by. (This was in one of these lectures: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL150326949691B199)

If a signal cascade responsible for the development of asymmetric neurons is also responsible for innate immunity in both the neurons and in the intestines (such as in c. elegans p38 MAPK cascade), can that just be attributed to coincidence?

Wuhan has the only bs4 lab in all of China and it is a few streets away from the wet market where this whole thing supposedly began.

And then China seemed to have covid19's entire genetic sequence analyzed in a very quick amount of time (how long does it take to analyze an entire genetic sequence?)...

It definitely seems far less efficient.

That also makes me wonder why did those primitive cells evolve at all, the more we evolved the more complex we became, the more food and energy was needed for us to survive and the more of a hassle it became to find said food, while primitive cells can gain the necessary materials for reproduction from their surroundings.

Friends really wanted me out drinking so we went
Met some other friends (new)
I’m relatively healthy late 20s male
Have history of anxiety/depression but all my blood tests etc that I got done recently are normal 
I was drinking and was drunk then what happened is got into an argument with a group that almost escalated into a fight
Group walked away after but a girl in our group said a guy in other group hit her
So I ran over to other group as fast as I can, drunk
When I got to them we chatted they said they didn’t hit in
Moments later as I turned back right after the quick few seconds encounter I passed out and hit the ground (concrete with my head)
Stood up (middle of the street) and walked back
Threw up once
Think I had mild concussion went to doctors few days later got it called cleared and checked but did have headache for a few days

Either way, is this a good start to learning degree level biology? And, once I've finished it, what are some good follow-ups to read?

I’ve taken courses such as biology, chemistry, physics, stats, immunotherapy, neuroscience. I was on track to start an undergraduate research project but due to the pandemic, my project got cancelled. And my GPA as of right now is 3.9.

This means by far, I only have work experience as a lab technician and some small in-class research projects.

With my interest, should I consider PhD in neuroscience or PhD in immunology programs? 
How should I prepare myself before applying?

[Edmonton company Entos developing DNA vaccine against COVID-19](https://www.folio.ca/edmonton-company-entos-developing-dna-vaccine-against-covid-19/)



For thousands of years, we have coexisted peacefully with human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.  After all, they've caused little more than the common cold whenever their rhinovirus brethren were absent.  During that same time, we've also coexisted peacefully with a couple other human coronaviruses which have caused somewhat more serious illnesses.

Now, in the wake of SARS-CoV-2's COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian-based Entos Pharmaceuticals is working on a Fusogenix DNA vaccine:

&gt; “Many of the structural proteins in the virus are pretty well conserved across all the coronaviruses, including SARS and MERS,” said Lewis. “We’re hoping that if we express more of the structural proteins that are common to most coronaviruses, we can inhibit the current COVID-19 and also potentially protect against all coronaviruses both past and future.”

Does all this mean now is the time to deal a serious blow against the common cold, by removing the less dangerous coronaviruses from the picture?

Or might this be overreach leading to unforeseen consequences?  Are HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 still useful to have around, alongside the rhinoviruses?",2,2020-03-28 11:44:44,biology

I’ve just been recently debating when things will return to normal.

I think the only viable option that gives us a shot at returning to normal life is effective prevention/treatment.

As for prevention, that seems nigh impossible. Incubation periods of a respiratory illness spread via small aerosol that has periods up to 49 days in outliers is insane and makes me worry about any containment/normalcy in the next year.

So far the deadlines of the disease by itself doesn’t seem dangerous, but it’s transmission is worrying.

So what if you don’t die during this circulation - it’s so contagious paired with reports of infection via the already multiple existing strains is worrying too.

This is a jumbled post, I went down a rabbit hole of studies that aren’t being talked about because of the implications they have of the severity, but so far from what I see about

A) reinfection 

B) incubation 

C) the nature of the virus - has some of the same components that makes a HIV vaccine challenging

D) long term damage 

We are going to see billions of people directly effected by this virus in my own personal opinion.

I’m interested to hear anyone else who shares my sentiment, after reading early studies coming from China about the actual nature/biology of the virus in early January I came to the conclusion it would be like this in America but not as bad as it is currently.

I know this goes against the general opinion and I very would could be wrong - but this is going to be long, and devastating to society. 

The consensus with many in academia is that this virus isn’t a major disruption to society, I’d argue everyone in power is shouting that because they realize the potential this virus has to destabilize a lot of what we take for granted.

There's not a lot of light =&gt; not a lot of photosynthesis =&gt; not a lot of oxygen, and since cells need oxygen to metabolize, it seems reasonable that the creatures would be smaller too.

8652,fq0tdm,Open Question on Covid-19 and natural antibacterial properties of trees,"Hello everyone,

As I am quite closely following the advance of the Covid-19, like some of you I imagine, I was trying to understand some of the dynamics behind it, but from a more holistic approach, not focusing on the virus itself, but the environment in which it is present, as well as its history.

To my surprise, I saw that coronaviruses are much older than what I thought, even though the first discoveries of human coronaviruses appeared in the 1960s.

""Molecular clock dating analyses of coronaviruses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of these viruses existed around 10,000 years ago. This relatively young age is in sharp contrast to the ancient evolutionary history of their putative natural hosts, which began diversifying tens of millions of years ago.""

But also that the history is inextricably linked with their host:

""Indeed, phylogenetic studies of bat and avian coronaviruses suggest an ancient relationship with possible codivergence and coevolution with their hosts.""

Source for both quotes:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3676139/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3676139/)

Considering that the current coronavirus Covid-19 originates from bats, I excluded other avian species from the following reasoning.

The idea is to consider the environment in which bats have evolved throughout their history. This is where it gets kind of bold and some of you might think the reasoning is a bit sketchy. But I guess every idea is worth hearing. So I'll give it a shot, and you'll be free to answer me or disapprove the unorthodox approach.

**First assumption:**

\- Bats live/sleep/gather mostly in either caves, rock crevices, old buildings, bridges, mines, and trees.

For the purpose of narrowing the reasoning, let us focus on trees, because out of these locations, they are the only living specie *per se.* It is relevant because trees have developed their own natural defences, either immune or antibacterial, to fight against climate, parasites or some other externalities.

**Second (common) assumption:**

\- Bats are reservoirs of a vast array of bacterias, which can be found and quantified easily with feces' samples.

Here in table 1: you can find the list of bacterias present in bats droppings ([https://bioone.org/journals/acta-chiropterologica/volume-20/issue-2/15081109ACC2018.20.2.017/Fecal-Bacterial-Communities-in-Insectivorous-Bats-from-the-Netherlands-and/10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.2.017.full](https://bioone.org/journals/acta-chiropterologica/volume-20/issue-2/15081109ACC2018.20.2.017/Fecal-Bacterial-Communities-in-Insectivorous-Bats-from-the-Netherlands-and/10.3161/15081109ACC2018.20.2.017.full))

Now, some recent studies hint that plants have some effective antimicrobial properties against faecal bacterias. (Source: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6555726/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6555726/))

**Underlying reasoning:**

Considering that bats (and birds) defecate on trees (not exclusively obviously), and have been doing so forever, since trees constitute a large portion of their natural habitat. Would it be reasonable to establish that trees, considering their strong resistance to most externalities (as aforementioned), have developed a natural antimicrobial against faeces, respectively bat faeces (which again, contain a plethora of bacterias)? Considering that bats are present on most parts of the globe, then it would also be reasonable to establish that this alleged antibacterial is present in most if not all trees' bark around the globe.

(I say ""tree's bark"" because it would seems logical to me, considering it is the location onto which faeces end up being.)

**Here is the underlying question:**

\--&gt; Does anyone know of an antibacterial, present in most if not all trees' bark, responsible for dealing/protecting against animal faeces' bacterias ?

If not, do you know someone, experienced in the field of microbiology on plants/trees, that might be able to answer this question ?

For those who took the time to read, thank you,

Two Chinese Coronavirus studies, 14 years apart:  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708987](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15708987) (2005) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478436/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6478436/) (Feb 2019)

&amp;#x200B;

Both used modified vaccinia Arkana virus to create strains for study.

However, that's where the similarities end.  In the 2005 study the scientists, in the very first paragraph, discuss the dangers of SARS virus research, and the possibility of a live virus leak.

In the 2005 study - they developed a strain that is ""replication incompetent"" in mammals.  

14 years later, however, in February 2019 study, those researchers- write nothing about concerns of potential dangers to the public.  Those scientists - put the strain into macaques, which are mammals.  So that strain - *was* replication competent.

The second study differed from the first also in that it was a study of humoral (not innate) immunity.  So those live strains were given an HIV backbone and later neutralized.

This would also be super-consistent with what we know about COVID-19.  Many of the doctors and nurses are contracting it, despite their usual precautions against viruses.  i.e. If scientists studied a live mamamalian version of it in Feb. 2019, they probably *caught* it themselves.

Also people claim that by today not one virus was extract from the body like HIV, measles, smallpox etc etc thats you can find out in the world living on its own.. im confused and idk what to think..
So my question is can someone explain this stuff if its possible, what are viruses, how are they form, where they comefrom, and is this theory real or just a hoax.. im not a biologist or something and if i made mistake dont attack me im still new into this and intrested to learn, i know that this is more for virology  but this subreddit has more people so i decided to post here, thanks by anymean if someone is willing to explain..

During this outbreak I've been interested in why some people are showing severe symptoms while others are invisible carriers. That got me thinking about jobs I'd be interested in using genomic data and disease outcomes. So I'm curious about two things. First, what sort of jobs would look at data that could answer these questions? Things like likelihood of severe outcomes and genomic relationship (in diseases other than just viral too), but also spread of factors in a population and determining likelihood that a given therapy will work based on genomic data. Are these all research jobs or are there public health positions, private company positions etc that also have people working on this? I imagine they would do a lot more too so I'm curious what your thoughts are on the overall duties and I'd appreciate specific examples of jobs to look into.

Secondly, There are hundreds of programs out there that could probably train me for something like this, but do you guys know of any programs that could offer financing at the master's level?

8759,fouz19,Modern Environmental Exposure Theory,"Hello all. I’m a neuroscience undergraduate student currently and for the past couple years (before I even started college) I’ve been really racking my brain and I honestly have 100% stake in this theory. I’m here for someone to give me convincing arguments/disprove it but from my perspective it’s the most plausible thing I’ve come up with before.

From my anecdotal experiences in life, it seems the general populations health is declining both mentally and physically. The amount of people I know in real life or have seen online with the same general symptoms bothers me. There’s something common that is causing people to be listed as chronic fatigue, or chemical sensitivity etc... 

Controversial part incoming - I think just about everything we use in today’s world is accumulating toxicity/inflammation/damage in the human body and the large companies know this, but since they fund/have ties a majority of studies on modern “consumptions” and products we don’t see studies represented accurately. I know this is a question of this is the trade off worth it - and that’s where my next question comes in.

Is the heavily increasing diagnosis of brain/bodily diseases, auto immune diseases, sensitivities etc caused by increase of detection/testing with a combination of seeing the effects more because people live longer, or is there really unknown factors influencing the general health of the population? 

I believe the latter. IMO our knowledge of biology is essentially what our knowledge of physics/the universe was before the great minds we have today. Basically lots of unknown and complete guesses, which is really the vibe I get from upper academia and professionals. There seems to be a culture that because we can’t prove it in biology, we shouldn’t worry about it which I think has led to the situation we are in as a whole now.

Example - “no evidence that *food/product/drink/additives/preservatives* causes X” 

The public interprets that as it isn’t happening. How in the fuck are we going to know what any of these random things do without long term studies that focus on all aspects of human health? Unrealistic I know, but I feel like as a population it should be more rigid when thinking about what’s effecting our bodies.

I think I’m going to receive a lot of negative opinions/on this, but it’s just a theory that I’ve talked to a couple of my professors about and let’s say that don’t disagree. (Not saying negative feedback isn’t warranted, if I’m dead wrong/ignorant I would like to know) 

From my perspective, the fact we conclude half the shit we do about what is/isn’t harmful is complete utter horseshit and, again from my perspective - a lot of what we say is un harmful, just means we truly just don’t know yet.


Okay now a side bit which motivated me to make this post - 

I personally used to think anyone talking about EMF being harmful was an idiot until I progressed further into my classes. I looked studies up out of curiously today. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685799/

“Due to this data, an IARC advisory committee has recommended to reassess the cancer risks associated with RF radiation15). This should be a “high priority,” according to the panel’s report, which was issued on April 2019. A number of scientists argued that IARC should upgrade RF to a “probable” cancer agent [Group 2A] or simply “carcinogenic to humans” [Group 1].”

“Although EMF exposures related to mobile phone use are well within the current safety standards, it should be noted that these standards have been based solely on the expected thermal effects of EMF, disregarding any possible non-thermal effects.”

“Since then new data was published, also meta-analyses, indicating that longterm (over 10 yr) use of mobile phone increases the risk of intracranial tumors, most of all glioma, especially in the case of ipsilateral exposure10,11,12,13,14).”

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3780531/

“Twenty-three different studies have found that such EMF exposures act via activation of VGCCs, such that VGCC channel blockers can prevent responses to such exposures (Table 1). Most of the studies implicate L-type VGCCs in these responses, but there are also other studies implicating three other classes of VGCCs.

Both extremely low frequency fields, including 50/60 cycle exposures, and microwave EMF range exposures act via activation of VGCCs. So do static electric fields, static magnetic fields and nanosecond pulses.”

“EMF activation of VGCCs leads to rapid elevation of intracellular Ca2+, nitric oxide and in some cases at least, peroxynitrite. Potentially therapeutic effects may be mediated through the Ca2+/nitric oxide/cGMP/protein kinase G pathway. Pathophysiological effects may be mediated through the Ca2+/nitric oxide/peroxynitrite pathway. Other Ca2+-mediated effects may have roles as well, as suggested by Xu et al. [26].”

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6025786/

“Oxidative stress occurs if the antioxidant defense system is unable to prevent the harmful effects of free radicals. Several studies have reported that exposure to EMF results in oxidative stress in many tissues of the body. Exposure to EMF is known to increase free radical concentrations and traceability and can affect the radical couple recombination. The purpose of this review was to highlight the impact of oxidative stress on antioxidant systems.”

“It is possible that every interaction between RF fields and living tissues causes an energy transfer resulting in a rise in temperature. The skin and other superficial tissues usually absorb the non-thermal radiations emitted by mobile phones; this causes the insignificant increase of temperature of the brain or other organs in the body [2].”

“The results of the recent studies not only clearly demonstrate that EMF exposure triggers oxidative stress in various tissues, but also that it causes significant changes in levels of blood antioxidant markers. Fatigue, headache, decreased learning ability, and cognitive impairment are among the symptoms caused by EMF”

Outlandish theory - the uptake in chronic fatigue disorder and other vague disorders is this. We’ve seen an increase in generalized, unknown disorders that encompass the same systems.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27012122/

“The number of people suffering from EHS in the world is growing describing themselves as severely dysfunctional, showing multi organ non-specific symptoms upon exposure to low doses of electromagnetic radiation, often associated with hypersensitivity to many chemical agents (Multiple Chemical Sensitivity-MCS) and/or other environmental intolerances (Sensitivity Related Illness-SRI).”

8787,fok8zw,What if there were no photosynthesis on earth?," 

What would happen if there were no photosynthesis on earth? 

Then looking at the earth from space, the earth can not be blue, because there can be no oceans on the earth at that time. 

Without photosynthesis, there would be no oxygen; without oxygen, there would be no ozone produced by the sun's ultraviolet rays irradiating oxygen; without ozone, ultraviolet rays would be directly incident on the earth's surface, no matter how much water there is on the earth's surface. will be directly irradiated by ozone, will be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. 

Maybe you have to say, doesn't this produce oxygen again? 

This is not the case, because the volume of hydrogen produced by decomposing water is much larger than that of oxygen, and there is only a small amount of oxygen. This small amount of oxygen will not have a chance to accumulate in the air, and it will react first with the material in the surrounding surface. For example, the iron in the rock is a large oxygen sucker, and the soil and rock will turn red after absorbing oxygen. 

Hydrogen, as the lightest gas, begins to float upward and finally spreads out into space. 

Although this process can be slow and weak, it is irreversible, so as long as the time is long enough, no matter how much water there is on earth will flow into space in this way. 

This situation is not a mental hypothesis, it really happens on Mars. 

Mars is a planet full of oxidized iron-bearing rocks. The surface of Mars is red, there are no oceans, and there are no signs of life. 

But the oxygen produced by photosynthesis is more efficient and more efficient than ultraviolet radiation to produce oxygen, so that in the end, iron in all rocks, sulfur in the ocean, and methane in the air are oxidized. Substances that can combine with oxygen are filled with oxygen, but still more oxygen cannot enter the interior of the matter, so it has to fill the entire earth's atmosphere or dissolve in the ocean. Once oxygen is in place at this concentration, 

It is very difficult for the water on the planet Earth to escape to the universe. Even if hydrogen is released from the water, it will be intercepted by countless oxygen on the way out of the earth and fall back into water. 

The moisture of the ocean is thus preserved.

Is oxygen necessary for life? 

Actually, it's not. 

Many bacteria do not need oxygen, they are called anaerobes, for example, tetanus can only breathe without oxygen, yeasts can live in both aerobic and completely anaerobic environments, and there are a lot of anaerobes in our mouths. 

Bacteria can use almost anything to generate energy, such as giving them substances such as sulfates, and they can also react to generate energy, but the amount of energy produced in this way is too different from that generated by aerobic chemical reactions. 

So complex activities or energy-intensive activities can only use aerobic breathing to generate energy. 

What is the difference between the two ways of generating energy? 

For example, glucose, if anaerobic respiration, the efficiency value is 2%; if aerobic respiration, the efficiency value is 40%. 

The difference between the two is 20 times. 

This can lead to huge differences at the level of the food chain. 

For example, eagles eat snakes, snakes eat frogs, frogs eat grasshoppers, grasshoppers eat rice, this food chain has a total of four levels, each level of organisms do aerobic respiration consumes energy, then they use the next level of energy efficiency is 40%. So in the above example, only 2.56% of the energy generated by rice is used by eagles. 

Although this proportion is not high, it can maintain the food chain, because we often see this in nature. 

But if every organism uses anaerobic respiration, the efficiency of each stage is only 2%, and if the food chain is also level 4, then only one-6.25 million of the energy produced by rice can be used by eagles. 

Unless the rice on the earth is millions of times as large as it is today to keep the eagle full, the food chain will disappear. 

Therefore, without oxygen, the energy-consuming behavior of predation is not cost-effective for survival.

After the emergence of predation behavior, there will be an arms race-like competition between the predator and the prey, with the prey showing a hard shell and getting bigger to the extent that the predator gives up when he sees his body. 

Predators also have sharp teeth and grow in size. 

With oxygen, the behavior of predation is valuable, and with predators, it is necessary to get bigger, so with oxygen, large creatures are produced. 

Eventually this biological arms race will be stopped by touching the upper limit of aerobic respiration efficiency. 

The oxygen content in the atmosphere has varied greatly in the history of the earth, although there are many different models to estimate oxygen content, but the general conclusion is the same: from 500 million years ago to today, oxygen content has changed from 12% to 35%, the current is 21%. 

The oxygen content increased greatly from the Carboniferous period to the Permian period, and the 35% oxygen content also greatly increased the size of fish in the ocean during that period. Fish more than 2 meters in size are common, and there are many insects larger than 1 meter in size. 

For example, the wings of ancient dragonflies spread 80 centimeters, but now they are only 8 centimeters; at that time, deep-sea scorpions were 2.4 meters; ancient centipedes, fossils were 2.6 meters, but now they are only 20 centimeters; and horseshoe crabs, now known as ""living fossils,"" are also more than 2 meters in diameter. and now it's only about a dozen centimeters. 

These exaggerated figures are partly due to ultra-high oxygen levels. 

At the beginning of its birth, photosynthesis was just an efficient way to obtain energy. 

A creature more than one meter tall has a set of photosynthetic organs that can produce about 20 watts of power, which is a wonderful thing, and it was impossible to grow to such a large size before. 

But this way of generating energy produces a lot of oxygen. 

At the beginning of life, when the whole was anaerobes, oxygen was poison gas, and many bacteria could not live in an aerobic environment. 

At that time, the discharge of oxygen was the same as some factories now discharge large amounts of sulfides, nitrides, and polluted dirty water directly into the environment. 

This part of the organism releases oxygen into the environment, so it eventually leads to the mass extinction of anaerobes on the whole planet, and only a few lucky ones survive. 

The creatures that released oxygen into the air at that time are still living on Earth. They are cyanobacteria. 

Most plants that use photosynthesis have evolved to generate energy by photosynthesis during the day and respiration at night.

The burning of oil and coal consumes a lot of oxygen, but we have never worried that doing so will lead to a decrease in oxygen content, because the fixation of carbon on the earth is mainly done through rocks, and there is far more carbon fixed in rocks than in living organisms. 

Scientists have calculated that since 1840, humans have been frantically digging coal and oil out of the ground, and even later taking natural gas out and burning it, but it has been burning for more than 170 years today. we have also reduced the amount of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere by only 3/1000000. 

This shows how huge the amount of oxygen accumulated over the years is! 

The changes in life on earth are always worthy of attention. 

When we talk about paleontology, mass extinction, oxygen content fluctuating repeatedly, ice ages back and forth, even the present Beijing area is frozen under 2 kilometers of ice at its worst, and there is no ice cover in Antarctica at its warmest times. these messages give people the impression that the earth is a particularly volatile environment, no matter which kind of life on earth is at risk of extinction all the time. 

But if you can condense the changes of life on earth into one day, from the beginning of the formation of the earth, so that you can stare at the changes on the earth 24 hours a day, then you will be bored most of the time. 

After two and a half hours, bacteria have appeared, but because the bacteria are too small, you will not notice and think that nothing has happened. 

It has been 11 and a half hours since you first noticed a change. If you happen to go to the bathroom during this time, you will find that the earth's oceans are suddenly covered with blue-green algae when you come back. 

Then gradually appeared animals and plants, most of the time, these creatures do not change much, about every 1 to 2 hours there is a big rotation of organisms, the previous creatures are gone, the world's creatures will soon be replaced by new species. 

This change is random and short-lived, and it usually takes only eight or nine seconds to complete the extinction of old species and the birth of new species. If you are not careful, you will miss out on these dramas. 

In these eight or nine seconds, all the strenuous activities that affect life on Earth as a whole, such as volcanoes, earthquakes, changes in oxygen content, changes in frozen areas, changes in the pH of seawater, and changes in global temperature, will be completed in this short period of time. They are sudden and drastic changes, and then they will remain stable and unchanged for quite a long time. 

So in the history of life, not much change is the norm, each change is short-lived and drastic. 

Although the emergence of human beings has had a great impact on the earth's climate, the impact is negligible compared to the changes that have occurred in the earth's history.

Among the many viewpoints about the history of life, as long as we can choose a plausible context, this story will be convincing. 

The context of this article is: energy and time. 

In terms of energy, we compare the energy release efficiency of anaerobic respiration and aerobic respiration, and there is a great difference between them. 

There is conversion efficiency in the transfer of energy on the food chain. 

If the efficiency of each level is only 2%, then the food chain may have only 2 levels in total; if the efficiency of each level is 40%, the food chain may have 4-5 levels. 

Therefore, there are no complex animals in the early days of the earth, and the existence of complex animals shows that aerobic respiration is the main mode of survival. 

In the context of time, we condensed the entire life history of the earth into one day. 

In this day, complex life comes very late. 

And their survival and demise are not gradual, but sudden.",1,2020-03-24 23:37:39,biology

8850,fnxn6j,Why do people see the world differently? (Discuss Color vision systems of different people and species,"Many people have heard that dogs are color-blind.

To be exact, dogs are daltonism.

In fact, in mammals, except for primates, all other mammals are red-green colorblindness.

The reason why the eye can see is that there are two types of cells in the eye: one is called rod cells, which have little judgment on color, but are very sensitive to light, so night vision depends on rod cells.

There is also a type of cone, which can distinguish between colors, which is judged by the fact that when one color shines on it, the electrical signal it sends to the nerve is very strong, but when the other colors are irradiated, the electrical signal is very weak.

So one of these two types of cells is responsible for identifying whether there is light, and the other is responsible for identifying the color of light.

Fortunately, of all mammals, only primates have three types of cones, while other mammals have only two.

Three kinds of human cones output the strongest electrical signals when the light wavelengths are 560nm, 530nm and 420nm, respectively, and these three colors correspond to yellow, green and blue, respectively.

Other mammals have only yellow and blue cones.

So from a human point of view, all mammals are red-green blind.

Scientists have found that the vast majority of reptiles, fish, amphibians and birds have four kinds of cones, that is, they can see much richer colors than we do, and the world is very bright in their eyes.

Is it possible that the more we primates evolve, the weaker we are?

This may be a misunderstanding of evolution by many people.

Evolution does not necessarily develop in the direction of becoming more and more complex and powerful, but in the direction of more and more adapting to the environment.

Although mammals have appeared since the Jurassic, they can only be regarded as vulnerable groups, with small size and small living space, and most of them come out to look for food at night.

Many mammals today evolved from the branch of nocturnal mammals 200 million years ago.

For nocturnal animals, distinguishing what it is far more important than distinguishing color, so tens of millions of years ago mammals had to make enough room for rods to identify black and white so that they could see more clearly at night.

After the extinction of the dinosaurs that had ruled the earth, it made room for mammals to live, and the number of the latter soared.

However, the cones remained the same because there was not enough pressure on the environment and competitive species in color discrimination, so most mammals have had yellow and blue cones ever since.

Birds differentiated from dinosaurs are not extinct, so most birds have night blindness and can't see clearly as soon as the sun goes down.

Primates, on the other hand, have sprung up, leaving behind tricolor vision during an accidental gene mutation, which can give rise to a huge advantage in the jungle, so primates retain green-sensitive cones.

However, this gene has not been around in the primate branch for a long time, only for a few million years.

If you do the statistics, you will find that about 6% of the people in the population lack green-sensitive cones, that is, they are red and green blind.

Strictly speaking, they also have green cones, but the number is much smaller than other people.

In fact, they are the ones who inherited the ancestral genes of nocturnal mammals millions of years ago.

However, because the skill advantage of being able to tell whether it is green or not is so obvious in the jungle environment, the proportion of people with three kinds of cones is actually more than 94%.

We have hardly heard of blue-yellow blindness, because all mammals have blue and yellow cones, and only a small number of people do not retain the green cones that have just been developed. so most of the color blindness we see is red-green blindness.

Knowing the knowledge of eye color discrimination and the story of the evolution of cones in mammals, we can understand another thing: why tigers, dressed in yellow and black striped fur, can hunt in temperate jungles.

I was always confused when I was a child, because even if the tigers in the jungle had stripes, the yellow and black colors were so conspicuous in the green background. How on earth did they hide themselves?

Now we know that in the eyes of sika deer, tigers and grass are dark or shallow in black and yellow, because sika deer can not see green.

In this way, the stripes on the tiger play a hidden role.

If we have a set of switches in our eyes that can turn off the neurotransmission of green cones, then the world we see when turned off and on is very different.

If birds have a high IQ, they will also realize that the world in human eyes is very boring.

There are exceptions, however. In 2012, the University of California, Irvine identified a person with four types of cone cells.

The woman's name is Concetta Antico,. Her extra cone corresponds to orange.

What does the world look like in her eyes?

None of us can describe this, but in theory, everything she sees is more yellow and red than what we normal people see.

Scientists at the University of Irving studied her gene and found that the mutated gene occurred on the X chromosome, at OPN1MW and OPN1MW2, respectively.

In this respect, women have innate advantages. They are not easy to become red-green blindness, and they are more likely to become people with four-color vision, and it is estimated that women with four-color vision account for 2% of all women.

This is by no means a small group, but it is too difficult to confirm, and very few people have been identified.

This Concetta Antico is famous because she is not only a person with four-color vision, but also an impressionist painter, so her works are not only works of art, but also have some scientific research value.

Art professionals evaluate her works as: the color is seriously purple, and purple is a more cautious color in painting.

There is a theory that some colors inhibit people's perception of other colors, such as yellow and purple.

When yellow appears, the ability of the human eye to feel purple is weaker.

The female painter can receive yellow more sensitively in her eyes, so the purple in what she sees is not enough to stimulate the brain.

She thinks that paintings with balanced colors will obviously feel purple in the eyes of people like us who are not so sensitive to yellow.

For people with four-color vision, the sensitive wavelength of their cones to light still falls in the region of visible light, and the band of visible light is 400 nm to 750 nm.

But if the sensitive band of the newly mutated cones can fall in the ultraviolet or infrared region, the world in their eyes will be completely different.",0,2020-03-23 21:58:27,biology

8864,fnu51w,I dont have a career,"This is long winded, but here is some backstory 

I started college at 17. My whole life my parents had pressured me into being a doctor. I thought I wanted that as my future, but looking back on it, I just wanted to make them happy. Neither of my parent have degrees, so they had this idea that a bachelor's is like gold, and anyone who has one will live a life of luxury. I went to community college for 2 years and graduated with a 3.45 and over 75 credits. I then transferred to university, where I pursued a Bachelor's of Biology, with a focus in Human Biology. I was still planning on being a doctor. 

My college experience in the beginning was horrible, to put it lightly. I know people who have killed themselves for less than what I had gone through. My mental health was in free fall and my grades dropped fast. I wanted to take time off school and focus on healing, but my parents threatened to disown me and bar me from coming home if I even went to part time classes. I ended up retaking many upper division courses since I was failing them left and right. 

My second to last year in school, I realized I didn't want to go to med school, and I just wanted to get a good job and start living life. My school advisor initially told me that biology degrees have tonnes of high paying career options and I could make 6 figures without grad school. But when I finally looked into it, I realized there's not much available and I was devastated. I graduated with a 2.7 with about 80 credits. My GPA between both schools is maybe a 3.0. Not competitive enough for grad school of any kind. 

Now here is where I'm at now

I live in a very rural part of the US. The only lab jobs pay barely above minimum wage. I work as a dental assistant and make decent money, but there is no upward mobility in that job, and I cant make a career out of it. I'm 50k in debt, and my family resents me for not being wealthy and for still living at home. I'm in my mid 20s and I what I have left after my loan payment isnt enough to rent, even with roommates. 

I am very depressed regarding where my life is at. All of my friends and peers from school are living independently and have good jobs that pertain to their degrees. Or they went on to grad school and will be making great money soon. I dont know what to do. I cant afford to move to a place that has more opportunities for people in my position, and I'm afraid that if I go back to school to boost my GPA, that it wont be worth it. If I could, I'd got to PA school, but it's as hard to get into as med school.

TL,DR: I was pressured into getting a biology degree, cant go to grad school, and feel like I have no future.",9,2020-03-23 18:11:18,biology

8875,fnqkhf,Could regular throat disinfection help against the coronavirus?,"The virus plays a *numbers game*. A game of exponentials. Of course the idea is nothing new. We have all seen the graphs. We know that the more time it has to spread, the more new victims it can infect.

This also means that the earlier we stop the spread, the less severe the overall effect.  
That's why prevention (like washing hands, staying away from others etc.) is so important.

The problem though is that you need only slip up a few times and you are out of the *numbers game* \- the virus plays it without you from then on. Washing your hands helps little when you are infected already.

When that happens, we basically accept that the virus will run it's course. The best we can do is isolate, help with the symptoms and the complications - and hope.

*Does this need to be the case?* Isn't it possible to do something even after contracting the virus?

Just to recap in very simple terms, how does the infection occur? Most of the time we introduce the virus ourselves by touching our eyes, nose and mouth. Sometimes we inhale it via contaminated air.

The eyes are probably the least of our concerns. They are are fairly well isolated from the rest of the body and while infection through the eyes can't be ruled out, until we know better we probably shouldn't focus on it too much.

The nose has fairly efficient defense mechanisms already but more importantly the nasal cavity and the mouth meet at the same place - the throat.  
**Basically the throat is the gateway into our body.** And the main entry (and exit!) point for the virus as well.

Here comes the important part. Even in the throat the rules of the *numbers game* apply.  
The virus starts to multiply and as time goes on, progresses deeper - into the stomach (where it usually gets destroyed) and to the lungs where - in serious cases - it can wreak havoc.  
Unfortunately, once the virus reaches this point we usually no longer try to play the *numbers game* against it.

But why not? Can't we stay in the game? How?  
**Throat disinfection. Regularly.** Several times a day.  
The latter is key for three simple reasons:

1. The sooner you do this if you contract the virus, the more efficient it is. (A basic rule of the *numbers game*.) You can't really know right away when you get the virus. But you don't need to, if you do disinfection regularly.
2. It's proportion based. You need many repetitions to achieve good efficiency. Of course the real dynamic is more complicated but for simplicity's sake: if you kill a flat 40% of the virus in one go, you need five to kill \~90%.
3. The virus is doing it's thing too. It's basically a race where the opponent can get up and try again. The virus will do it. You should too.

That's why it's important to do it again and again. *Rinse and repeat.* Literally.

I'm not suggestion this could be a cure. But it could be something between prevention and treatment.

* It may help *you* as it may even kill the virus before it has a chance to spread. More likely it may slow it down to give enough time for your immune system to play it's own *numbers game* successfully.
* It may help *others* by decreasing the rate at which you infect those around you. Not only it helps if you can deal with the virus early on and stop spreading it. Your throat is also the primary source through which you infect others. Keep that to a minimum and you help everyone.

In principal we should always look for ways to stay in the game. Once the virus reaches the lungs, throat disinfection is no longer effective. Could we do something similar though? What about a sauna-like treatment (hot and moist air)? Or maybe we could come up with a gaseous disinfectant that is safe to inhale.

**Debate**

1. **Argument:** This cannot work because most of the viruses are inside the cells.  
**Answer:** True - the second part that is. A virus infection has a constant dynamic. Infected cells pop one after the other releasing new viruses into the environment while at the same time in said environment free viruses continuously attack healthy cells.  
But just because you can't attack the viruses *inside* the cells, doesn't mean there's no point in attacking those that are *outside*.  
It's about disturbing this dynamic. Maybe can't eliminate the entire virus population, but again - this is about *numbers*. You don't need to achieve 100% efficiency to have positive effect. If you have a *reasonable* efficiency - you can increase it. By repetition. The key is to slow it down to give enough time for the immune system.
2. **Argument:** You lost me with the sauna nonsense. It's a debunked hoax, everyone knows that.  
**Answer:** First, I'm not saying sauna as a cure is feasible. On that later.  
Second, the sauna debunking is hardly scientific itself. Noone claims this has been really tested. The argument is mostly something like ""there is no scientific evidence that high temperature kills the coronavirus."" Except it's an established scientific fact that viruses in general *do* have a certain temperature sensitivity.  
A 60-80 °C hot air in the lungs may not kill even the majority of the free viruses, let alone all of them (not to mention the ones inside the living cells), but why don't we consider less than 100% efficiency? If it *can* kill a *reasonable* portion of it - we can play the *numbers game*. Rinse and repeat.  
The fact is we don't know the dynamics. We know simple facts like the coronavirus *can* infect people in hot and humid environments. But what are the *numbers*? Is it as efficient as in cold and dry environments?  
Third, it's about the principle. The sauna might very well be something that has absolutely no positive effect. The question still remains - is there a way to *stay in the game*?",3,2020-03-23 14:48:46,biology

8885,fno822,"How does C Tetani germinate in very minor abrasions such as mine? The tetanus causing organism is supposed to be anaerobic. So theoretically it shouldn't be able to multiply in a surface wound with a good supply of oxygen, even after the wound closes.","So, tetanus is supposed to be anaerobic. Which is supposed to mean that it can't live in oxygen, or very low oxygen.

C Tetani is supposedly an obligate anaerobe, which supposedly means it cannot reproduce in any oxygen at all.

So, I see a lot of stories online about how people got ""minor cuts or abrasions"" and later on developed tetanus. These stories usually involve the wound getting infected by other bacteria as well as tetanus, but some are unclear about this. They also don't specify if there is any dead tissue in them.

Tetanus isn't supposed to be able to grow in healthy shallow wounds. But it seems like it does, according to internet.

This doesn't make sense because theoretically, a very shallow wound right on the skin surface would have an ample supply of oxygen and thus not allow tetanus to grow. But it does somehow ? I'm not sure what causes this but it freaks me out.

I just cut myself on the back of a dusty old air conditioner like 10 or so days ago. It's a very shallow scratch that bled for a minute, but the object that I cut myself on still makes me very nervous. I've been rotating my jaw so much lately checking for tetanus that I've actually got some soreness in my jaw now. Worries the hell out of me.  I didn't have a booster, but I did get all 5 of my primary vaccinations when I was a kid. I'm 23 now. Some sources say I should still actually be immune, but I'm nervous nonetheless. Amid this pandemic I wouldn't even be able to get medical care for tetanus.

So, I'm trying to help my mind rest easier. This thing has an incubation period of months long, so I could just come down with it at any time for the next two months or so, with no warning. That's the scarry part, and I still can't stop thinking about it 10 days later. Will probably continue to worry about it for the next 2 months way after the wound has healed if I don't do something.

So I ask, can something like this result in tetanus? https://imgur.com/eWmZlGW (this is what it currently looks like).

It seems to definitely not be infected. I can't tell if it ever had any dead tissue in it, I don't know what dead tissue looks like, but the bed of the wound was just all red like blood.

I read somewhere that for tetanus to germinate, there must either be lack of oxygen, dead tissue, or another infection present to help it along. I don't seem to have any of these with this wound, but could I still be at risk? 

Also, theoretically, if there is a tetanus infection in my wound, which is unlikely yes but still possible, what happens to it if it doesn't germinate? Does the spore just die? Does it sit under my skin and wait forever for an ideal environment? Wish I could ask a biologist but I'm not sure where to go for that.

I need to assess the risk here because I'm sick of worrying about this. I have very bad health anxiety and tetanus is my biggest fear.

I can go out and get a booster right now. Sure, that would put my mind at ease. But with all the outbreaks here I risk catching the virus and giving it to my parents if I go see a medical professional. So I'm trying to decide if that's even necessary. Trying to determine if there is even any risk for this wound.

So, even if tetanus is inside my wound, is there any way it can germinate in a wound like this?",2,2020-03-23 12:43:24,biology

8891,fnl4gt,Coronavirus infections and immune responses," 

For those interested in a summary of the interaction of the Coronaviruses and our immune systems, and the implications on vaccine development:

&gt;**CONCLUSIONS:** Since the emergence of SARS‐CoV in 2002 and its spread throughout 32 countries and areas, the world has experienced the outbreak of MERS‐CoV and now, the 2019‐nCoV. All these viruses belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae in the family Coronaviridae. Since CoVs emerge periodically and unpredictably, spread rapidly, and induce serious infectious diseases, they become a continuous threat to human health. This is especially true when there are no approved LI ET AL. | 429 vaccines or drugs for the treatment of CoV infections and there exists a range of animal reservoirs for CoVs and recombinant CoVs. In recent years, profound understandings of the innate immune response to viruses have been made. This type of immune response inhibits virus replication, promotes virus clearance, induces tissue repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective, universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the virus spread, vaccine development can be time‐consuming. To fulfill the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS‐induced lung injury cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense.  
However, accomplishing this is not impossible. Notable achievements have been made in analyzing detrimental and protective mechanisms. For instance, completely blocking a proximal event in the immune response (eg, activation of IFN response‐related PRRs) seems unwise considering its general role in regulating the host defense. In contrast, more limited and specific effector arms, such as controlled production of oxygen radicals, NET formation, IL‐1, IL‐4, IL ‐6, IL‐8, and IL‐21 production, are probably practicable targets. At last, further research is needed to improve the understanding of the temporal features of CoV‐induced inflammatory response in relation to the timing of therapeutic interventions

Many other top results are mentions of the average coronavirus incubation period. 

My line of thinking is that the sooner the symptoms show, the more quickly the disease has reached a point of significant interference(I imagine there’s a better way to phrase this), which leads me to think that there was a large initial exposure or that there is weak resistance. 

With a longer incubation period, I’m imagining that the body has a longer period of time to develop the necessary cells to combat the disease and the peak severity will be a lesser threat.

8957,fmxo7z,What determines a species is different within it's group and why is this not applied to humans?,"This question keeps getting removed from AskScience, so I thought I'd come here for an actual answer. 

When we talk about any animal or insect there's always mention of multiple species within that family.

For example: Penguins. Species: Magellenic penguin, Southern rockhopper penguin, King penguin, Gentoo penguin, etc. (Obviously not the scientific name for these but you get the idea)

Which also leads to sentences like this from Wikipedia: ""Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south.""

So one of the questions is: what is the defining factor that determines something is a different ""species"" within the same group?

The other question is: when we talk about humans we are one species even though there are differences among us, there is never a mention of multiple species or sub-species within the current human group. Why does the answer to question one not apply to humans?",6,2020-03-22 05:10:38,biology

8970,fmuiht,Humans Carrying capacity k,"I took a college biology course a few years ago so posting here if this rings a bell with anyone/for clarification. I vaguely remember learning about humans reaching their k carrying capacity (it’s like this exponential graph on population)a long time ago (or that’s what some have theorized at least). Typically when other species reach their capacity they are “capped” off due to lack of food, shelter, space, disease, etc. By “called” off, I mean they die and don’t reproduce enough to grow that group or something? (This is where I’m getting lost) 

I can be 100% off here but I can’t help but think COVID is doing that to humans. We have a LOT of people on this Earth and a limited supply of resources- our “k carrying capacity” (or whatever this concept is that I learned yrs ago) is reached and this disease is killing us off. It’s taking out huge numbers compared to anything in this day and age. I don’t know why this isn’t discussed more. Is it me? Am I being too science Fiction-y with this? 

My question in a nutshell- Is covid killing our species since we’ve, as a species, reached k carrying capacity? (Which may or may not be the correct term I’m looking for here- biology class was yrs ago. Plz clarify if you know of this term/concept!)",10,2020-03-22 00:10:46,biology

However, after visualization of the western blot, it could be seen that the band had a higher than expected molecular weight (~2-4kDa higher than the first SDS-PAGE ran). Is there a reason why the protein on the first SDS-PAGE had a different molecular weight than when it was run on a western blot? The only thing I can think of is maybe the sample used in the western blot had retained more post translational modification since the discrepancy is small (~2-4kDa).

With cancers killing 1 in 6 people globally, there is a good chance that you and me will some day encounter the disease, or have someone really close to us encounter it. Choosing the correct therapeutic option can be challenging and this makes it increasingly important for us to understand the cellular aspects of the disease. 

Here is a closer look at the cellular story of cancer. Cancer cells are real survivors! Not only do they learn to divide in a mass scale, but also silently move out of their tissue, travel large distances across the body and settle in distant sites.

A former supervisor of mine was just laid off and reached out to me looking for a LinkedIn endorsement. He did not offer to reciprocate or give me endorsements.

My experience with him did not warrant a LinkedIn endorsement and if anyone had asked me I would never have given excellent feedback. As a scientist I didn't usually agree with his ideas or approach, as a supervisor his communication skills left a lot to be desired. He is somebody who I would hope would never use me as a reference. He was my hiring manager but as soon as I caught onto his management style, I figured out a way to make a department transfer and went for it.

I left the company a few months ago and I'm back in grad school now, so I don't think that there should be any consequences for telling him no, but I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to help me say it in a way that 1) puts the responsibility back on him and 2) doesn't leave him holding a grudge against me when I'm trying to just be professional.

Our PCR laboratory will feature 3 rooms: A reagent prep room, a sample preparation room (DNA extraction) and a post-PCR laboratory. Since we are designing the building, we get to decide what air flow we need throughout this unidirectional workflow. 

Now. It's clear to me that the reagent prep room, the ""cleanest room"", needs positive pressure to keep contaminants out. Also clear - the post-PCR room needs negative pressure to keep amplicon contaminants IN. What is not clear to me is how to treat the extraction room. 

In both of my previous labs, we didn't have the luxury of having a separate room for DNA extraction. DNA extraction was considered a ""pre-PCR"" activity and done under positive pressure in the pre-PCR area. HOWEVER, upon further research, I've found multiple sources which say the DNA extraction room, being ""dirtier"" than the reagent prep room, should have negative pressure like the post-PCR room for the reason of keeping DNA inside the room and nowhere else. 

This resource, on page 13, shows that the nucleic acid prep room should have negative pressure, and then on page 16 shows an example floor plan with POSITIVE pressure in the extraction room! https://www.aphl.org/programs/newborn_screening/Documents/2015_Molecular-Workshop/Molecular-Laboratory-Design-QAQC-Considerations.pdf

I have found conflicting sources online about what to do about this. I would really appreciate any insight. For context, our rooms are separated by a shared hallway. My concern with putting negative pressure in the DNA extraction room is that we will pull in amplicon contamination. This is the room in which we will be opening our reaction tubes to add DNA template - I wouldn't want to introduce amplicon contamination at that point.

I have heard of Ray Peat before from a diet group, but I can't find anything online regarding his legitimacy. 

Would anyone be so kind as to take the time to skim through it and tell me what they think? Thanks in advance. 

The Interview:

RP: Have you heard of Peter Duseberg and the HIV critics? I started graduated school in biology in 1968, and I think it was in 1969 Baltimore published an article saying that they had evidence that DNA could be transcribed into RNA, and according to the existence of that enzyme it was a possibility for a virus to insert it's from RNA to DNA, it could leave its trace, its genes into nucleus, and at the time all of my molecular biology professors denied that is possible because they had the dogma that genetic information goes only from DNA to RNA to protein, and so the idea that protein could be a virus or the RNA could be integrated into the genes as a virus, RNA was suppose not to be translatable into DNA, but it turns out that are full of retroviruses, some people say, huge proportion of all of our genes consists of retroviruses and during stress we emit these as possible part of curative system. In around just a little while after that there was an acupuncture Langley Pamflet, had written by a Nord korean, claiming he had evidence of particles of nucleic acid circulating in our lymph, he said it look like lymphatic system, but he said it was a completely separate circulatory system, a third circulatory system, carrying this virus like particles that were actually emitted by cells to repair cells and other parts of the body. He wrote that around 1965, I think, and just in last 10 years or so, it’s now recognized that we are full of this tiny particles carrying RNA and DNA and proteins emitted under stress, aging and any sort of sickens and stress cause cells to emit particles that circulate, so that they could come out of the stressed tissue be carried in the blood to the bone marrow for example, and change cells in bone marrow so they are able to repair the injured cell, two-way communication of viral like particles, and since are our genome is full of this viral type particles, retroviruses, that’s a very plausible idea that viruses could originate from stress organisms. We know that epidemics originate in famines, wars and conditions to the stress organism, and they don’t necessarily have to travel only like the green monkey theory of aids traveling to humans, or snake to monkey to cats and humans and the chinese virus. 40 years ago they were two botanist researching plant viruses, at Oregon State University, and they would use plumes? powder on the fingers and robbed the solutions of the plant viruses into the leaves of plants to create the viral disease that they were studying, and in a short period of time both of those researchers came down with the same kind of rare degenerative brain disease, which to me was very suggested that a plant virus had invaded their system, and I stopped eating raw vegetables 😊.

O couple of publications in the last few years have found that with in the body, is now known that not only go to bone marrow to change our immune system cells, they can actually go to the gonads and enter our germ cells, so that can be pass on, so it's exactly the situation that Darwin propose with his gemmules coming from al of the body parts going in to the gonad modifying them for inference acquired characteristics, but in the resent research they were just demonstrated the microvesicles do enter germ cells among other cells, and 80 years ago people were talking about the strange properties that exist within a continent, they see similarities between plants and invertebrates insects and such, and the various mammals, all variety of organisms share some properties within the continent, that evolution doesn't explain those and so they propose that long time ago that particles, like pollen for example, carries genetic information we breathe it, and a lab in Germany, going back 50 years at least, has demonstrated that if you eat beef for example, you can trace the genetic DNA patterns, long pieces of DNA from the beef that you ate into your blood stream and into your cells, we incorporated not only viruses but just cellular DNA from the various species that we eat, so it's entirely possible that when you cough on someone for example that they inhale not only viral infection but your DNA, is all around you, and anyone who contact you is expose? to that. Now they demonstrated that in good number of people, have been tested, and after death they could test that a womans brain tissue, and found that DNA traces in her brain and other tissues of each of her previous husbands, so DNA is much more pervasive than we usually think. Its pretty much a continuous string of information of genetic material.

PT: So, was Darwin on something?

RP: He had all the principles down, but just, he didn't know the detail, he didn't know such of thing like DNA, but he had the idea right.

I sort a sympathize with Trump, I think the CDC has been helping a couple of drug companies to increase their share values, sky rocketing share prices of vaccine maker, and both WHO and CDC have that connection with the vaccine industry and a lot of people have been exposed for corruption but no one is doing anything about it, so in a typically year CDC has sad that an average of about 40000 americans die from flu so now they are getting excited when a few dozens of people die of corona, its out of proportion what they claim to be the usual annual mortality from flu. The way the CDC has built up the market for flu vaccines is to call anyone who dies of pneumonia a death from influenza, but very old person, say 100 old person, without any particular sickness, might just eat too much raw cabbage or something, giving some gas, and that will cause pneumonia, so people die of pneumonia can't be counted of flu deaths, sa CDC has been fudging on that. But, it happens, that over 10 years ago, the corona virus was known to simply activate the well-known inflammation systems, the angiotensin system for decades we have the angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. The angiotensin converting enzyme produces the inflammatory protein that causes blood pressure to rise and so on, and there is a close interaction between serotonin and angiotensin, and both are well-studied a causes of aging related inflammation so your angiotensin exposure and production will increase in old age that will increases your likely to get pneumonia from anything, it's a general inflammatory system that increases contraction of blood vessels and risk of clotting and fatigue, interfering with energy production and so on. The people who were dying at a very high rate from the corona virus are those who already suffering from circulatory disease, heart disease, hypertension and stroke, so they already have an active angiotensin system and the virus finds an environment already going in that direction. It happens that the ACE angiotensin converting enzyme #2, ACE2, it's a dereceptor for the virus, the virus attaches to that and in the process of entering the cell and becoming infective, and ACE2 is the enzyme that undoes the work of ACE in the cells and ACE produce angiotensin and ACE2 then destroys angiotensin so what the virus does in binding to ACE2 seems to be inactivating the inactivator of angiotensin that leaves ACE free to make angiotensin which then doesn't have any way out and it accumulates causing all of the dry cough, the high fever and increased hypertension and stroke and so on.

PT: .... oriental people tend to have more of the ACE2 in their body, it's that posible?

RP: If its ACE2, that will let them be a better target for the virus, but it will also suggest that having that without the virus would be more resistence to the age related inflammation, that's the protective enzyme, ACE2 destroys angiotensin if you have a lot of it, you are like a young person. Young people have more of that, so are less susceptible to the virus but also to the age related degenerative diseases.

PT: Why are so many people infected like in Wuhan city?

RP: Have you heard about the military games? The american solders left exactly 14 days before the outbreak. South Korea and Taiwan virologists have traced the gene pattern back, and found that in the USA were 5 different strains of the coronavirus, the Wuhan strain it's just one of those, and they say logically you can derived to Wuhan from one of those preexisting 5 strains, but you wouldn't have at this time 5 descendants, and the inheritance goes the other way that the Wuhan strain is like a branch on the tree and the preceding variety of the virus were existing in the USA already.

And you know the CDC pattern of the coronavirus 17 years ago? And research have been done at Fort Detrick supposityle are creating pathogens to create vaccines to counter them, so the suggestion have been made that was an accidental release of that. An article in Nature, years ago, recent comment on that old article, people indicate that virus originated at Fort Detrick lab, and that could be not possible because they will incriminate the Fort Detrick 😊.

PT: But its possible in Europe Union

RP: Yes

PT: It was a bioweapon thing, and I guess it could be very possible that this was a whole controled release thing for all kind of political reasons?

RP: Yes. They shut down the lab in July or august, and then there was an epidemic of lung damage or pneumonia blamed on vaping poisons, but then, shortly after that the Wuhan episode.

PT: So, some af this strains were lab created, that pose a more real problem for the human immune system to deal with it, if it's coming from outside of them, but it could be in our bodies anyway?

RP: In the lab you could accelerate evolutionary changes and make very improbable things that might never statistically happen in living organism.

PT: Witch makes it not easy for the human body to work with it because evolution can figure out where it go with this viruses

RP: Yes, in this labs researching pathogens, creating pathogens to imagine an attack and how to create a vaccine to it. The pathogens they create are more imaginative than nature.

PT: So, i guess someone will come out with a vaccine for this soon?

RP: Yes, that's way the stock market prices of vaccine come on it have gone so much up, because say they are close to come on the market with it. But, the trouble is, ever since before this swine flu, the guy who got fired for exposing the nonexistence of the swine flu, he was warning the whole thing is pointless because flu viruses mutate faster than you could create a vaccine and tested for safety, so by the time you can show the vaccine is working and safe, there will no be flu left to do, to prevent.

PT: What do you think, there is people around over the years that this HIV thing is not really a virus that you can see, and just is not there?

RP: I follow Peter Duseberg argument closely, now for 40 years, and he has never been proven wrong, he lost his research grants, and is now officially out of the science world because he persist with his evidence. He says that genetic DNA is a retrovirus, a harmless retrovirus, and we are full of this such DNA, and when we are under stress its shows up in the blood so you can have a blood test for it, but all is showing is a stressed individual, and that is just one of many pieces of DNA that shows up in this cloud. At the time he was presenting his argument, this other information of this microvesicles carrying DNA and RNA all through the body every time we under stress, that just wasnt known, except in this acupuncture world, but now its common knowledge that stress causes retrovirus material to explode into the blood streams, so you can find it and sell a blood test for just about anything you can imagine. People have tested blood samples take it from army recruits decades before anyone suggested there was aids or HIV virus, from 1960 for example, and giving the standard DNA analysis to those blood samples, every year tested half percent of the population, tested positive for aids. More recently when you go across and actually look at random blood sample is still half of percentage is infected. If you pick up sick people you will find very high percentage. Peter Duseberg sad it correlated exactly with their use of particular drugs, the drug causes stress and causes a virus to come out, as well as causing the sickness, so there was a correspondence that was caused by drug use. After the treatment came out Peter Duseberg sad you are creating the virus you were treating, but before that he correlated, there was a fad of using a vasodilator drug for pleasure experience like poppers, this particular drug creates a very intense stress reaction that causes of release of this retroviruses.

PT: Could they pass on this virus to somebody else to sexual encounters?

RP: Yes, The same way a mother passes on this microvesicles, it's a normal thing, whatever circulating in your blood stream to show up in the egg or the sperm.

Unfortunately, I had the time management skills of a potato and graduated with a 3.1 GPA. Definitely NOT competitive for med school. So, I went to grad school and am on track to graduate in May 2021 with a MS in Biology. Although I feel like I am thriving in grad school, I definitely don't love it enough to go into academia afterwards (i.e. pursuing a PhD).  

**The problem:** I still love medicine, however, my dismal undergrad GPA makes it nearly impossible to go the MD/DO route. I could go into EMS, but I'm worried that my BA/MS degrees would be put to waste since paramedics only need an Associate's degree (one that I do NOT currently have and would have to go back to school to get). The same is true for PA school in that I would have to go back to school to get yet another degree (I'm not completely opposed to this, but I would like to start making money as opposed to spending it at some point). 

**The question(s)**: How can I use my current credentials (BA/MS Biology) to work in the clinical medical field? Would it be worth it to go back to school for another couple of years to get a different degree (e.g. EMT-P, PA, MLT, etc.)?

2 slugs with a shell that looks like a spiral cone. Roughly 3 mm in length.

2 slugs that have a shell that looks like a rolled up rope, relatively flat.

3 brine shrimp

4 things that look like krill/shrimp. These are small but in my other jar 1 of them grew to a lenght of 1cm.

1 dead rainworm that accidentaly came in woth the soil 

1 tik like creature 1mm body, 2mm if you count the legs. It might be a tik but i dont know of they can sirvive underwater for 5 days.


1 thing that looks like a little leech. Roughly 9mm long and pretty much just flat and gray.

Removing some stem cells from this genus of jellyfish, then inserting them in a human embrio is the leading theory on how to make homosapiens immortal.


Turritopsis dohrnii is now officially known as the only immortal creature. The secret to eternal life, as it turns out, is not just living a really, really long time. It’s all about maturity, or rather, the lack of it. The immortal jellyfish (as it is better known popularly) propagate and then, faced with the normal career path of dying, they opt instead to revert to a sexually immature stage.

It turns out that once the adult form of the 4.5 mm-wide species Turritopsis dohrnii have reproduced, they don’t die but transform themselves back into their juvenile polyp state. Their tentacles retract, their bodies shrink, and they sink to the ocean floor and start the cycle all over again",3,2020-03-18 08:51:58,biology

9213,fkjmic,Question about exergonic and endergonic reactions,"We know that if we have an exergonic reaction it means that the product(s) of that reaction have less energy than the input molecule(s), thus this reaction releases energy.

We also know that an endergonic reaction means that the product(s) of such a reaction have more energy than the input molecule(s), and so this reaction consumes energy in order to take place.

We are also told that exergonic reactions are spontaneous, and endergonic reactions are non-spontaneous. 

My question is why exergonic reactions are spontaneous and endergonic reactions are non-spontaneous? I will explain why I am confused: We know that both exergonic and endergonic reactions have a transition state, which is the highest energy state. In order to get a reaction from substrate to product we have to input enough energy, known as the activation energy, in order to achieve that transition state and bring the reaction to completion. 

So, since the transition state will always be higher in energy than the reactants or the products, regardless if we are talking about an endergonic or exergonic reaction, it seems like we will always need to have some input of energy to get the reaction going, making both reactions ""non spontaneous""?

An excerpt from Wikipedia: ""This might lead some to suggest that decreasing the levels of ACE2, in cells, might help in fighting the infection, but that conflates ACE2 with the ACE2 receptor. ""

Does this suggest that the virus is mimicking ACE2 to the ACE2 receptor and gaining entry this way? Or is my understanding correct that it's mimicking angiotensin to ACE2 (using the virus' S1 subunit of the spike protein) and there is no ""ACE2 receptor""?",7,2020-03-17 03:01:53,biology

9264,fk0t0d,Question about CRSPR combined with stem cells,"Hi all, I’m chemist but I have a biology question that I hope someone could answer for me. 

This questions relates to coming up with a solution to gender dysphoria.There seems to be a lack in the development of GRS (gender reassignment surgery) and other methods in order to align a patients physical and mental viewpoint. Having read some papers and I believe the answer is out there now but it is not being pushed towards. 

My thoughts are CRSPR combined with one of the following would give a patient a more ideal solution than what is currently on offer. CRSPR is used to delete the non-ideal sex determining genes (DMRT1, ENH13, SOX9, FOXL2 etc). This gene therapy would be carried out after the other technique has been completed. I know that CRSPR is in its initial trail phase.  

CRSPR combined with bone marrow transplant with the hematopoietic stem cells which would hopefully result in stable (mixed or Full) chimerism. It would require an MTF (male to female) patient and an FTM (female to male) patient but if they are a match then could they do a sex organ swap? There have been cases in which bone marrow transplants in a person of a different gender does result in chimerism. 

Or CRSPR combined with stem cell lab grown organs. This again is in its infancy but there have been plenty of strides forward that would give anyone promise. Most of the parts of the genitalia have been grown or at least cells of it. I will say once again it is in its infancy.

What kind of work would the virus be doing in the eye lids membrane cell's?  Does it start replicating and if so does it do any damage?  And/Or is it just getting in to the blood stream and making its way to its final destination?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; The most well-known example is through membrane fusion. In viruses with a [viral envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope), viral receptors attach to the receptors on the surface of the cell and secondary receptors may be present to initiate the puncture of the membrane or fusion with the host cell. Following attachment, the viral envelope fuses with the host cell membrane, emptying the now-bare virus into the cell. In essence, the virus's envelope ""blends"" with the host cell membrane, releasing its contents into the cell. Obviously, this can only be done with viruses that have an envelope (examples of such enveloped viruses include [HIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV), KSHV[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#cite_note-6)[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#cite_note-7) and [herpes simplex virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex_virus).[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_entry#cite_note-8))",4,2020-03-16 10:20:42,biology

The actual active ingredient for a drug for acute treatment and prophylactic application, is already known to medical scientists around the world as GAMMA-INTERFERON.

This substance GAMMA-INTERFERON must now only be isolated by the responsible specialists and separated from the corresponding products, which contain this high-quality defence substance against pathogens, in order to then process it into a corresponding medicine, which can be administered to humans.The substance GAMMA-INTERFERON is a natural product of chemical transformation, e.g. when milk is converted to YOGURT or KEFIR. So it is only necessary that the GAMMA-INTERFERON is removed from the mentioned products and converted into a drug.this GAMMA-INTERFERON is practically the same antidote or anti-substance against pathogens as it is produced by the human immune system itself.it also works in the same way as the natural products in terms of antibodies and defences of the human immune system.

The effect is even better if the drug is taken in larger controlled and appropriate amounts. It is able to prevent almost any disease and to nip it in the bud, even cancer of any kind, because when taken and used in appropriate quantities, it is able to destroy even the most persistent viruses, not to mention less resistant pathogens.

the high consumption of pure yogurt or kefir is the only benefit as of now. because these drugs are not done entirely correctly to work 100%.

9338,fjctd9,Experiments of viral transmission?,"Hi everyone,

I have a very timely question.

The common person has heard of a dozen viruses which are said to cause one or multiple diseases.

And hundreds more can be found in the textbooks.

But . . . did any EXPERIMENT on animals, was able to demonstrate that one of these famous viruses, 'sprayed' into their nose, or onto their tongue, or skin, does lead to the disease which textbooks say it does?

I searched for such experiments a long time ago, and painfully found one, but to my surprise the mouse did not end up with the disease, it just died of septicemia. Septicemia can happen when you bring foreign germs on wounded tissue (as in Semmelweis' hospital some 160 years ago), but that is not the disease itself.

What I'm looking for is: 1 \[dog flu virus on a dog\] --&gt; 2 \[the dog has the flu\] (or other animal/disease)

(Or better, with 20 animals to calculate a rate)

And, if these experiments do happen, why don't we hear more of them? For instance, if we had a group of mice and a few viruses, we could quickly put an end to the haunting debates both in the public and among experts globally, about transmission rates.

I don't want to think there's a conspiracy, I'm just looking for hard evidence of transmission.

P.S.: Experiments not relying on assumptions are preferred. For instance I know there are pharmaceutical trials with humans who are paid to be given a flu strand, after they've received a vaccine. But if they have the flu afterwards, that doesn't prove a positive case of transmission per se (it could be another factor).",0,2020-03-15 20:40:42,biology

9348,fj83dr,Discussion,"Hi guys, I'm a Biomedical Scientist (microbiology) and my knowledge in cell biology is lacking.

I need someones input about Extracellular vesicles (EV).  Can the membrane be modified to introduce specific receptors? is it possible to produce vesicles on demand and what are the life duration?

Basically I have a dug development idea but I lack contacts to reach the relevent companies or RD sections of universities.

The drug idea is mainly dealing with viral infections. For this case the target virus is SARS cov-2 (covid 19)

1. creating a (EV) that has ACE2 receptors or receptor complex used by the target virus for cell entry. 
2. package inside the EV restriction enzymes or endonuclease specific for the virus such as APOBEC3
3. deliver the drug via nebulation

Hypothesis:

the virus will bind to the EV thinking its a cell, begin endocytosis. Once inside the EV, the virus would unpackage its contents in which the enzymes would cleave the viral genome.

We can deliver several thousands of EV to the target site. With other drugs that has shown some activity to SARS cov-19, it can be used as combination therapy.

Immune response to the EV would be low as the ACE2 is human in origin. The survivability of the EV while in the host has to be studied.

This would hopefully lower the viral load allowing host immunity to develope a immune response to fight the infection. This drug would only add time.",3,2020-03-15 15:37:49,biology

Genetic manipulation of other certain genes such as the myostatin gene and ACTA2 as I don't know which specific gene that causes my condition. Stem cell transplantation, tho it would be effective in my case because I can rebuild muscle effectively, it wouldn't change the source of the problem: the Muscle Fiber. Crisper editing of course in the event my current genetic testing comes out positive. Obviously, with exosuits and stuff coming out, people like me will be able to walk more independently. There are also prospects of nanomedicine in the future possibly curing conditions like this. These are kinda fields I want to go in to advance treatments for me and a bunch of others.

9434,fibeku,I have a couple of questions about Biology and school.,"Hi all, this is going to be somewhat of a longer post so I'll try to leave a tl;dr at the bottom.

I'm 21 and not very sure how to go about finding my path in life. I think a lot of people have related/relate to that *especially* at this age. I was class of 2016 and never went off to uni because I wanted to stay home and work to support my family as we've had it pretty bad most of my life. So after HS, it was straight work. I realize now that it was *probably* a very bad idea to do this as it's honestly made me feel like life isn't exciting and I feel like I'm at a dead-end. I want to change that and I want to be happy so I can enjoy life and everything that comes with it. So, I made some choices, cut off some toxic people, I'm working on quitting some bad habits and now I'm here. Trying to decide what EXACTLY I want to do. 

From what I have researched, Biology has a very wide selection of jobs it could lead to and that excites me a lot. I grew up on a smaller farm in Kansas so I have a real love for animals and I know I want them to be apart of something I study. I would really enjoy working with and studying marsupials, but I have no idea where I should start, nor do I know what kind of schooling I would need to do just that. Could somebody break it down for me and tell me where a good starting point would be? When I was in school I never cared to ask about colleges, courses or things that I would need to know about before looking into starting school. I know the timing of this question might be bad with the whole Coronavirus pandemic going on, but while we wait for everything to get situated globally, I'd really like to start trying to plan my life out before I end up regretting the first real part of my adult life.

I'm really into tech, and have been interested in taking things apart and putting random things together since I was a child, so technology has been a big part of my life (my grandfather works at Intel which I find to be pretty neat). So I've been looking into being one of those guys that shoots nature documentaries as well. I feel like it would be the best of both worlds, but as stated above, I've got no idea where to start looking and it's very overwhelming and honestly scary. So does anyone have any tips or pointers?

Thanks for the help, and ***remember to please stay safe and clean out there while this global pandemic is rampant.***

9452,fi6mca,Student Requesting help !,"This text takes minimum 7 minutes to read. Please help out.

Hi, the following long text is just me describing where I am not in life and looking for any type of support, please read every line as I will try to be short and on point as much as possible, follow my text please I need you.

I am a 3rd year student in Faculty of Agriculture, Biotechnology program in Cairo university.

My dream is to treat psychological disorders through tweaking the human microbiota.

Now I have been struggling with low quality education in my program and I am expected to compete with the hulks from universities like AUC (American university in Cairo, MSA, Zewail city) not to mention universities from Abroad. I will list what we have.

What we have are combined in the following brackets (Grading system based on Absolute LUCK, where you get 40% divided into a Mid term exam 5%, Oral 10% where it just depends on whether the professors likes you or not, 20% on practical exam depending on your professor if he/she has any psychological complications to ruin those for you or just a normal being that will test you from whatever he taught in his content, 60% based purely on Final exam that has 0 Excuses and No Retakes and for whatever disastrous reason you missed it for you fail the subject, and also upon failing the subject you get D- whenever you complete it no matter your actual score is. We don’t have retakes or averages or anything that would make us feel that we got more chances to improve upon our mistakes)

60years old wooden benches, 50 years old dirty pipettes and flasks, huge number of students per lab session up to 150 which barely leaves anything for the person to grasp,

Professors with no real demonstration of English proficiency, outdated references “Prescot 2012 taught in Immunology Lectures”,

Courses WITH NO REFERENCES just words that you cannot understand where they came from, that also contradict with other courses,

courses that are not in an organized manner nor in proper depth or level” What I mean is all courses are almost teaching the same thing, where Chemistry course is like biochemistry is like biochemistry 2 and genetics 1 is like Molecular genetics… They all throw just random information that doesn’t correlate to anything nor they are organized enough to help the second course follow from there and finally just not to over stretch it,

Practical sessions that has no meaning at all, as I am currently in my third year and I haven’t even touched a single micro pipette or an actual DNA Kit, I don’t even know what an actual decent level 2 lab would look like as our labs are yellow from how old they are.)

Now what I did to improve so I don’t continue in this demise, I have reached out Reddit and other social networks and they advised me to read the following three references

For Genetics (Watson) for Micro and Immunology (Prescott) for Cell Biology ( Cell biology 6th edition) for Bioinformatics I have got the (Functional genomics by Jonathan). What I did was and “Is being done at the moment.” I have made a study group of students excited as I am so we can encourage each other and we are dividing the books above because we all 1 year left to graduate.

So we all have 7 Courses this semester + 3 books from above (Bioinfo,Immuno,Genetics) + Khan academy to strengthen our ruined and nonexistent algebra and calculus back ground  + Python course on Udemy to jump on the modern boat and become one of the future decent bioinformaticians so I can work on my dream without being blocked with software disabilities that other scientists have complained about.

Now Final part.

I still feel lacking, clueless, I am at this moment applying for 1 internship in Germany and the other is in Spain. I don’t know what to say about myself anymore, I have seen students at my age which is 21 with impressive CVs as it is 3 – 10 pages of achievements and hardcore GPA of 4. My GPA itself is a joke as our grading system is different where for E.g 75% is B- not C- as in other systems, my GPA is 2.61 which is actually B not C. Still I feel like a total loser as everyone else is way !! ahead of me, others are joining internships, projects, competitions, scoring top spots, traveling the world!

I don’t know what to do … If I am doing It right… I am very passionate about my dream, but I have no one to guide me or support me, I have seen students getting guided and encouraged and they all feel worthwhile … I am just getting tired of pushing through it all alone with no clue if Iam even pushing towards the right path!

I have military service for 1 to 3 years (Picked randomly) after I graduate opening even a more terrible gap between me and the other students, HOW CAN I DEVELOP A DECENT RESEARCH CAREER AT A HIGH QUALITY UNIVERSITY with all of this happening ?!

I want to write something decent in my Motivation letter but nothing comes out worthwhile, all my professors think I am special and are all okay with writing me the reference letter, but their English isn’t strong enough to make the reviewer feel like he is dealing with a high quality professor although some of my professors are really good !

Incase you managed to read through it all, thank you. Help me out please… I have always came here on various subreddits seeking help as I have nowhere else to go to…

Note1 EDIT : If any further details are required do let me know please.

Note 2 EDIT: Also one of things that I have done at the current moment is that I have applied for Financial Aid on harvard biochemistry course, as well as Evolutionary genetics course from Duke university as I feel lacking towards both intermediate topics, and my financial aid has been accepted and I will add them to my semester and do my best to balance everything !",4,2020-03-13 15:52:28,biology

We currently have an opening for a job that requires 1 year of prior experience writing trending and non-compliance reports. We got about 10 applications. All 3 of the people with MS degrees immidiately had their applications tossed because they're seen as being over qualified. They didn't even get interviews. Everyone knows they're just sticking their feet into the water and they're going to feel over qualified and move on within a year. We can't keep training new people every year when it takes about 4 months to get up to speed. We need people who are going to stay for 2-3 years, minimum.

The person who's likely to get the job has a BS degree from a no-name liberal arts college. But she's bright, personable, and knows that she doesn't know everything. She also doesn't even have year of experience writing trending and non-compliance reports. She admitted that to us, but told us she would throw her everything into learning everything we would teach her. That showed great initiative, and it's generally assumed by everyone here that once we get her up to speed she'll stay longer than the people with advanced degrees.

9500,fhmfvq,Structural Biologists! How to gain intuition for diffraction,"**Context**: I am a graduate student in a structural biology laboratory. 

**Problem**: Struggling to gain intuition how we building density maps from diffraction data. How to use phases to get from diffraction data to real space. 

**Question**: Does anyone have an approach they took to getting comfort with diffraction data?  A tutorial? A problem?  Are there simple and idealized data sets available to work these problems out by hand to make the bigger problem seem like a sum of this smaller problem?  Do I spend time working on developing signal processing skills?

&amp;#x200B;

**Detail**: Many powerful techniques in structural biology rely on, or can use, diffraction data and reciprocal space to understand structure. For example, just last week I saw a very neat method to use Fourier filtering to remove a crystal lattice artifact observted in cryo-EM data, thereby allowing automated particle picking. Incredibly cool. And crystallography is the most obvious example.

But despite recognizing its importance, I don't think my understanding of diffraction and reciprocal space is nuanced or rigorous enough to take advantage of these powerful techniques. I am in a course on crystallography+EM, but the Professor suggests that everything is now so neatly wrapped into computational packages, that we never dare to get rigorous with structure factors, how to calculate phases, etc. Perhaps these issues have been abstracted away from the modern structural biologist(?), and I am fretting over nothing. But if we might agree there are cases where a deeper intuition for flipping between real and reciprocal space is valuable, might anyone have a path of least resistance to getting to that level of intuition. I have looked at the MIT OCW for signal processing, am taking a course on crystallography, and also have Rupp's Biomolecular Crystallography in hand.

**But if anyone might have other approaches they took, I would be infinitely grateful. I**n CS/ML it seems communities have put together these very clean and intuitive github repositories and jupyter notebook that makes even the most daunting problems seem tractable.

Yes, it’s only a monkey hitting rocks against each other. But the amazing thing is: it’s a monkey hitting rocks against each other! What I’m trying to do with the rest of this post is to give a bit of context to help you see why this is awesome if you don’t see why it is, so keep reading if you’re interested.

Ethoarcheology is a relatively recent development, so recent that google insists on wanting to correct it to ethnoarcheology. As many of you may know, it is no longer taboo to talk about animal culture. We know that some behaviors in non-human species are culturally transmitted and different different even within species, instead specific to communities of individuals. For example, [whales have regional dialects](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/05/110512104252.htm), as do birds, and [the hunting strategies of killer whales](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/understanding-orca-culture-12494696/) is different from group to group.

Well, scientists studying the spatial patterning of chimpanzee artifacts and behavior stumbled upon a legit archaeological sites in Ivory Coast. The kicker being, the stone tools they found in this sites weren’t of human origin : they were the remains of a 4000 year old chimpanzee culture. It quickly became evident that chimpanzee created long-lasting patterns of material cultures, not only with stone tools, but also with nests and plant tools. In fact, there has been some worries that early  archaeology might have falsely attributed sites to early hominin when they were in fact from our cousins.

Which brings us to another country, Brazil, and another species, the bearded monkey or Sapajus libidinosus. In the video we see them smash rocks against each others, but usually they also use these rocks [as hammers and anvils to open cashew nuts](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/04/video-clever-monkeys-adjust-how-hard-they-hammer-nuts). They found a 3 millennia long archaeological site, that breaded monkeys had used to open nuts all this time. This is the first long-term record of tool use in a non-human species.

Interestingly, there is a bit a variation going on. The researchers identify 4 different phases of tool use, depending on the size of the hammers and anvil, what they are made of (sometimes, the anvil is a piece of wood instead of another stone), and the patterns of damages, an indication of how they were used. For example, from around 200 years ago to 30 years ago, they used larger and heavier rocks than either before or after, an evidence that they were using it to open harder food than the cashew to eat now. Did the food source change or their taste ? No one knows, but in either case this means they are able to change which tool they use if they need or want to open different things.

Back to the beginning video. The real kicker is, this is the first evidence of a non-primate species producing large amount of stone flakes. This may seem innocuous, but archaeologist rely heavily on the shape of these flakes [to infer early hominin development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_tool), from Australopithecus to modern humans, so much so that it sometimes helps classifying remains as either habilis or erectus. And now not only is it not reserved to humans, it’s not even reserved to apes. 

Apart from to kick to our ego, the most interesting part to me is that they lick the flakes for some reason. It may very well be for the same unknown reason (ingesting silica, lichen or whatever ?) that our own ancestors started mashing rocks at each other. And only later realized that they could do stuff with the pointy by-products of their smashing, in probably the most important accidental discovery of the history of human history.

On a final sobering note, some authors note that this may be yet again a way in which we screw up these species. By partitioning their habitat to colonize the forests, we fracture these communities and may be preventing cultural transmission when some of it helps animals access food and avoid predators.

9520,fhf5vf,Negative utilitarians believe that we should entirely eliminate suffering including predation in the wild. My response to that is: wouldn't this disrupt the food web and symbiotic relationships? What is the consensus or opinion of biologists/ecologists to this belief?,"Negative utilitarians fairly responded that the idea of nature balancing itself is a myth as many other organisms before humans have caused unprecedented ecological shift; after all, the oxygenation of earth was caused by cyanobacteria. Therefore, human intervention would not be a bad thing from a negative utilitarian perspective. However, these changes happened over a long period of time which enabled gradual adaptation for most animal species. Human interventions, on the other hand, typically change the environment drastically and too fast for adaptation and causing extinctions. We don't know what will happen if we prevent predators from eating their preys and how this could affect the symbiotic relationships of all organisms. 

I admit that I haven't specifically heard negative utilitarians offer alternative answers but I assume that maybe synthetic source of food could be provided to keep animals fed, like how we humans are doing now with creating synthetic meat. But wouldn't this also affect the nutrient cycle? The result from food  chain and food web is decay of organic matters in which the byproducts are used to sustain other lifeforms such as plants, bugs, microorganisms, etc. Since animals aren't dying in the wild, there will be little organic decay and organisms in these habitats will face malnutrition. And since animals aren't dying, wouldn't this also cause overpopulation as we have seen time and time again when predator population in a habitat declined?  To me, preventing or minimising predation for negative utilitarian belief is unpragmatic given the facts. 

What are the opinions of biologists and ecologists on negative utilitarian belief to prevent suffering in nature? Is it practical or let alone doable?",7,2020-03-12 06:55:14,biology

but it got me thinking, got me putting my pinky to my lip like dr evil, forgetting the genetics of such a virus what would be the ultimate virus that would almost certainly result in eventual extinction of the human race with a 50 year period.

my candidate would be HIV like viruses that primarily attacks the cd4 cells but also is able to attack the respiratory tract and cause sneezing, its capsid envelope would gave to be far more hardy and it would have to have a protein on its surface that would allow it to attack the cells in the respiratory tract but it would have to create some sort of response where the human would sneeze it out.

becuase HIV is a slow acting disease coupling it with the ability to be transmitted airbourne and survive in the open environment for far long than it currently does , i would assume you could infect a fuck ton of folk quite quickly especially in city settings.

it would take everyone decades to die also because its slow acting but i reckon humanity would go extinct if something like this existed.

is this a little off, can you think of other ways i legit am interested, (its for fun i know nobody or group has these capabilities so its currently relegated to a thought experiment thank goodness) it doesn't even have to be viral , but it would have to be something that could render our species extinct.

9598,fgn6b9,Teaching Biology,"Hello,

I will be graduating this Spring with my bachelors degree in Biology and I am feeling pretty lost. All my life I've wanted to go into the medical field. I've always had a passion for medicine and I love all that has to do with healthcare, so for most of my life I've wanted to become a doctor. Probably midway into undergrad I really started to discover that being a doctor isn't the only job in medicine, and I fell in love with an allied health career. It's a two year program and much cheaper than going to medical school and it pays very well. The thing is, it's such a tiny field that is so, so competitive that I'm becoming discouraged. I've applied, but all I've gotten are denials. I lack healthcare experience and this is a big one that adcoms are looking for, so I keep applying and applying to whatever jobs I'm qualified for at local hospitals/clinics in my area but so far, nothing. I'm starting to get really, REALLY discouraged. I've been volunteering at a hospital for a few months but I'm not finding it rewarding or relevant to be honest (all I do is restock gloves, no patient interactions. I don't even see the doctors because it's a small unit. I don't feel like I'm learning at all or like this is going to help me and I'm looking at leaving this position and finding something else soon). 

Anyways, while searching online for ideas of what I can do with my degree when I graduate (aside from typical research assistant jig), someone brought up teaching. This isn't something I have ever considered, but looking into it, it might not be too bad of an idea. I like the idea of teaching a subject that I love to kids, and I have some experience with children in the form of volunteering at summer camps and whatnot throughout high school and early college. I enjoy being around kids, but another thing I think about is what other will think. I know it shouldn't matter, but since I was a kid my whole family has known that I wanted to go into medicine, so everyone expects me to. I know my parents will support whatever I chose to do, but they will bring up the fact that this has nothing to do with what I really want and have always wanted to do. I don't know if teaching is something I would do for the rest of my life, and I don't know if having being a science teacher on my resume will help me get into the healthcare field that I really want to try and get into in a few years, but it is something I can see myself doing for a little bit.

I guess my intention with this post is just to get some opinions and advice from others who have been in my position. I have been feeling pretty crappy lately wondering what I'll end up doing with my life.",4,2020-03-10 18:16:13,biology

In 2008 a nerd and another nerd were playing chess. The other guy beat him at chess too many times and the nerd got pissed so he lunged at the other nerd, wrapped his thighs around his neck and choked him until he suffocated.

In 2013 there was a nerdy looking guy and a room mate and the room mate got into an argument with the nerd. The nerdy guy wrestled the room mate to the ground and strangled him with his thighs for 10 minutes until he died from asphyxiation.

In 2014 a 17 year old guy was found strangled in his car. A witness reported he was last seen with 3 stereotypical looking nerds (guys). The bruises on his neck suggested he'd been strangled between ''a set of thighs''.

In 2016 or 2017 a nerd was receiving head from a guy. The nerd got too aroused and ended up tensing his thighs together for 30 minutes without letting up. When he came to he found the other guy slumped over and suffocated.

Nerds also are responsible for like 80% of mass shootings.

(Obligatory context) I love biology but I have just a basic understanding of it as it is not in this year's school program and due to very important exams this year I don't have the time to study alone. 

That being said I need your help. My mother insists that the Corona virus vaccine has been manufactured but is being kept hidden (for whatever reason). All my my arguments have fallen on deaf ears and my not so vast understanding of biology doesn't allow me to go into depth as to why things are the way they are, her most vocal argument is that we have been making vaccines for 200 years so it should take less than a day to make this one (my simple but not technical arguments weren't able to persuade her) 

So I want to ask. What is the process of creating a new vaccine? Why does it usually take so long? And any other information you deem valuable will be grately appreciated.

Is it though? I googled ''air changes per hour'' in stationary, parked cars with the windows rolled up, and the rate in a new model car (car made during the last decade) was something like 0.1, meaning the air gets 're newed' every ten or so hours, which to me seems very low, as the rate for a house is 2-3 times per hour, and a house is a lot more spacious than a car.",2,2020-03-10 13:55:00,biology

THE COLIN LESLIE DEAN SPECIES PARADOX

The first humans Adam and Eve gave birth to Cain and Able
so who did Cain mate with

similarly

who did the first bird mate with who did the first dog mate with

an individual of species A gives birth to a individual of the new species B so who did this new individual of new species B mate with to continue the new species
either

1)there was no one to mate with- so how did the new species B become common

or

2)a whole lot of species A gave birth toa whole lot of new individuals of species B at the same time so that these new individual members of species B could mate together

if this 2) was the way it happened
we have a major problem

it would mean something made a whole lot of members of species A give birth to a whole lot new members of species B at the same time

we are told species form due to random mutations

so

it is beyound possibility that the same random mutation took place in a whole lot of different members of species A at the same time

the other alternative is that some intelligence was at work

NOW
There is a  a dilemma

1)in order to resolve the dean paradox
the dean paradox makes you abandon the word species 
in which case  biology is destroyed

or 

2)biology  uses the word bird 
signifying it is different from its parent organism
science uses the word species

as such

you have the dean paraodox

""There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life""

so basically

without science knowing what life is

then dead and alive have no meaning

biology science dont even know what life is-how ironic they study life but dont know what life is

""Natural selection does not generate new genes/species Natural selection adds no new genetic information as it only deals with the passing on of genes/traits already present and it will be pointed out genetics cannot account for the generation of new species/genes as it is claimed the generation of new genes [via mutation] is a random process due to radiation, viruses, chemicals etc and genetic cannot account for these process happening as they are out side the scope of genetics physics, chaos theory etc may give some explanation but genetics cant""


3) Biologists dont knw what a species is-thus evolution of species is meaninglessness nonsense

9670,ffzeh6,Discussion - Theory: How the recent Coronavirus (nCOVID-19) started,"Disclaimer: This post contains no political conspiracies

Basic points to be used: COVID-19 started spreading a while after the Australian fires have started, COVID-19 causes respiratory problems (similar to smoking plants).

Some of you can already tell where I am heading with this. As mentioned, the coronavirus can cause some respiratory issues, similar to those that result from smoking plants, yet different. As seen through the COVID-19 starting date, it can be correlated with the Australian bushfires, which burned many forms of plants, some of which could contain unidentified substances. It is possible that the combustion of those plants have set of a reaction that have caused either the formation of the virus or solely the spread of it, which can be also correlated to the place where COVID-19 originally started, China, as it could have reached China through different means (fishing boats, cargoes, etc.)

However, there are many gaps in this this theory, such as the fact that the burned plants have not been confirmed and the distance between Australia and China, though it remains possible nonetheless.

I would like to hear any thoughts you have on this theory and encourage you to share your theories in the comments section (preferably nothing specific.

For various reasons, mainly burnout, I am considering mastering out of my bacteriology PhD program. I have my BS in microbiology, and am currently in my second year of my PhD. I have nearly finished all of my classes and the first phase of my qual exams.

As time goes by, it is becoming more and more apparent to me that the PhD might not be worth it. I do not want to be a PI, and I would like to avoid strictly managerial positions. Ideally, I would like to fill a staff scientist or lab manager type of role, in that I would like to continue doing some bench work and would be okay leading a small group of people, but I do not want my own lab in any capacity. I would like to go into industry/R&amp;D, or into the government/military, either keeping in infectious disease/biosecurity research, or going into agricultural, environmental, or clinical research. I just want a 9-5 job with decent pay.

From what I have gathered, it seems that with a PhD in this field, you have two routes to take: academia where you will be a PI, or industry where you will be forced into a managerial role. I have heard that a PhD might overqualify me for the type of job I want, but that a BS/MS only qualifies people for “entry level” roles and that these jobs are hard to get.

Surrounded by academics as I am, it seems to me that my career options are incredibly limited no matter what degree I have. I would like to have a fall-back plan so that I can accurately assess the type of career I can have should I choose to Master out. Is the information I've gathered correct, and would anyone have any guidance/resources to look at that would give me an idea of the types of jobs that would be available to me with a MS vs a PhD?

I have asked this question before on other posts but the answers I got were more general at the time so I have thought a bit more about my career goals and done some more research and I am hoping to get more specific answers today. My question is: should I purse getting a PhD or will a Masters be fine?

I am currently trying the get my BS in Biotechnology and am getting good grades and I have also gotten a job in an oncology lab where I am hoping to get some good research experience so I am hoping to have a competitive application no matter what I decide. I eventually want to go into research in some sort of Biomedical field. I have always planned on getting a PhD but some people have been telling me that it is better to just get a Masters than to pursue the PhD.

I have been told that a Masters degree is fantastic if you want to work in a lab for the rest of your life. You will get good pay and you don't have to slave away for like 6 years at your PhD and then another 3 years in a postdoc position. Plus most PhD graduates are best suited for academia rather than industry, where they may be considered overqualified for entry level positions at a new company (though I have had a harder time believing this one because almost everyone in the lab that I work at has a PhD). On the other hand I have been told that a Masters degree is considered to just be a Bachelors degree with two extra years of experience and you will never get into manager roles without a PhD.

The way that I want my career to go is that I would love to work in a biomedical lab of some kind (I still haven't decided for sure what kind of research I want to do) and I love the idea of being in the lab and performing experiments, but I wouldn't want to be doing that forever, eventually I want to be the one in the office planning out the experiments for the people in the lab to perform rather than always being told what to do. The thought has even crossed my mind of perhaps starting my own research company some day (though that is not much more than distant fantasy). 

So all of that being said, please give me your thoughts on whether it would make more sense to pursue a PhD or if a Masters would due just fine. I have tried to include as much information on what I have thought about already so that you can give me answers to my specific situation rather than general advice.

9718,ffhugt,Looking for Help to remove/report misleading YouTube video about DIY Hand Sanitizer,"I'm looking for some help to report a YouTube video for inaccurate health information. With the global concern of coronavirus increasing many people are looking for ways to make their own hand sanitizer. Of course sanitizer alone is not going to stop coronavirus. But it can be helpful to prevent spread when you don't have access to hand washing. So if a creator is going to make an instructional video regarding sanitizer, I believe they have a responsibility to do it right.

YouTube creators have been jumping on this bandwagon and as a result there are many videos that incorrectly explain how to create an effective hand sanitizer according CDC guidelines ([https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html)). It seems that most people don't understand dilution. They usually start with an appropriate alcohol solution but then mix in too much moisturizer or they are not careful about their measurements and as a result the final concentration is below the recommended minimum of 60% alcohol.

There is a new video trending more than others by Kelly Barlow Creations ([https://youtu.be/RV1bZstVvfw?t=05m40s](https://youtu.be/RV1bZstVvfw?t=05m40s)). Even though there are many videos like it, I thought it was important to try to report this popular video as inaccurate and misleading when it comes health information for creating a hand sanitizer. Basically she recommends starting with 70%-95% alcohol and mixing 2 parts alcohol with 1 part moisturizer. This yields a final concentration below 60% when you start with 70%-90% alcohol. Her recipe only works if you start with 91% alcohol or above.

There are a number of comments on the video explaining that she should edit her video to reflect that her recipe only works with 91% and above. She has replied to many of those comments.. and you would think a reasonable person concerned about people's health would act responsibly. However she has literally called people rude for pointing out the mistake in her video. She has been fighting back by lying that the CDC recommends 40% minimum concentration but when asked to provide a reference she ignores the question. She acknowledges that her concentrations are below 60%, but because the dollar store sells a 37% ""sanitizer"" she decided it's OK for her recipe to be low in concentration (even though she says she is quoting the CDC!). There are dozens of other things she has done wrong, but primarily her recipe is incorrect. Her video about making a ""hand sanitizer"" literally instructs people how to dilute a sanitizer into a ineffective sanitizing solution.

Her video had 40K views when I first saw it on Friday. Now she is up to 150K and climbing fast. So if this seems concerning to you, please help by reporting the video and leaving comments for Kelly to maybe help her understand what she has done wrong. Also commenting would help inform other people who are ignorant and looking for help to avoid the advice in Kelly's video.

Also if you have any advice for me about how to further report this video and others like it, please let me know.  


==============  
Side note: There are basically 4 things that I believe should be emphasized in any DIY hand sanitizer video:  
1: Explain proper hand washing and emphasize that sanitizer should only be used if you don't have immediate access to soap and water.  
2: If using an alcohol solution as your disinfectant explain that the final mixed product must be between 60%-95% alcohol as per the CDC recommendations ([https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html))  
3: Explain dilution. If you start with a 70% alcohol solution (which is an effective disinfectant on its own) and you mix 2 parts alcohol to 1 part moisturizer then your final solution contains only 2/3 of the original 70% alcohol (which is 46%, way below the recommended minimum).  
4: Apply enough hand sanitizer so that you still see it on your hands after 20 seconds. Alcohol evaporates quickly and it's effectiveness only approaches 99% if it remains on a surface (your skin) for over 20 seconds.",26,2020-03-08 14:43:08,biology

In a review i read about using adenoviral vectors for the correction of the del508 that causes CF, they point out that adenoviral vectors would not be useful for correcting the del508 mutation in basal stem cells, since the virus is not integrated into the genome and the corrected gene will not be present in the apical cells that differentiate from the stem cells. 

It's an older article so im unsure whether they are considering that the virus could encode the Cas9 protein as well as gRNA. Am i right to assume that if you were to encode the Cas9 protein and the gRNA, that Cas9 then would be able to make a permanent change in the genome, which would mean that the corrected gene would also be present in the apical cells that differentiate from the stem cells? Or is there any other mechanisms that causes this to not be possible, that they don't point out?

Why would they be faked? For what reason? I don't see any problem with these articles and there are hundreds of separate news stories from different years and news sources (including reputable news sources) of the same type of event.

My friend posted them in a sub to warn people not to sleep in modern cars with the windows rolled up and the vents off because modern cars lack adequate passive air exchange and a person will use up air faster than its replenished, and everyone was downvoting them saying the news articles are all fake. Why?

My friend clarified that cars are not airtight but that doesn't mean that a person can't use up oxygen in the car faster than new oxygen comes into the car.

CO2 poisoning is another factor as well and can kill much quicker than oxygen deprivation can, as well. If there's poor air exchange because modern cars are more tightly sealed than older cars, toxic levels of CO2 could feasibly build up over time.

I'm studying for an upcoming ecology exam and my laptop died in the middle of a lecture and missed some notes. I'm a little unsure about an example given in class. Any help would be appreciated! 

1.) Which community could have the highest Simpson's reciprocal index? (N=total individuals in community, S=number of species in the community (species richness)) ; equation for Simpson's reciprocal index (D): D= **Σ**pi\^2 (where pi=relative abundance of a species in the community) ; Simpson's reciprocal index=1/D

a) Community 1: N=1000; S=5 

b) Community 2: N=1000; S=20 

c) Community 3: N=500; S=25 

* It's my understanding that having information about the relative abundance for each species would be needed to calculate this. With the ""could"" I would have guessed that community 3 might given that there are more species. I'm thinking this could have been a trick question where ""need more information"" is the best answer but I don't remember what she said about this and that wasn't an answer choice.

I won't bore you with my whole long, sad backstory, but briefly for those interested: I got my BS and non-thesis based MS in 2014 and have worked a variety of biological related jobs, but pretty much haven't been in a lab since undergrad. I did 4 semesters in a few different labs in undergrad, but nothing particularly noteworthy. 

I just accepted an offer for a neuroscience research lab at a university as a research assistant 3, and I'm pretty much equal parts excited and terrified. The PI seems great and knows I'm not coming in as a lab genius, but said I seem ""very teachable"" which I feel like is the best compliment I could get in my situation lol. It's a tiny group with only 3 people total, and I'll also be split about 80-20 between 2 labs because they both kind of wanted someone part time, but the other ""lab"" is just one PI by himself. It's by far the best salary I've ever had, and at this point I am looking to begin a career in research and stick with this route long term. I'm not planning to pursue a PhD, but I am looking into possibly doing an MBA, which I can also do for free at this school after 6 months.    
They're looking for someone to do a lot of cell culture work, so that's gonna be me. I have a lot of bacterial culture experience but no mammalian. And they use mouse models, spinal cord injury specifically, which honestly kind of worries me because I have a background in animal husbandry. I think it'll be fine, but I'm afraid it might wear me down over time.

But anyway I'd love some insight to help me stop freaking out as much. (I know that wasn't very brief after all, sorry)",7,2020-03-07 20:29:47,biology

9793,feqc29,At what point in evolution did animals start to eat each other?,"At what point in evolution did animals start to eat each other? (SCIENCE ONLY)

Note: i tried Googling this question and for some reason, a good amount of the results came from Christian websites. I am a firm believer in evolution and do not think “god did it” is a solid answer. SCIENTIFIC/EVOLUTIONARY ANSWERS ONLY!

Anyways, here is what I want to know: I believe that life as we know it evolved from a single-celled organism billions of years ago. These organisms reproduced through mitosis over and over until they started to float to the surface of the ocean, where they learned photosynthesis and eventually became plants. But of course, not all of them evolved into plants. Others stayed in the ocean and evolved into other life forms that eventually became fish and such. I read that these organisms used a process called chemosynthesis to convert inorganic molecules into simple sugars, which is what bacteria would eat.

So this means that the first living things were self sufficient in that they were able to create their own food and also reproduce asexually. So at what point in evolution did it become beneficial for organisms to eat the flesh of another to survive? How did we, as living beings, go from photo/chemosynthesis and mitosis to eating mostly meat and plants?",7,2020-03-06 22:50:57,biology

I really enjoy learning about the theory and I understand academic papers and protocols no problem, though I’ve been finding the actual laboratory experiments really difficult.

To cut a long story short, my data has been mostly unusable. Despite intense concentration on each part of each experiment, my error bars are huge and in some instances the experiment generates no usable data at all. The same experiments have been repeated by another PhD student, who generated usable data with tight error bars.  For context, experiments are qRT-PCR and Western blots. I had a previous 8 week stint in the labs last year, where I generated some tissue culture data, again inconsistent and plagued my operator error.

I’m feeling really disheartened by all of this. Each time I’ll finish an experiment and think it’s gone well, only to realise later that any data is overshadowed by operator error. I was hoping to incorporate research into my career, though everything is telling me that I’m just not able to do these types of experiments.

I'm very active in 3D printing and one issue that keeps coming up is how unsuitable 3D printed objects are for food related stuff. The saying goes that because 3D printed surface is made up of small layers, it's much more porous and therefore an ideal place for microbes to grow. This also supposedly makes the surface much harder to clean compared to traditional cookware.

I'd really love to do a test comparison, where I'd print something and use it as a food container. I'd also do the same with a plastic food box. After cleaning both, I'd like to somehow test if the 3D printed surface did indeed retain more microbes, or if it's more susceptible to microbe growth vs a plastic box or a cutting board.

I've seen a few $25 ""bacteria growth kits"" on Amazon, using petri dishes with agar, but I have no idea how reliable those are.

So my question is more or less this; is there a feasible way that I could test something like this at home, without spending hundreds on proper test kits? Is there a service offered somewhere that could do the tests for me?

I'm writing an assigment on CF, and i'm wondering about something i read in a review article (doi:10.1016/j.gendis.2018.11.005). It is written that when attempting to correct the mutated CFTR-gene in the lungs with genetic therapies, and obtain long term expression, you would have to correct the gene in the basal (stem cells) rather than the apical epithelial cells, since they have a high turnover rate, compared to the basal cells, that differentiate into the epithelial cells. In this context, terminal cell differentiation is mentioned. 

Wikipedia has the following explanation of terminal cell differentiation: ""*During terminal differentiation, a precursor cell formerly capable of cell division, permanently leaves the cell cycle, dismantles the cell cycle machinery and often expresses a range of genes characteristic of the cell's final function (e.g. myosin and actin for a muscle cell)*.

9859,fe7wb0,A question about the human physiology — differences in amylase activity for different ethnic groups?,"&gt; Three groups of people were examined for how much amylase they had in their saliva. The amylase activity was indicated as units per cm3 of saliva. Below is a description showing the three different peoples, what their diet consists of and their measured amylase activity.

&gt; The people of Tswana from South Africa had a diet consisting of carbohydrates derived from sorghum and corn. Sometimes they use small amounts of milk and meat. They only eat fruits and vegetables during the harvest season. The amylase activity was 248/cm\^3.

&gt; Then the population of Europeans, fed on a mixed diet was examined, and the amylase activity was 101/cm3.

&gt; Bushmen from the Kalahari Desert were mainly fed on birds, lizards, snakes, and insects. They also ate small amounts of roots and other plants. The amylase activity was 22/cm\^3.

1. **How can these differences be explained, are there any hypothesis that supports the explanation, and can one apply a method to get a reason for this?**

&gt; If we take it a step further and then say that some of these bushmen get a diet consisting of potatoes, flour, beans, and meat, thus, more carbohydrates than they are used to in some, and the amylase activity rises to about 100 units/cm\^3.

2. **What would the previous hypotheses provide in support of this new information that we get?**

***

# Here's what I think

This is/would be definitive proof that the Amylase activity is linked to diet and not to ethnicity.

&gt;some of these bushmen get a diet consisting of potatoes, flour, beans, and meat, thus, more carbohydrates than they are used to in some, and the amylase activity rises to about 100 units/cm3

It seems pretty obvious (now), that the hypothesis is:

""Given this information, is the difference in amylase activity in these different ethnic groups due to genetic adaptation or due to the specific diet? Does eating carbohydrates upregulate amylase production?""

But I am wondering why it is the case that the amylase activity is so high. Does genes play a role? The questions are manifold.

For questions like this, would it be better to rather than discuss it as if it is real data? Or that the point is a mental exercise looking at evolutionary vs environmental changes to the human physiology? And the point being to determine whether the amylase levels are something that has evolved due to diet or something that is adaptable based on diet?

In the first case, the levels would not change in a population if the diet was changed in the short term. In the other, a change in levels would be expected, as the body adjusted to the change in diet, because the level would not be set by evolution.

Can we say that the diet modifies the amount of amylase produced?

Is a good method for validation to give carbs to some of the bushmen, and less carb to the Tswana? To see if amylase expression level changes? By being given the results, one could say that the hypothesis is validated. One other answer (although it is not elegant) might be that if it was due to ethnicity, you'd expect it to be linked to a DNA sequence change. You might just sequence the appropriate gene, looking for SNP.

Could the evolved amylase levels be based on historic diet? I.e. explaining why many of European descent have lactose tolerance while most Chinese have lactose intolerance, because Chinese historically did not consume dairy?

9876,fe3isi,[Grade 12 Biology: Photosynthesis] Light wavelength significance for photosynthesis?,"**I am writing an analysis based on a theoretical lab report made by other ''students,'' and for the lab they were going to experiment on 'the amount of light and the wavelength of light.' and its significance for photosynthesis. I wrote the theory part below but I am not sure if I should elaborate on anything in particular, or if something is redundant, irrelevant, etc.**

**I want the theory to be factual and relevant, that is, for it to explain the theories needed to explain and analyze the result in the discussion, also for it to include concepts and phenomena and explain them in-depth and correct way.. thoughts?**

**THEORY:**

&gt;Most of the energy that hits the earth comes from the sun; this energy comes in the form of electromagnetic radiation that has a wide wavelength spectrum. This radiation is light that is very important for photosynthesis, and consists of photons that are electromagnetic waves, which in turn is the product of the vibration that arises between the electric field and the magnetic field.  
In the leaves of the plants are chloroplasts which in turn contain the dye chlorophyll, a green pigment, which is found in photosynthetic organisms and is common to all photosynthetic cells, and are the light-absorbing molecules that absorb only specific wavelengths of light, while other wavelengths are reflected. Why we see chlorophyll as green plants is because chlorophyll reflects green light.  
Chlorophyll is surrounded by its own membrane, the lumen, and is in addition to the inner and outer membranes of the chloroplasts the third membrane. It is within the membrane of the thylakoids that the light-dependent reaction of photosynthesis takes place. The chlorophyll dye found in the leaves of plants absorbs red and blue light as they have an effect in photosynthesis and contain a large amount of energy.  
Light-capturing reactions are dependent on the energy from the photons of light trapped by chlorophyll, along with the enzymes contained within the inner membrane of the chloroplast. In chloroplasts, the gross reaction, called photosynthesis, occurs with this chemical reaction:  
6C02 + 12H20 + light energy -&gt; C6H1206 + 602 + 6H20  
In other words, the gross reaction is between carbon dioxide, dihydric oxide or water, and light energy, from which we get a product of an energy-rich sugar, oxygen, and dihydric oxide or water. The gross reaction coordinates two different processes under the same designation - the photosynthesis - which in turn consists of many partial reactions. The two processes are partly the light reactions and the carbon dioxide binding reactions.  
When the light is absorbed by chlorophyll, its energy is utilized to split water into oxygen, electron, and hydrogen ions using the enzymes contained in the chloroplasts. Light energy is supplied to energy carriers, or reduced hydrogen carriers ATP and NADPH2, and we get the by-product oxygenated. It takes a lot of energy to produce ATP and NADPH, but the energy carriers have an effect because there is the energy they carry that is not stored, but is transferred in energy-demanding reactions. The hydrogen ion concentration which has been increased within the lumen is utilized by ATP synthase to produce ATP which is later used in the non-light-dependent reaction to produce sugars when ATP is short-lived in the cell and is considered the cell's energy source.  
The dark reaction, or Calvin cycle, occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts, which is the space between the thylakoids. During the Calvin cycle, there is carbon dioxide which is bound to a five-carbon sugar which decomposes into two charcoal sugars, which are then reduced and charged with energy using energy-rich compounds such as ATP and NADPH from the light reaction. These are stored if possible in order to form energy-rich sugars and other energy-rich compounds and pentose. Carbon dioxide-binding reactions occur when light but do not depend on light, such as light-capturing photosynthesis.  
Generally, there are five main types of chlorophyll, chlorophyll a and b are the most important pigments for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a is found in algae and cyanobacteria, while chlorophyll b is found in green algae and plants. The pigment molecules together with proteins are used to form a chemical structure called a photosystem, the photosystem contains proteins and captures energy-rich photons through the chlorophyll contained in the photosystem.  
The atmosphere's concentration of carbon dioxide is below the level most favorable for photosynthesis, but with the combustion of fossil fuels the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rapidly increased. This results in an increased rate of photosynthesis which leads to the excess carbon dioxide being converted into various sugars. Without the plants, the carbon content of the atmosphere would increase much faster and global warming increase even more. By measuring how fast it is possible to absorb carbon dioxide, or how fast carbohydrates are formed, or how fast oxygen is released, we can determine the rate of photosynthesis. This speed is characterized, among other things, by the brightness and availability of carbon dioxide. It can be stated that the change in photosynthesis rate is relative to the wavelength, which can be obtained by measuring the photosynthesis rate when illuminating a plant with light of different wavelengths, but that they also have the same energy content. Short-wave radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet light, contains more energy than long-wave radiation.  
Theoretically, the light intensity should not be as effective in connection with the growing distance from which the lamp emits its light to the beaker. It is said that the light intensity has an inverse proportion to the square of the distance; thus, this is the inverse square law. Thus, it can be described as: I ∝ 1 / d2, where d stands for the distance in the unit meter, I stands for the light intensity with the unit W / m2, where W stands for watts or energy per second, and where ∝ stands for proportion.",0,2020-03-05 16:38:59,biology

9898,fdv8qs,[Grade 12 Biology: Bacteria and virus] Help me with this question please!,"1. Describe how a virus proliferates and spreads, and explain as thoroughly as you can why a doctor does not prescribe antibiotics against these invaders.

A virus propagates by entering a host cell. It starts by the virus attaching to the host cell and then enters it, then the virus releases its nucleic acids in the form of DNA to initiate replication. We then go into the process called protein synthesis when the virus needs its new proteins. We thus have virus propagation by forming new virus particles called virions. For plants, the process occurs by the virus entering its host (the plant) through a hole in the cell wall, and this can have several causes such as insect damage. Similarly, this happens in humans as well, and many died during the First and Second World Wars due to viral infection that spread through injuries to the body of the war and there were no cures for these diseases either.

The doctor does not prescribe antibiotics for viruses because it is used in cases of infections with bacteria and fungi, however, it has no effect on viruses. Viral infections can in most cases be treated / prevented with vaccine agents. Another side effect of treating with antibiotics is that we get bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic, which makes it much more difficult to treat an infection. Once the body gets too many resistant bacteria against the antibiotic, this can be passed on to other people and then there are certainly big problems to get rid of this infection.

One reason why doctors also doubt about treating with antibiotics is because the body has bacteria that go into the normal flora category and help the body against infection and degradation of our food. When you take these antibiotics, the body will lose these benign bacteria.",2,2020-03-05 07:28:27,biology

&gt;The innate immune defense is part of the immune system and consists of the outer and inner defense. Unlike the adaptive immune system, or the acquired immune system, the innate immune system is very rapid and activates rapidly in response to an infection. The innate immune system, in turn, activates the innate immune system which has a much higher sensitivity to different types of infectious agents. The innate immune system recognizes only a limited number of microbes, while the adaptive immune system can produce antibodies and T cells against almost all types of antigens that exist. However, the adaptive defense is slow and may take weeks to develop a complete response.

2. Explain and exemplify catabolic and anabolic processes?   

&gt;Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Catabolism breaks down large molecules (such as polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins) into smaller units (such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids, respectively). **Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism, whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect.** Cells use the monomers released from breaking down polymers to either construct new polymer molecules, or degrade the monomers further to simple waste products, releasing energy. Cellular wastes include lactic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and urea. The creation of these wastes is usually an oxidation process involving a release of chemical free energy, some of which is lost as heat, but the rest of which is used to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This molecule acts as a way for the cell to transfer the energy released by catabolism to the energy-requiring reactions that make up anabolism. (Catabolism is seen as destructive metabolism and anabolism as constructive metabolism). Catabolism therefore provides the chemical energy necessary for the maintenance and growth of cells. Examples of catabolic processes include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the breakdown of muscle protein in order to use amino acids as substrates for gluconeogenesis, the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to fatty acids, and oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters by monoamine oxidase.

How can A fully be rid of the virus if more keeps getting coughed into his face? I see that reinfection for the coronavirus at least is either due to not having enough antibodies yet or due to the virus possibly being biphasic.

I thought that logically A would stay sick if B, whose condition isn’t improving, constantly coughs in his face, but my friend with a PhD in biology told me that A’s illness wouldn’t be affected by B because it would be an insignificant number of viruses and also because A’s body is already fighting the viruses.

b) Explain by means of the graphs above the effect of the lack of mitochondria on the yeast cells.

\---------

**MY ANSWER:**

&gt;b) Population 1 cannot respire, because they lack mitochondria. They do however produce ATP, but don't consume oxygen. Small amounts of ATP are created during glycosis, without needing to have any mitochondria. The ATP production occurs in the cytoplasm of the yeast, this explains why there is ATP being created in graph D. Population 1 has very little energy for regular functions, including reproduction, which explains why their population is stagnating after 6 minutes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Population 2 is able to respire and as such consume oxygen and have enough energy.  
Additionally, yeasts are facultative anaerobes. It can live in the presence and also absence of the O2. In the presence of the O2 they can use O2 and undergo aerobic respiration. In the absence of the O2, they undergo anaerobic respiration, and simply ""ferment"" relying on the energy of glycolysis for growth.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In graph C, it is showing that the level of O2 remains same when the yeast has no mitochondria. When the yeast is having mitochondria, it is utilizing O2 and producing energy through aerobic respiration. So O2 level is reducing.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;In graph D, yeast not having mitochondria produces much less ATP and the yeast with mitochondria produces a lot of ATP. The yeast which lacks mitochondria produces less than 40 micro-moles/L of energy in 7 minutes. The ATP levels rise from 2.5 minutes to 7 minutes reaching slightly less than 40 micro moles /l.

9934,fdk99x,[AP Bio] Light wavelength significance for photosynthesis?,"**I am writing an analysis based on a theoretical lab report made by other ''students,'' and for the lab they were going to experiment on 'the amount of light and the wavelength of light.' and its significance for photosynthesis. I wrote the theory part below but I am not sure if I should elaborate on anything in particular, or if something is redundant, irrelevant, etc.**

**I want the theory to be factual and relevant, that is, for it to explain the theories needed to explain and analyze the result in the discussion, also for it to include concepts and phenomena and explain them in-depth and correct way.. thoughts?**

&amp;#x200B;

**THEORY:**

&gt;Most of the energy that hits our planet comes from the sun, and this is energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation over a large wavelength spectrum. The light that hits the earth is very important for photosynthesis. Leaf dyes such as chlorophyll and carotene capture energy from the light and absorb red and blue light as they have a great effect on photosynthesis. These dyes are called pigments and are found in photosynthetic organisms, these pigments being the light-absorbing molecules that absorb only specific wavelengths of light, while reflecting other wavelengths. Chlorophyll is a green pigment that is common to all photosynthetic cells, and reflects green light while absorbing other wavelengths, which explains why most of us can see a plant as green.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Generally, there are five major types of chlorophyll, chlorophyll a, b, c, d as well as a molecule found in prokaryotes and called bacterial chlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and b are the most important pigments for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is found in algae and cyanobacteria, while chlorophyll b is found in green algae and plants. Chlorophyll is found in the thylakoids of the chloroplasts, which are surrounded by its own membrane, the lumen, and is in addition to the inner and outer membranes of the chloroplasts, the third membrane, and it is within the thylakoids that the photosynthetic light-dependent reaction takes place. The pigment molecules, together with proteins, are used to form a chemical structure called a photosystem. Each photosystem contains proteins and captures energy-rich photons through the chlorophyll contained in the photosystem. The energy is then used to break down water into oxygen, electron and hydrogen ion. The hydrogen ion concentration, in turn, becomes higher within the thylakoid membrane, or lumen in other words. Further, ATP synthase utilizes these hydrogen ions to produce ATP, which is later used in the non-light dependent reaction. ATP is the cell's energy source, but is rather short-lived in the cell and is therefore used to produce sugar.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;By measuring how fast it is possible to absorb carbon dioxide, or how fast carbohydrates are formed, or how fast oxygen is released, we can determine the rate of photosynthesis. This speed is characterized by the brightness, as well as the availability of carbon dioxide. It can be noted that the change in photosynthesis rate is relative to wavelength, which can be obtained by measuring photosynthesis rate when illuminating a plant with the light of different wavelengths, but that they have the same energy content. Short-wave radiation, such as X-rays and ultraviolet light, contains more energy than long-wave radiation.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Theoretically, the light intensity should not be as effective in connection with the growing distance from which the lamp emits its light to the beaker. It is said that the light intensity has an inverse proportion to the square of the distance; thus, this is the inverse square law. Thus, it can be described as: I ∝ 1 / d2, where d stands for the distance in the unit meter, I stands for the light intensity with the unit W / m2, where W stands for watts or energy per second, and where ∝ stands for proportion.",0,2020-03-04 15:38:32,biology

Diphosphane ignites at 38 C which is extremely close to body temperature so a combination of diphosphane production + high temperature (ie from a fever or drinking a hot drink, eating a hot food) causes the gut to ignite and the abdomen to split open.

Additionally, in the discussion I didn't present well-founded and nuanced arguments and give a detailed and nuanced account of the consequences of several positions, and didn't highlight relevant new question at issues that will guide the discussion forward**

My answer:

&gt;The nervous system causes information to be disseminated to the brain by means of the nerves in the body that send signals to the brain in the form of electrical stimulation, what can be sent to the brain is that in case you are injured, the nerves signal to the brain that you have been damaged itself. The nervous system consists of two parts, which are central and peripheral. The brain and spinal cord form the central nervous system, and there are various parts of the brain that cooperate with the nerves. The peripheral nervous system is the nerves found in the body that connect to the brain and spinal cord and consists of the motor and sensory nerves, motor nerves are the nerves that are connected to muscles, and sensory nerves convey signals from the sensory organs to our brain.  
The hormone system is glands (e.g., thyroid glands, ovaries/testicles) that form substances that signal and send information in the body and are transported with the blood. The hormone system determines a person's growth, metabolism, sex drive, reproduction. Examples of hormones may be cortisol, which is produced in the adrenal glands in stressful situations and causes blood pressure and pulse to rise and the trachea to open more, leading to the body being ready to handle dangerous situations where life is in danger. An important part of the hormone system is the pituitary gland that controls the remaining glands and its hormone production and which sits in a small part of the brain, and because the pituitary gland forms its hormones, the remaining glands are stimulated to produce their hormones. It is said that hormones only affect certain cells and act as chemical information signals. In the testes, men have their sex hormones, and that is necessary for men to develop the genitals, the hormone that develops there is called testosterone while the woman has her hormones in the ovaries and there she has her estrogen, the female hormones.  
The communication systems are important because one needs to know the body's need for survival, and this is where the hormone and nervous systems help by sending signals from and to the brain, for example, Are hungry and need food or you are injured, the body must quickly send white blood cells to fight potential infections. For example, cortisol is important to produce in potential danger while the brain signals the heart to pump blood faster via cortisol to send oxygen-rich blood to the muscles in order to strain them in anticipation of a potential threat to a dangerous animal. The peripheral nervous system helps man to move joints and muscles, and from this, you can move, see things around and interpret things with the organs of the senses.  
The nervous and hormone systems have the same origin because the nervous system records the body that is exposed to and the hormones help to solve any problems the body is exposed by secreting important hormones that prepare the body for dangers such as the hormone cortisol, for example, everything that affects the nervous system causes a release of different hormones, and it is important that there is a balance with these hormones or else you can have problems in the body.",0,2020-03-04 12:35:35,biology

Before the trial, as well as immediately after and for 20 minutes ahead, blood tests were taken in the arm of both students. The lactate levels in the blood were analyzed and plotted in a diagram.

a) What happens in the muscles of Sofia and Carl?

b) Which curve in the diagram do you think is Sofia's and Carl respectively? Motivate your answer.

c) What weaknesses do you see with the experiment?

**My HS teacher for AP Bio graded me highly in my answer for a) and b), but graded it low for answer c). Said that I need to** ***highlight several weaknesses to the experiment, and justify them in a detailed way with relevant terminology.***

**My answer:**

&gt;a) At work, the muscles need oxygen in the cells, and this happens when Sofia and Carl get to work with the muscles. The oxygen gets the muscles through the capillaries or blood vessels, which supply the muscles with oxygen-rich blood from the heart. It may happen that the muscles need oxygen when there is not much oxygen left to supply the muscles; this means that the muscles work anaerobically. In this case, lactic acid is formed, which leads to pain in the working muscle, and you have to rest to get the oxygen needed. Since Carl performs static work without any mobility in the body, the muscles that work easily get lactic acid, as Carl sits all the time tensely in the abdomen and thigh muscles; this means that oxygen-rich blood cannot reach the muscle cells so easily through the blood vessels. As Sofia does dynamic work, i.e., a moving job, it happens that the muscles relax and work on and off as she rests on each leg between the steps, this is good for blood circulation and reduces the capacity to form lactic acid.  
&gt;  
&gt;b) The gray curve stands for Carl because with reference to the answer to a) I pointed out that lactic acid is most easily formed in static work, and this we can see when the lactate concentration becomes higher during the work (20 mmol / L at 3 min), and that lactate concentration is lower for dynamic work that applies to Sofia (13mmol / L at 3 min). What is interesting to point out is that the lactic acid concentration quickly increased most with Carl as he performs static work. This means that the muscles prevent oxygen-rich blood from reaching the muscle cells, which we see after work done when the lactate concentration more than doubles between 2-3 minutes in the gray curve. Sofia has less tendency to get such a high lactate concentration as the muscles work and relax during dynamic work, and the blood circulation works properly without being tense.  
&gt;  
&gt;c) Weaknesses that I can see with the experiment may be that before work, one can see that the lactate concentration varies, for example, Carl (gray) has 2 mmol / L while Sofia (black) has 3 mmol / L in the blood. Then Sofia has more lactate concentration 10mmol / L at 0 min while Carl has 4mmol / L, it is not clear why they have that amount of lactate in the blood, unless this means that they have this lactate concentration from the first second of work, i.e., between 1-60sec. At 10 min you can see that the lactate concentration for Carl is higher than at 5 min, and we know why this happens, namely because as long as the exercise is in progress, the lactate concentration remains in the legs, when Carl relaxes it is released into the blood instead. At the same time, the lactate concentration decreases slightly in Sofia at 10 min, from 9.5 mmol / L at 5 min to 8.5 mmol / L at 10 min. 10 min after at 20 min you can see that the lactate concentration is very similar, but for some strange reason Carl lactate concentration stayed in similar levels at 10 min compared to 5 min, while the 10 min later at 20 min decreases to 4.5 mmol / L at the same time as Sofia has 5mmol / L and decreased by almost half from 10 minutes to 20 minutes. In addition, we do not know if both individuals have light (fast) or red (slow) muscle fibers, since red muscle fibers have many mitochondria, which means that there is good blood supply while the light muscle fibers have fewer mitochondria and poor blood supply. The slow muscle fibers work mostly with oxygen and can work for a long time without forming lactic acid, but white muscle fibers need glucose to break down in order to work in cases where no oxygen is available, which leads to lactic acid when working without oxygen.",2,2020-03-04 10:53:47,biology

**Abstract**

Species of this genus have several adaptations against phytophages: cells walls contain silicate crystals \[SiO4\]^(4 -) as in sand.

**Article**

^(Kingdom:)	*Plantae* ; ^(Clade:)	Tracheophytes ; ^(Class:)	*Polypodiopsida* ; ^(Subclass:)	*Equisetidae* ; ^(Order:)	*Equisetales* ; ^(Family:)	*Equisetaceae* ; ^(Genus:)	*Equisetum*.   
Silicon is a major part of the Cell Wall and Equisetum actively accumulates Si. It also accumulates heavy metals like Copper, Gold &amp; Silver. It has been used as an indicator plant for heavy metal contamination &amp; for prospecting.  ..meristematic cells are located at the Node. Such cells are structurally weak... A solid septum is found at the Nodes. Epidermal cells have thick Cutenized walls. The surface is rough due to the presence of Silicon. Equisetum is the only genus of plants which preferentially *use Silicon for cell wall strengthening.* The Cortex contains ridges of Sclerenchyma... Chlorenchyma is abundant... Cells in the Outer Wall of the Sporangia have Helical Thickenings. \[1\]  
The stems of horsetail contain 5% to 8% silica and silicic acids. The plant contains about 5% of a saponin called equisetonin, as well as the flavone glycosides isoquercitrin, equisetrin, and galuteolin.Tyler 1987 The sterol fraction of E. arvense contains beta-sitosterol, campesterol, isofucosterol, and trace amounts of cholesterol.D'Agostino 1984 The alkaloid nicotine is present in minute amounts (less than 1 ppm),Tyler 1987 but may account for a portion of the pharmacologic activity of the plant. The plant contains more than 15 types of bioflavonoids, as well as manganese, potassium, sulfur, and magnesium.Bisset 2001, Lininger 1998 The cytokinin isopentenyladenosine has been identified in fertile fronds.Yamane 1983. \[2\]  
The question remains: **What adaptations are for phytophages whose diets consist of said plants?**

9967,fdacil,"Describe antibiotics, explain how it works and discuss what problems there are regarding the use of this drug.","Describe antibiotics, explain how it works and discuss what problems there are regarding the use of this drug. Remember to raise the issue from several different perspectives.

&gt;Antibiotics are used to treat infections that have been caused by bacteria, but the infections can also occur as a result of viruses or fungi, which is when antibiotics do not work. How antibiotics work is by stopping the reproduction of the bacteria and destroying them, usually white blood cells in our immune system attack the infections but usually, it is not enough which is when antibiotics are needed. How antibiotics work is by destroying the bacterial cell walls, and the bacteria that are reproduced by cell division die because they do not get their cell walls, which in short explains that antibiotics stop the bacterial proliferation. The problem today with antibiotics is that the bacteria in the body can become resistant to the antibiotic; in addition, antibiotics can kill good bacteria found in the intestines. Why the bacteria can cope with antibiotics if they do not die when taking the antibiotic is that the bacteria become resistant as the bacteria adapt to the attacks but then become immobile. In addition, antibiotic-resistant bacteria can transfer their DNA or plasmids, to other bacteria found in the bloodstream... There are also other problems with antibiotics today when you give these medicines to live animals that we then eat so that they do not have any diseases, that is the meat from chicken and cats that you eat that can also contain traces of antibiotics, maybe to and with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition, it is important not to take antibiotics for long because you want to maintain good bacteria in the intestines, called probiotics or intestinal flora, and that helps us with the anaerobic oxidation of carbohydrates and form lactic acid to make it difficult for bad bacteria to put its territory there. Another advantage of having the good bacteria is that, for example, in the large intestine, the bacteria make use of the nutrients that our enzymes have not been able to break down, and as the bacteria break down these nutrients carbon dioxide is formed which is absorbed to some extent by the large intestine but which also comes out through the rectum. So, the problem people can have if antibiotics destroy these good bacteria is that they can then get an infection in the gut and even suffer from diarrhoea because if good bacteria are not present, bad bacteria from the food can settle in the intestines instead which can cause complications for humans.

In the explanation, include where these sub-processes occur and what products are formed in connection with the different sub-reactions.","1. Describe in detail the three sub-processes in the cell's energy recovery that result in the formation of ATP in our cells. In the explanation you should include where these sub-processes occur and what products are formed in connection with the different sub-reactions.

&gt;Plants absorb carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates in the form of potatoes, rice and wheat or fruits and vegetables. These carbohydrates are sugar, in the form of glucose, and when we eat it, you get ATP formation in the cells to help with cellular respiration. Here's how it works: When we get glucose, we end up in a phase called glycolysis that breaks down glucose to form 2 molecules of pyruvic acid, and this occurs in cell plasma in both animal and plant cells. During cell respiration, oxygen from the environment is used to convert pyruvate into three molecules of carbon dioxide while storing energy during this process, which is ATP. In the citric acid cycle, you can also get ATP, and this happens in the mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the CO2 of the pyruvic acid from glycolysis is needed to form molecules with two carbon atoms, and coenzyme a is coupled to CO2 and then called acetyl-CoA. Now that we have acetyl-CoA, the citric acid cycle begins where the acetyl group is coupled with oxalacetic acid with its 4 carbon atoms, and finally, we get citric acid with 6 carbon atoms. Enzymes in the body then help break down the citric acid into oxalacetic acid again and two molecules of CO2, in the same vein, the hydrogen atoms are released to 4 hydrogen carriers and energy to the ATP molecule for each turnover on the pyruvic acid molecule. The citric acid cycle continues in this way as long as one has access to pyruvic acid through glucose.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;During the electron transport or the breathing chain, etc., you can also get ATP. This, with the help of oxygen. The electron transport takes place in a mitochondrial membrane, of which there are then proteins that have electrons at their disposal and can move them, hydrogen atoms that you get from the citric acid cycle can be used for the electron transport when hydrogen carriers give these hydrogen atoms to the proteins in the form of the e- (electron) and H + charges. (proton). The electrons are sent to the proteins to run out of oxygen that receives the electrons, the reaction is as follows 2H + + 1/2 O2 + 2e- -&gt; H2O In the proteins that the electrons pass through to the oxygen, their energy is lost, which is energy that the proteins had at their disposal to send protons H + through the mitochondria, but too many protons can be formed in the mitochondria, which leads to ATP being formed from ADP with the help of mitochondrial membranes and enzymes.

9970,fd9ugb,Placing cells in water. What happens?,"a) An animal cell is placed in distilled water. What happens to the cell and why?

&gt;An explosion occurs as a result of the combination of water in the cell. Equalization of ion, atom/molecule in / and outside the cell concentration will occur as a result of water inflow; the process is called osmosis. There are no ions in distilled water; this leads to an explosion in the animal cell with respect to the inflow of water as there are dissolved ions (aq) and uncharged molecules in a living cell.

b) You put a plant cell in seawater. What happens to the cell and why?

&gt;According to osmosis, the plant cell may die if you place the cell in seawater with a high concentration of salt, then the cell plasma has a greater content of water than its surroundings, which means that water goes out and the cell shrinks and dries.

&gt;The cell membranes delimit themselves from the fluid around them, and have the task of overseeing substances that enter and exit the cell membrane. The cell membranes help to hold cells together in the tissue of the body. Cell membranes consist of lipids and in particular phospholipids, as well as proteins of various kinds. On the glycolipids and proteins, there is something called sugar rings that are carbohydrates, and these are what give an outer layer to the cell membranes, which protect the cell membranes together with water. Cholesterol is also counted as lipids in the cell membranes. The head of the phospholipids dissolves in water and is polar hydrophilic, while the tails are nonpolar fat chains and do not dissolve in water but can dissolve in each other.

9979,fd86db,The different systems of the body that reacts to a wound,"1. You are enjoying a beautiful summer evening and walking barefoot by the beach when you suddenly step on a sharp and rusty nail. Which systems in the body react and how do they react?

**My answer:** The blood vessels contract so as not to allow so much blood to flow through the wound. The blood that flows out solidifies to form a crust to protect the wound, and could consist entirely or partially of coagulated blood, platelets and fibrin threads. The white blood cells also play a part here, being a part of the immune system. Then we have the nervous system that also signals to the brain that you have been injured in the foot, and you need to be careful where you land the foot, through the peripheral nervous system. The hormone system also plays a part by releasing adrenaline, which is a stress hormone whose task is to make the body ready for danger, which in this case applies to me when I step on a sharp and rusty nail. Adrenaline raises the heart rate, blood pressure, and opens up the trachea, which is vital for the individual to be able to provide oxygen-rich blood to the areas that need it in the body.

**What could I add in to identify and explain in detail, correctly and clearly, the systems involved in the reaction? And in terms of terminology, can you spot any flaws? What do I have to do for the discussion to have a well-founded and nuanced arguments presented, and to give a detailed and nuanced account of the consequences of several positions? Also for highlighting relevant new issues that will guide the discussion forward?**",0,2020-03-03 23:15:06,biology

9991,fd5lko,A question about the human physiology — differences in amylase activity for different ethnic groups?,"Three groups of people were examined for how much amylase they had in their saliva. The amylase activity was indicated as units per cm3 of saliva. Below is a description showing the three different peoples, what their diet consists of and their measured amylase activity.

The people of Tswana from South Africa had a diet consisting of carbohydrates derived from sorghum and corn. Sometimes they use small amounts of milk and meat. They only eat fruits and vegetables during the harvest season. The amylase activity was 248/cm\^3.

Then the population of Europeans, fed on a mixed diet was examined, and the amylase activity was 101/cm3.

Bushmen from the Kalahari Desert were mainly fed on birds, lizards, snakes, and insects. They also ate small amounts of roots and other plants. The amylase activity was 22/cm\^3.

How can these differences be explained, are there any hypothesis that supports the explanation, and can one apply a method to get a reason for this?

If we take it a step further and then say that some of these bushmen get a diet consisting of potatoes, flour, beans, and meat, thus, more carbohydrates than they are used to in some, and the amylase activity rises to about 100 units/cm\^3.

What would the previous hypotheses provide in support of this new information that we get?  


#                                    Here's what I think

This is/would be definitive proof that the Amylase activity is linked to diet and not to ethnicity.

&gt;some of these bushmen get a diet consisting of potatoes, flour, beans, and meat, thus, more carbohydrates than they are used to in some, and the amylase activity rises to about 100 units/cm3

It seems pretty obvious (now), that the hypothesis is:

""Given this information, is the difference in amylase activity in these different ethnic groups due to genetic adaptation or due to the specific diet?""

Virtually everything of this is hypothetical, but I don’t think it is much the case because there is apparently a hypothesis that supports these findings, but I am looking to inquire for what the hypothesis that is in support of these findings are, and, why it is the case that the amylase activity is so high. Does genes play a role? The questions are manifold.

I found this in a textbook from the Library, but I remembered inasmuch as to delineate the question at hand. In cases like this, would it be better to rather than discuss it as if it is real data, say that the point is a mental exercise looking at evolutionary vs environmental changes to the human physiology? And the point being to determine whether the amylase levels are something that has evolved due to diet or something that is adaptable based on diet?

In the first case, the levels would not change in a population if the diet was changed in the short term. In the other, a change in levels would be expected, as the body adjusted to the change in diet, because the level would not be set by evolution.

Explanation: The diet modify the amount of amylase produced.

Hypothesis: Eating carbohydrates upregulates amylase production.

Method to validate: Basically what they do after. Give carbs to some of the bushmen. Give less carb to the Tswana. See if amylase expression level changes.

Given the results, you'd say the hypothesis is validated.

One other answer (although it is not elegant) might be that if it was due to ethnicity, you'd expect it to be linked to a DNA sequence change. You might just sequence the appropriate gene, looking for SNP.

a) Yes, and this is because (I guess) it takes longer for the brain to first register visually and then send out nerve impulses to the fingers compared to when the eyes are closed and the body relies solely on the sensory bodies. Can this be compared to reflexes and their function, or is it something else I should think about?

b) I guess this has to do with the nerve impulse, from the fingers reacting to the brain registering what is happening and then activating the muscles in the forearm. Am I wrong?

d) I guess this is because of the nerve threads that go from the finger to the spinal cord and then to the brain and back with a reflex movement, but why is the distance measured only to half the forearm and not fully back to the fingertip?
