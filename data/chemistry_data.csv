2,ifb7hq,Physical/Mechanical interface requirements of liquids in liquid-liquid extractions.,"I read a document online (not a peer reviewed paper) stating that because the solvent being used (water) in a liquid-liquid extraction was polar, inducing increased surface area -via stirring, shaking, etc.- was unnecessary. The reason being that the solvent is polar and therefore “pulls” the solute from the other liquid.

Granted, I’m an amateur chemist and not a working scientist, in any sense of the word, but this just strikes me as incorrect. 

From the research I‘be done and the information I’ve been able to collect, while a polar solvent is attracted at one of its poles to the opposing pole in a solute, it won’t necessarily “pull” all of the solute out of the other liquid. Increasing the surface area seems like a requirement to ensure an effective and efficient extraction....right?",0,2020-08-23 16:01:52,chemistry

4,ifa3fr,Inquiries of a Future Chemical Patent Attorney,"Hey there!

I'm currently a student in college on the path to complete my bachelors in chemistry. I want to become a patent attorney eventually and that requires law school and a STEM degree at minimum. The only problem is that chemical patent attorneys are saturated with PhD burn outs that attend law school in order to change their career. I just had one question to ask you all: 

How many years will it take me to acquire a PhD after I acquire my bachelors degree in chemistry? 

I will probably try to specialize in medicinal/pharma chemistry, or organic chemistry.

https://youtu.be/sPsVdiL-VdM 
https://youtu.be/qB0GDbhpw-Y 
 
69 grams of Gallium, 21 grams of Indium, and 10 grams of Tin are placed in a beaker and heated. The result is 100 grams of galinstan. 
 
90 g of aluminum foil is weighed out and ripped or cut into small pieces. 10 g of Galinstan is weighed out and placed in a crucible. It was heated with a torch. The yield is 100 g of aluminum galinstan amalgam. 
 
A mixture of 17 g (0.3 mole) acetone, 200 ml ethanol, 200 ml 25% ammonia(or 500ml 10% household ammonia), and 80g aluminum galinstan amalgam is placed in a 1 Liter flask(or 2 Liter) and warmed with strong stirring until reaction takes place, after which warming is stopped immediately. Cooling should be applied if the reaction becomes too violent. When the violence of the reaction has diminished, the mixture is refluxed with vigorous stirring for about 3 hrs. The mixture was filtered with a buchner funnel and the galinstan recovered. The filtrate was dried with magnesium sulfate and reacted with hydrochloric acid. The yield is isopropylamine.

But are these ""facts"" true, really?  

Most chemists seem to be aware that both SFAs and UFAs can assume many different shapes, because any two parts of the chain  that are connected by a single bond can rotate about that bond with relatively small energy barriers.  So, in fact, SFAs are somewhat **more**  flexible than UFAs, and  are expected to be **more** crumpled in the liquid or gas state, or in solurions.

However, those two ""facts"" above seem to be widely believed by nutritionists and ""health food"" fans and peddlers.

I am looking for an *authoritative* source that would confirm or refute those ""facts"" -- not by just stating them, but by pointing to experimental determinations of the shapes in liquid/gas/solution forms.  No luck yet.  Could  someone here help, please?

Meanwhile, let me offer, not one, but **two** explanations for the melting point difference, based on the negation of fact (1) -- namely, the counter-claim that ""SFAs are more flexible and normally assume a more crumpled shape than UFAs"":

H1. Since an SFA molecule is more flexible, it can more easily twist or straighten so as to fit into the optimum place in a growing crystal. Hence it starts to crystallize at a higher temperature.

H2. Since an SFA molecule is more flexible, even in the solid state it has more low-energy vibrations modes (that involve simultaneous rotation of two or more single bonds.  When the solid is heated, some of the heat energy supplied goes into these extra vibration modes, rather than pushing the molecules apart.

I don't put much faith in either of these theories, though.  The point is just to show that there are alternatives to the explanation that ""everybody knows"", so its intuitive appeal is not enough.",9,2020-08-22 00:07:27,chemistry

Meaning that even if your d8 distillate tests out clean for d9, it can become hot by converting to d9 once you put it in a vape cart. We heated the distillate to 140C to work with it, as it is very thick and won't move without some heat. We were told that amount of heat is fine. But either way, we have sent out a test sample to our lab AFTER HEATING and are awaiting results. The person telling me this about the possibility of conversion said even the cart can do it, not heat alone, so in that case we really need to test our distillate after it is filled into a vape cart.

He has his mini lab, goggles and every morning starts with what kind of experiment he will have today.  I have run out of ideas with chemicals I have at home, and I was looking for some sort of place that can dispatch small amounts of different reagents for reactions. 

The problem that places I found are dispatching everything in quantities of 250 grams or more. 

I have found shops that sell smaller quantities in the US but they do not ship to us.

120,idr5ih,Poison talk.," Hi guys, first post here. \^\_\^

After watching Breaking bad for the second time i got really obsessed about the ""Ricin"" thing and the chemistry behind BB and found out that it's fairly accurate on some points, something i didn't expect was that when browsing for ""Castor beans"" i would find out that back in mid school i used to play with those by throwing them to my friends, i indeed remembered the seeds (which kinda looked like little beetles for me) since i had cracked the seeds open and peeled off the shiny cover, i also remember EATING some castor beans and in fact being sick for years through mid and high school so it was a bit of a solved mystery for me lol.

Anyway, people in the YT comments from videos about BB chemistry complained about many plotholes or just poorly written passages in the story, one of those being Walt using Ricin instead of any other poison potentially available and as i myself found out, the fact that Ricin doesn't actually work as depicted in the series. Fast forward a couple weeks, i've been watching YT videos from SciShow and similar channels about poisonous plants and i gotta say i'm pretty much living in some forbidden Eden myself since i can find pretty much most top 3 dangerous stuff around my house and have actually been hurt by it during my teen years; one of such videos mentioned a flower called ""Oleander"" which i remember from the game ""Dead Island"" but only knew so much about it, in the SciShow video they mentioned a case of a mortician who was poisoned by a rival with said plant and was pretty much undetected even after the murderer bragged about the method he used to perform the assassination they didn't seem to have found it, got even more interested on toxic plants obviously and today just so happened to find Oleander plants where i least expected, i found them in a small park where i actually worked, had to descend from the bus to take a good look at them an gathered some branches to confirm whether they were or not Oleander and turns out they are, so with all of this stuff just outside my door i wondered how potent are each of them and how different are from one another since Ricin, for example, doesn't survive beyond boiling point temperatures as opposed to Oleander which remains toxic even after burned.

All of this with an utmost scientific goal, believe or not guys, if i wanted to harm anyone i wouldn't need much explanation on the ""how's and why's"" since most stuff kills just by eating it.

What really fascinates me the most is how i've lived so many years around such dangerous plants without noticing, also it kinda inspired me to give chemistry another try since i'm mostly illiterate and didn't really learn much at school let alone remembering it after so many years, last but not least, i'm humbled by how nature can both provide and destroy you depending on where you look, thank you for reading.

I am coming from a non-medical perspective but fear our tests are providing false negatives due to being improperly stored and shipped. We are using the COPAN eSwab UTM SARS-CoV-2 Test Kit (green cap) and self-administering shallow nasal swabs under the supervision of a nurse. We are doing this outside during the day under popup tents in Georgia in August. These kits were being stored in individuals cars between testing days but I did get that practice stopped, thankfully. I mean the kits are shipped in insulated bags for a reason! The tube of UTM says keep between 2 and 25º Celcius (77º Fahrenheit). They are then put in a regular cardboard FedEx box and overnighted to Los Angeles (currently experiencing a triple-digit heatwave). So my question is, what are the potential consequences of exceeding temperature guidelines? The lab uses a Hologic Aptima SARS-Cov-2 Assay (Panther System). 

Would the tests simply come back as invalid?

My question is, if we consider the species PCl3 and PCl5, which is more stable? Secondly, although I understand how the 2 extra bonds can be made, how is it favourable? The Phosphorus atom is gonna break the octet rule and have like 30 trillion extra electrons and so be quite negative. Anyways, whenever I see  P binding 5 times it is always with atoms that are more electronegative (like O and Cl)... so are the extra electrons stabilized by binding to more electronegative atoms which will ""pull"" electrons away, and so decrease the partial negative charge on the P?

166,id72y4,Why source modulation in IR spectroscopy and not UV-Vis?,"In all sorts of applications of IR spectroscopy, the IR source is modulated (flashes on and off) so that the DC absorbance signal turns into an AC signal instead. They can do this either through switching the light on and off with a pulser circuit or using an optical chopper. FTIRs use a vibrating Michelson interferometer, dispersive or single wavelength IR spectrometers use either pulsed sources or a chopper.

I see this done in some laser spectroscopy experiments too, where a laser runs through a chopper before hitting the sample and detector.

I sort of understand the premise: it is hard to measure a small change in absorbance. there is both slow drift and fast noise. Fast noise can be averaged out, but slow drift can't. If you turn the light source into an AC signal then filter out anything that isn't at your designated frequency (lock-in amplification), you can eliminate the possibility of changes in your signal being drift (or something like mains noise).

However, it seems like even spectroscopy techniques that might benefit from this - Raman for instance where signal:noise is essentially 1 in 1 million - don't seem to use pulsed sources. And in regular UV-vis spectroscopy I've never seen an instrument with a flashing source or a chopper wheel.",3,2020-08-20 04:25:22,chemistry

169,id5i7u,Should I even consider studying chemistry again?,"Hello all. When I was in high school, chemistry was my favourite and best subject. I decided to study it in university, and I did well in my first year. However, come second year, I ended up failing and doing very poorly. At that time I was suffering from an undiagnosed mental illness, but I can't tell if that's the reason I failed or if I'm just dumb. I decided to switch degrees and ended up in psychology. So now I have a Bachelor in Psychology but I'm not interested in pursuing pyschology any further. I found out my university does a Graduate Diploma in Chemistry where I'd be able to complete second and third year subjects. Then I'd be able to do a Masters in Chemistry and go from there. This whole endeavor would take me 3 years total... and it is risky. I'm in a better place now than before but I'm not sure if I'd end up struggling again because maybe I'm just not cut out for it? And I'm not sure what the job prospects are for someone who has a graduate diploma and a masters. Would I be employable?

I’m a fire assayer by trade, and I watched some YouTube videos on melting copper in furnaces. They usually start with copper pipe or clean wire, melt it down, at a little borax, and scrape the slag off before pouring. My problem: the slag is incredibly viscous, and doesn’t want to pour or scrape off” at all. Also, the liquid copper tries to freeze almost before it’s clear of the crucible.

I’m blaming this partly on the limitations of my equipment: I’m only using 40-gram crucibles and an electric furnace I really don’t like running above 2,000°F. If I start doing serious pouring, I’m going to invest in larger crucibles and a “Devil Forge” furnace, but I want to nail down the process before spending money. 

My other next steps: I’m going to add Fluorspar to “thin down the mix” and remelt the copper-slag mix like a regular fire assay with soda ash, borax, silica and cream of tartar as the reducing agent.",1,2020-08-19 22:51:59,chemistry

200,icp5rw,Improving the Data Integrity of Spectrometers-FDA perspective.,"  

Data integrity refers to the completeness of data, with nothing missing or inconsistent. In other words, not only the data itself but also the metadata (the results of work that require human intervention, such as specifying conditions and analyzing analysis data) must be presented in a visible form, and verified together with the data. This is achieved by the Report Set.

**Why Data Integrity Is Important?**

The following warning letters have been issued by the FDA, demanding swift response regarding analytical instruments that do not support data integrity.

Warning Letter: 320-17-25 Issue Date: February 24, 2017  
 Investigator observed that your laboratory systems lacked controls to prevent your staff from altering or deleting electronic data. Analysts manipulated and deleted audit trails. You lacked adequate controls for all HPLC, gas chromatography, and ultra-violet systems.

Warning Letter: 320-17-01 lssue Date: October 13, 2016  
 In response, to this letter, provide details of your retrospective review of HPLC and other laboratory data, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, UV spectrophotometry, and (b)(4) analyzer data.

Warning Letter: 320-15-09 lssue Date: April 6, 2015  
 Laboratory  lacked controls to prevent the unauthorized manipulation of your laboratory’s electronic raw data. Specifically, your infrared (IR) spectrometer did not have access controls to prevent deletion or alteration of raw data.

I’m curious about how your curriculum was/is structured; what courses did you take and which of these courses do you cosinder to be the most important (both undergraduate and postgraduate)? 

What mathematical courses are essential for quantum chemistry/computational chemistry?

The curriculum for physical/theoretical chemistry at my university does not include (aside from the introductory undergraduate courses) advanced classical mechanics, electrodynamics, special relativity, advanced quantum mechanics or any math courses. I can't help but to think that omitting these courses is a bad idea, as I am of the impression that in order to become a competent physical/theoretical chemistry you first need a solid understanding of the main topics in physics as well as in mathematics.

I am running a small hydroponics system to grow some herbs and lettuce at STEM camp I am working at and looking for a scalable way to clean large amounts of expanded clay pellets.

Cleaning expanded clay pellets for reuse in hydroponics involves removing organic material, sand formed from pellets clay rubbing together, and then sanitizing.  This is commonly done through a combination of rinsing, boiling, bleach soak, and handpicking roots.  The issue is that its rather tedious as you scale up and I feel like there should be a **way to remove organic material chemically.**

We currently have 50 L of expanded clay pellets and that will need to cleaned sooner rather or later. Additionally, we have:

Citric Acid

Copper Sulfate

Baking Soda

Bleach

Dilute Hydrogen Peroxide

Vinegar

The thing is, is that I have taken basically everything I need in case I do go to graduate school/past the BA requirements (Math, Physics 1, 2 units Gen. Chemistry, Orgo I &amp; II, Inorganic Chemistry, Quantum, Thermo, Biochem, Gen. labs, Orgo labs, 1 Physical Chem lab, graduate bio/chem class). I am currently doing inorganic research and will have 1-1.5 years of that once I graduate.  The only thing I have left to do for a BS is another difficult physical chem. lab, an elective lab, and a notoriously hard physics class + lab. The BA for me would only require any upper writing class and the physics class.

Here is my dilemma- I would essentially have to take all the aforementioned classes left this upcoming semester (not offered in the spring) along with my research (which I would like to focus most of my energy on) which is around 24-25 credits. I am extremely afraid that I will not get the grades I would like, as these labs require an extreme amount of write-ups/lab reports which I am most certainly capable of writing, but do not necessarily have the amount of time to do that, as I have to focus my energy on my other classes/research. Getting Bs wouldn't matter to me, if it weren't for the fact that law schools heavily weigh undergraduate GPA in their admissions, and I did not have the best grades in my early undergraduate career. However, if I do the BA, I know that in addition to spending time on my research, and taking easier classes, I will be able to take several inorganic/other chem grad classes that I am extremely interested in and are feasible.   I know that I would only apply for law school after a few years of work/chem grad school, so I want to make sure that if I finish with a Chem BA, I'll still be able to find a basic laboratory job/apply for grad school with my research background without many difficulties; I don't want to be penalized for not choosing the BS, even if my choice may be ""looked down"" upon. 

Thank you for any and all advice!",4,2020-08-18 11:59:54,chemistry

I'm a TA for inorganic chem for natural scientists at uni. One of the experiments our students carry out is the Silver Mirror. 

My boss said he'd like to let them do a copper mirror too, but he stated hydrazine is just too nasty. I replied that hydrazine sulfate might just work as well. He didn't want to order it right away, so I suggested I'll make a Gram on my own for testing (I'm and organic chemist).

For my question: The ketazine process uses MEK instead of simply acetone as a ketone and I wondered what the reason for that is. 
I don't think we have MEK in the lab (apart from being an additive to ethanol ofc) and if I had to order it, I might just as well order the hydrazine sulfate itself.

We used to actively tutor local high school students, host speakers and little pizza parties afterwards to socialize and network. We would also partake in other activities like little fields trips to local observatories and have events devoted to the chemistry of cooking. 

I’ve been able to work out virtual tutoring with the local high schools.  Working on hosting online speakers too. But I’m having issues thinking outside the box and I’m not sure where to go from here? 

I really want to incorporate other events where we feel more comfortable being goofy college kids instead of being professional 100% of the time. Because it’s a small group, we’re all really good friends with mutual appreciation for the sciences. Our little fields trips and cooking nights where a way for us to forget about finals and studying for a brief second and just enjoy each other’s company and the sciences. I’m hoping to recapture that element, especially with everything going on in our world, I really hope I can create a safe and fun space too.

299,ibmtcy,'Atomic - Periodic Table' - A periodic table app for Android which I developed as a hobby!,"**Hello!**

A couple of weeks ago I released my app 'Atomic - Periodic Table' which has been a passion project of mine as I'm currently studying natural sciences. The app was originally quite small and handcrafted for me, but I've spent the last couple of months expanding it to a state where I believe more people could have a use for it.

# App Overview

https://preview.redd.it/tba59d75lmh51.png?width=1800&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7dc862b864a79dd9d22fb6bfb9555ca67ed9dd64

 ‘Atomic – Periodic Table’ is designed to be intuitive, which means that the app works great for those who only wants basic information like an elements description or atomic weight but also for more advanced users who might want more detailed data like an isotope’s halftime, elements ionization energy and much more. There are multiple tables available including formulas, a dictionary, solubility table and more, as well as some options to easily visualize data. Every month there will be a new update with new features and more data, making the app better for every update. 

# Feature Overview

**·** **Element Details:** Get detailed information of all 118 elements. Everything from the electron number to an elements specific heat or atomic radii.

**·** **Favorite Bar:** Easily put your most used data points front and center in the details page.

**·** **Dynamic Table:** The main table can switch dataset with a simple tap of a button to easily show and visualize important data.

**·** **Electronegativity Table:** View electronegativity in a table where you can easily see the differences.

**·** **Solubility Table:** A solubility table for many compounds.

**·** **Formulas:** To help you with your physics or chemistry calculations. (Currently there is mostly physics formulas available, but that will soon change.)

**·** **Isotope Panel:** Get detailed information about an element’s isotopes.

**·** **pH-Indicator page:** Easily view common pH-indicators and their respective color intervals.

**·** **Electrochemical Series:** Easily find which elements can release electrons more easily than others.

**·** **Dictionary:** Uncertain of what something means? Just look it up in the dictionary.

**·** **Offline Mode:** To save data enable the offline mode which will disable the loading of some images.

**·** **Dark Mode:** For your viewing experience at late night studies.

**·** **And much more, with more to come soon!**

# Current Data and more

As the app just recently launched there might still be some data that may be important to you but that’s currently not available. But worry not, just let me know what data you want available via the issue submission available in the apps settings menu and I will try my best to add it as soon as possible. If you find any errors, please report them and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.

The app is currently only available for Android, but I have started to look into how and when I could start to develop it for iOS.

Get the app now and learn something new!

I wouldn't like to just use some sort of cyanoacrylate without first researching the best bonding agent, so I thought I'd ask the experts here. There are no ID marks anywhere on this part or anywhere else on the device. The casing has an ABS mark, but this is clearly not ABS. It feels rigid to the touch. It came apart at a seam - it was probably glued together in the first place at the factory.

I majored in chem and graduated 2009. However I never used the degree and forgot nearly everything. I really only remember basic biochem and how it relates to nutrition and food. 

BUT

I remember in my first orgo class, some group for their Masters did ionization and element/dissolved solid testing of 20+ brands of bottled water vs municipal supply for everything from fluoride to lead, all that stuff, and Aquafina and Dasani beat everyone by several miles. 

Just curious if anyone has reports that compares all that.

It’s hard finding legit reports because the EPA monitors city water and FDA monitors bottled, so the reports are held to different standards.

It used to be the EPA was way more strict in their reporting. Even if shit was fucked up, you could get the report and see high levels of contaminants in different cities. 

Now, 7-stage RO filtration/distillation etc. for bottled has gotten much more standard.

I am an eighteen-year-old currently temping at a veterinary pharmaceutical company that makes drugs for horses. During my time here I have learned lots of the ""do's and don'ts"" of working in a lab, especially in the IV room where sterility is a huge concern. One thing that has irked me a bit is the danger that solvents pose both in and out of the lab. I was curious as to if I should be concerned about possible health issues due to exposure to said fumes from a combination of work as well as the occasional use of solvents for home projects (floor refinishing, painting, et cetra). I have always been incredibly anxious when it comes to brain damage, so I feel there may be an element of hypochondria in my concern, but after witnessing a dimethylacetamide spill be cleaned up with no PPE I am beginning to become a tad concerned with my own exposure, as I am not incredibly well versed in the various chemicals used at our lab.

If I do glass to glass and they both are dry, it’s usually pretty sealed however I believe I have always been told to use some type of oil as it helps it seal better but I tbink I am against using oil becusse I feel like the stopper has a higher chance of coming off or slightly moving causing a leak becusse of the slipperiness of the oil.

The bottle of (3) Latic Acid from the replacement batch smells like the first original bottle of (1) Salicylic Acid I ordered the other month, and the replacement (3) Glycolic Acid smells like the new batch of (2) Salicylic Acid, and the replacement (3) Salicylic Acid smells like a weak Isopropyl alcohol

So, my question is. What do Salicylic, Lactic and Glycolic Acid Smell like?

425,ia4rse,I want to re-create cel-vinyl animation paint on my own from scratch using chemicals. What niche area of chemistry should I be researching? Details below.,"Ok so. For context.

I'm an animator, and I'm looking for paint that I could apply to animation cels. The problem is, that that kind of paint doesn't exist anymore. The ONLY people who were making it, don't make it anymore, as it has become an antiquated method of cel-painting.

The best way I'd describe cel-vinyl, is that it's fast drying, highly saturated, opaque, sticks to film, and has the feel and heaviness of high flow glue without the stickiness. It is nothing like the acrylic you can get at art stores.

My only hope, is that i'll only have to buy regular acrylic paint or acrylic ink, and mix it with one medium or chemical.

My first instinct was mixing regular high quality acrylic paint with HH-66 vinyl cement, but I don't know if that will work.

I fear that it's not that simple, and that if I wanted to get paint that functioned anything like this, that that'd might mean I'd have to pick up a good old fashion chemistry book and figure out how to make it on my own. I'm not against this and I'm willing to put in the work. The problem I'm having, is that chemistry is a HUGE, BROAD, subject, and what I want to do seems super niche from my perspective. Enough so that I'd be worrying I'd be getting lost or going down rabbit holes, as I am a beginner.

Also, I fear I am already going down a rabbit hole by coming here.

So my Dad has this super old bottle of mercury (I think it was like 10ml, it looked somewhere between 1-2tbs). Since it was heavy I decided to used to it prop up my phone while I took a video of myself (needed an art reference) and of course it fell and shattered.

My mom and I got up as much as we could with syringes and gloves. It got all over our carpet, books, and movies. Once we got up as much as we could we decided to vacuum up the little tiny bits while also covering the vacuum output with a plastic bag and tape. Really stupid idea haha.

Anyways I was wondering how worried I should be? Do I have to throw out all the books it got on even though I wiped them off? Can we even go on that floor let alone that room of the house or will the mercury vapors get into the other rooms that share it’s ac unit?

That class is on level chemistry, I am unsure wether i want to keep that class as is on my schedule or change it for honors chemistry.

I took Pharmacology some AnaPhysio classes and other electives then I got a job in a hospital where we basically do what nurses do except for medication administration and other more rigorous responsibilities/heavier critical thinking. I did not like it; I discovered Nursing was not for me even when I am capable of doing the job well. I did not know that I was rushing myself to get my degree to take care of my family. I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ED, BDD, and social anxiety this year.

I’ve been thinking about getting a degree in History and specialize in Art History as humanities is more of my strength. I SUCK in Chemistry and Mathematics but I want to be in love with it. I love Science and I wanna learn about the littlest of things. I was thinking it may be a good change for me, something new and exciting to learn. I enrolled myself in AS in Science, and AAS in Biotechnology in a community college. Afterwards, I will get a job wit those degrees and pursue a BS in Chemistry - Biochemistry concentration (if I get accepted)

Here are my questions:
1. How stupid are my decisions?
2. If I work hard enough, can I do it? I’m DUMB in Chemistry but I wanna learn it. I’m basically starting from almost a nonexistent knowledge.

The value of u is around 1.66 × 10^27 kg, 
thus, the gram atomic mass should be equal to 3.8 × 10^-26 kg of an atom by calculations, i.e, the mass of an sodium atom is about 3.8 × 10^-26 kg. 
But if we take the molar mass of sodium, i.e 23 g and divide it by Avogadro's number, i.e 6.022 × 10^23, then that would also tell us the mass of an atom of sodium, so if we calculate, the mass of an sodium atom comes out to be 3.8 × 10^-23 kg, which differs by the mass of atom that we calculated earlier. 
Why does these masses differ? 
We just calculated the mass of an sodium atom by two different ways? 
Mass of sodium atom using u : 3.8 × 10^-26 kg
Mass of sodium atom using Avogadro's number : 3.8 × 10^-23 kg

* Heated water in kettle, hot but below boiling, submerged plastic tube containing gallium until fully melted.
* Poured it in my hand, poked around at it. (no contact w/ aluminum).
* Poured it into a small plastic container, let be for a few hours.
* Poured it into large glass bowl filled with cool tap water, added one tray of ice cubes, let sit submerged overnight. 
* Still liquid in the morning. Removed from bowl, poured back into original tube,

I’m a recent chem grad who just landed a job as a QC lab tech at a cosmetics manufacturer. I was pretty excited to work but now that I’ve just started, I’m disappointed. I’ve had talks with multiple coworkers in my first 2 weeks and have heard some concerning things. 

The main issue is that it looks like they don’t allow people in my position, to learn the fundamental instrumentation for the analytical field, like HPLC. They have openings, they’re short staffed. Yet, I’ve heard from multiple quitting employees that they didn’t get that opportunity to learn despite requesting it (all have worked over a year). My secondary trainer has told me that I should ask to be trained after 3 or 4 months of work, however, I’m not sure if that’s a realistic option, considering the fact that I’ve overheard my supervisors say they’d rather outsource for it during one of my breaks. Additionally I don’t think any of the work I’m doing would really help in the future (all I do is check Specific gravity, pH, viscosity, on top of documentation).

Considering how important these techniques are in the field I wanted to get experience with it, or at least the opportunity to learn for future career options. 

I’ve been getting calls from other recruiters about opportunities to work with HPLC, GC-MS, NMR more closer to my home. So I guess the whole point of this post is: 

1) For contract work, do you have to stay for the entire duration? 
2) If I can leave, Is it wise to simply stay and build up a resume ?",0,2020-08-13 18:57:48,chemistry

544,i8vcpu,A word to amateur chemists.,"I've been doing amateur chemistry for ages. I recently got into organic chemistry. I stored my chemicals well, not perfect, but well. I planned out every single experiment for days and always worked outside. I wore all of the appropriate PPE and did everything right. 

Why am I writing? Well, I absolutely hate to say it and I know I will be yelled at for this but it needs to be put out there as a solid warning. Learn from me and not your own mistakes. I love chemistry, it's my passion. That's why it's so damn hard to quit for me. But I think I've hit that point now. Maybe I just have to spend ages trying to find 100% safe chemistry and live with the boring reactions and no multi-step synthesis. 

I used to be into explosive chemistry but I had done everything I could think of with it. I was semi safe and no one ever got hurt. I was always stressed about having explosives pop up at the airport and me not being able to fly to visit my family or getting in huge trouble. So I finally gave up on that. I moved on to organic chemistry instead for which I have a huge love for. I decided on making benzocaine from toluene that I got from a carb cleaner bottle.

The most toxic substance I'd have to work with was mononitrotoluene. Toxic and carcinogenic. I did everything right to keep me safe, worked outside full PPE, etc. I made a single mistake that I thought was negligible after having made and handled this stuff for a few days. I turned off the fan that was supposed to right away disperse vapors.I was outside, it was safe, right?

Well, one of my family members was on the balcony (about 30 feet away which I thought was adequate) and was exposed to it. They smelled something weird and reported a sweet taste in their mouth and slight burning sensation. I was exposed to negligible levels as well but never had a sweet taste in my mouth from it or a burning feeling meaning they were exposed to a decent amount. So, this was the second time in years that I exposed someone I loved to chemicals. I am done. I quit and if you don't have proper ventilation you should too. Or work with really safe stuff which is often boring and very very limiting. Since the isomer separation went terribly and I recovered less than 500mg of the target isomer (out of an expected 15-20 grams), it was all for nothing anyway. I lacked some equipment which was my downfall in the end. 

I thought about just buying the p-nitrobenzoic acid so I don't have to work with nasty chemical again but realized that the reduction I wanted to do used HCl. Even if done outside and if I neutralized vapors through a trap, I could still have something go wrong like something as stupid as turning off the fan despite being outside. 

I spent days planning for explosions, runaways, ventilation, PPE, storage, making sure I have the chemicals and equipment (I thought I could get away with gravity filtration like others but since I didn't have a lab freezer and there was no way in hell I'd put it in the food freezer I didn't have a choice. I had a vacuum filtration set up but I didn't want to destroy my pump since the nitrotoluene was semi corrosive to plastics and maybe metals), etc. yet despite days of planning and thinking that all was well, it still went wrong. Last time I exposed someone to something a bit worse was when I left the distillation on its own and just watched through a window. The greasing fluid (fluid was required for this) evaporated and leaked the vapors. I was inside and didn't know. I hate myself for that until this day even though besides some coughing they were just fine. It's still not right and could've ended wayyyy worse. 

I changed everything on how I do things and thought I was super safe. I was far from it. Home chemistry just can't be done safely unless you have a proper fumehood and are a lot further away from people. 

As much as I love this hobby (this seriously feels like my purpose in life) I have to give it up. I was always able to keep myself safe but not others around me. It just can't be done unless you use non volatile and safe chemicals. Stick to crystal growing I guess. 

I'd also like to add that I am absolutely ashamed of what happened and it punches a hole in my heart everytime I think of it. While the person was just fine and the exposure was honestly nothing to really worry about (had they been outside longer, it'd probably be different), I still exposed them to nasty chemicals. Not to mention the neighbors too! I put their life at risk. This can happen with seemingly normal chemicals like acids as well. Solvents, gases, acids, some bases, etc. it's just too uncontrollable and basically all of the chemistry I like doing can't be done without them. 

So I know I will be torn apart in this sub reddit but instead of just hiding this like most do, I feel like people just need to know and learn from my foolishness. If I can prevent someone else from having this happen, that makes it all worth the bashing and such.

I feel like there is some safer chemistry I may do just to not have to give up on chemistry but after seeing how even the most common chemicals can also cause similar if not worse effects, I may just give up. I'd like to make biodiesel with methanol being the worst thing but I'm still hesitant. Benzocaine from PABA is a maybe. but too simple for my taste. I really wanted to be able to just do a multi step synthesis for once but look at what happened. Just doing the esterification seems too boring and simple. But the simple and almost 100% safe chemistry is what it seems must be limited to at home. I had reactions that challenged me and used the awesome advanced equipment I had acquired over the years but most of those reactions just can't be done anymore. 

 I'd love to make chloroform and distill it but what about the vapors? Toxic and carcinogenic. Not something that should be released at all. See, lots of projects (chlorobutanol, thymolphthalein, just using it as a solvent in general) are all out of the window already. No volatile acids, nitric acid , HCl, gone. Super useful but vapors can't be controlled properly even outside as indicated by previous accidents and this one. It really limits what you can do. 

So yes, I know what I did was horrible and I hate myself for it. I really do. Amateur chemistry keeps me going and it is truly a passion. I feel like the ""love"" blinded me from the danger. So while I hope you guys won't be too harsh on me, I just hope this makes other amateurs rethink the projects they have planned.

We publish creative non-fiction and fiction about science, scientists, and the interaction of science and society. You can find us on Instagram &amp; Twitter @tamarindlitmag and our [editor's bios are here](https://tamarindlit.co.uk/?page=about).

Pieces should be between 1,500 to 5,000 words long and we accept simultaneous and multiple submissions. We don’t require first or exclusive rights to your work (though naturally if it is unpublished we will end up with first rights). We're sadly not accepting poetry because none of us feel qualified to judge it.

**Non-fiction**: we accept submissions for essays and opinion pieces about the interaction of science with society and histories and biographies of science and scientists.

**Fiction**: we'd like stories that have realistic portrayals of science, scientists, and their impact on society. This includes things like [lab lit](http://www.lablit.com/) and sci-fi with a more literary bend to it. As another example, take a look at *[(Nothing but) Art](http://sciencechallenge.org/2019-winners/leroi-ic-1.pdf)* written by our fiction editor.

[For full information, including how to submit and our privacy policy, see our website here](https://tamarindlit.co.uk/?page=submissions).

I’m really interested in drug innovation and drug delivery systems and I think I want a career in industry, but I’ve never actually worked in industry. What are pros and cons to one or the other? I think, from my google searches, people with degrees in pharmaceutical sciences have a greater starting salary, but are more limited in their job search. Would I have a harder time finding a job in academia with a degree in pharmaceutical sciences? Would industry be my only option? Any advice would be great! Currently plan to apply to ~10 schools and half are pharma science programs and the other half chem bio. Thanks in advance!!",2,2020-08-12 14:56:06,chemistry

I am currently a chemist at a refinery making very good money working many hours. The company I am with offers tuition reimbursement so I am planning on pursuing a masters. I like the company and I would be happy to move up and stay with them until I retire however the oil industry is currently on a constant decline which makes me worried. If I wanted to move up in the company I would need an MBA but if the industry tanks in 20 years I would need to be able to find another job in a different field. There are other masters programs that chem bachelor holders can pursue like supply chain and accounting but I don't know which one to choose. On the other end I could pursue either materials science, polymer, or organic chemistry as a master but I am not sure that a masters in the chemistry field can yield 6 figure salaries since as most know the chemistry field is mostly low paying.

To interpret the graph in a meaningful fashion, all  that is needed is that the graph needs to be spun 90 degrees clockwise  and then compared to the Wolynski-Taylor Diagram. The sizes/masses of  the objects are not representative, only the ages/ratios of D/H are  compared. In essence, as the objects age and evolve/disintegrate, the  D/H ratio of the material rises. This means the most pristine D/H ratio  that is representative of any star or stellar remains is contained in  the youngest of stars, to the very left hand side of the diagram.""

I know the guidelines say that diluted bleach must be mixed fresh every 24 hours, but I also see that I can buy cleaning solutions with bleach that have a shelf life of months.

If I dilute household bleach (5 to 6%) by a factor of 10 and store it in the dark in a mostly opaque spray bottle (it has a small ""window"" to see the fill level) at 78-F and only take it out to use for a few minutes every few days, what will the concentration be down to after a week? After a month?

For typical household disinfection, I see recommendations like 30 to 1 or 50 to 1 dilution of household bleach, so if I start at 10 to 1, it should take a while to get down to 50 to 1, right?

Or does it really decay to 50 to 1 in just 24-hours?

I know very little about chemistry, despite always being a science nerd, and would like to learn this empirically for the most part... despite asking questions where necessary, like this one!

Since I need to use a solvent for this extraction, namely alcohol, what is the lowest percentage of alcohol that would be appropriate for this process? It's just a regular 2L short path distillation system, which I've also been purifying some alcohol with to attempt to make my own solvent since, well, the world is sort of short on alcohol right now.

Highest I've gotten on my system was I think 93-94% abv? It has come to my attention that my limit will be 95.57(?) that I can distill at a maximum. Right now, I have a bottle that is around 92% that I plan on redistilling if necessary.
What would be the potential consequences of using an alcohol that was too low in ABV?

Bioabsorbable lactide/glycolide polymer excipients have helped, for over several decades, to facilitate the safety, efficacy and performance of complex parenteral drug products designed for extended release. Such functional polymeric excipients enable systemic or local delivery of peptides and small molecules for days, weeks and months. Preparations include microparticles, nanoparticles, implants, in situ forming implants and devices. More than 50 drug products utilizing these excipients are now on the market worldwide and further growth is anticipated. For formulation success, it is important to recognize and understand the key properties of tunable lactide/glycolide polymer excipients and how they interact with drug properties. This presentation will highlight key properties of lactide/glycolide excipients for drug delivery and demonstrate how to apply these excipient properties to achieve desired formulation performance while optimizing processes for the clinical and commercial manufacturing of the sterile drug product. Microencapsulation processes will be highlighted to show the importance of scale up considerations and use of advance processes such as continuous manufacturing. In summary, this presentation will show how the properties of lactide/glycolide excipients and drug substance along with product-by-process manufacturing define formulation matrix structure. This matrix structure that then defines drug delivery performance.

About one year ago, last summer, I spilled an entire 25L Jerry can of gasoline in my trunk. 94 octane.

I cleaned it as well as I could using bleach and baking soda, but I made the mistake of not removing my trunk floor mat, taking out the donut tire, and doing the wheel well.

That wheel well is now heavily coated in thick, black oil and my car still to this day smells like gasoline. Anything I put in my trunk for more than an hour smells like gas for weeks.

This has been dry for a year. It’s a black oil substance - but a line of it. Like an inch thick in the entire under area of my trunk. Is it safe to use bleach to scrub this shit out or will that cause it to explode or some shit?

I’ve done inorganic research and I love it, it’s not really hypothesis driven but more of just discovery in creating different coordination complexes and using X-Ray crystallography to determine the lattice structure.

I did it all outside and all of those are not extremely toxic or corrosive. They are irritants but holy hell they are good irritants. It's been 5 days since and I have gotten a lot better but there is still a feeling. It went from some irritation on the first two days, to some dryness ( I tried some steam inhalation to help out and have been drinking lots of water) on the third and fourth day, and today it feels like I may have some muscle ache if that makes sense, in that spot. Maybe I was subconsciously always moving the muscle around? I can't tell if it is actually irritation/inflammation or if it is just soreness.  

What the fuck did the SuperTech carburetor cleaner really contain? I doubt that toluene, acetone, or methanol which are irritating, would produce such lasting effects. What was really in there? It was some strong stuff or something. I have handled acetone and methanol separately many times before with no issues. Maybe it's the toluene? I have used some toluene before but my god that stuff must be strong or something.

To make them ready for sale (to be used as dish gardens)  we caulk any seams,  allow 48 hours to cure,  then spray Flex seal interior. 

Today,  upon application,  Flex seal burst into flame.  And I mean it ignited the Flex seal that had been applied AND the stuff coming out of the can still. Flames had engulfed work area in microseconds,  approx 3'x4' and were licking the low ceiling. 

Fire extinguisher saved the day. No FD was called, only very minor (hair) injuries,  all eyebrows intact.

I am a smart person, but did not attend college.  I have a passion for chemistry applications,  so I understand how the silicone/latex caulk and/or the flex seal may use an exothermic activator of sorts to expedite the curing process.  

However I (admittedly after the fact) checked both containers for warnings, they didn't explicitly warn against mixing anything, {they did mention vinyl may be problematic...} so us small brains think since she was standing on carpet,  working with aerosol sprays and metal,  on a plastic cart, that static electricity spark may be the culprit.

So recently I learned more about how stuff burn, and turns out from what I learn and understand a lot of stuff burn first requiring a pyrolysis to happened before the “gas” burn. Is this correct? If so how does charcoal burn? From what I know charcoal are wood that already goes through pyrolysis.

I know how stuff oxidize when they burn, I know basic about fire, what confuse me is how do stuff burn? Is it first they go through pyrolysis or they just able to burn even in solid or liquid form?

1106,i2oahv,Switching from organic to computational during PhD - so many worries,"Hey everyone,

Struggling in deciding my path forward. I appreciate anyone that takes the time to read and give their input. Thank you! 

I have been struggling since starting my PhD program. I have completed a MS in organic synthesis at a much smaller university and had hopes to go into flow chemistry. Now working in a sort of big name lab at a top 60 university (based on USnews rankings) for chemistry doing a project that involves a little bit of flow with one year completed. Sadly, I feel like my motivation for doing lab work is totally gone. Im still working still but just don't enjoy it. I look at running reactions, columns, and nmr as something I just have to do before I can go home. I don't even really enjoy the flow aspect of my project, I mean I am just doing the same thing but pumping reagents through tubing instead of using rbfs. I am worried that won't enjoy doing synthesis or working on flow chemistry outside of academia as well.  I still enjoy reading and writing about my project just dread the lab work. I also feel very inept - I'm kind of clumsy in the lab, I suck at doing synthesis on paper, and really suck at remembering reactions. Worried that this will significantly hinder my ability to be an great chemist and that I will result in an unenthusiastic LOR from my PI. I do have a 1st author JOC publication from my MS and will likely publish something similar by the end of the year from this lab.

Over quarantine, I have been playing with python and have been having a lot of fun with it. Due to all of the above and the fun I have been having programming, I have been thinking of moving to a computational group in the biophysics field - pretty heavy programming lab. I have been looking into jobs for computational PhD's and they seem quite interesting, CADD and automated synthesis. This is a big big decision and I really need some input from others.

Here are some questions:

How different is synthetic work in industry from academia (flow or process chemistry would be more up my alley)? 

What does the job outlook look like for someone coming from a pretty well respected lab? I have heard a lot about organic synthesis being a saturated field and worry that I won’t be competitive enough to get real good job. How saturated would you say the computational field is? 

I see that a lot of computational chemistry jobs are mostly in Boston - do either of these fields somewhat lock me into a certain location?

If there are any computational chemist or synthetic chemist that would be willing to talk about some more specific things I would be really grateful. I need someone to bounce ideas and questions off of as I worry that I may be somewhat misguided and am too worried to talk to anyone in my lab about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to address anything that I have written about and ask about anything that I have left out.

This is what the comment said with what I'm confused about followed:

Based on what I read, there are different types of plasma. But ""foam, colloid, and gel"" are not among them. However, gel and foam (along with sol) are indeed types of colloid. I don't get why this person says colloids are a subset or type of plasma.

I still like to think (perhaps due to my youth and naïveté) that my scientific work might be able to leave the world just a little bit better than the way that I found it. That aspect of my work really inspires me, knowing that one day this research could actually help provide clean water to someone who needs it.

On the other hand, the science and engineering of water filtration isn’t immediately exciting to me. When it comes to fundamental science and the love of knowledge for knowledge’s sake, I think that my interests lie in Astrochemistry. I always wanted to be an astronaut when I was little, only for my dreams to be shattered when I discovered that I would need 20/20 vision to be one (and my vision is so, so bad). After sulking for a while, I stumbled upon the beauty of Chemistry and fell in love with that discipline as well. The only thing is, Astronomy/Astrochemistry will always be my first love. While I find the subject itself invigorating, I’m worried that I would feel like I was being selfish with my scientific abilities by marveling at the universe above me instead of working to improve the lives of those around me. As a result, I’m also highly considering a Materials Science track where I can put my skills to work and try to create things that would directly help people every day.

I’m exceptionally lucky to be going to a great school where I’ll be able to study Molecular Engineering and Astrophysics and graduate with a degree in both. My only issue is when I inevitably attend graduate school, I won’t be able to pursue both of those interests equally like my undergraduate experience. Has anyone here been in a similar predicament?

1131,i2di0q,Can carbonates decompose,I was working on making a solution of sodium dicarbonatocuprate from sodium carbonate and copper hydroxy carbonate. Once I had mixed the two the color began to change but got darker and darker till it became a deep black. I filtered the solution assuming it was just a few suspended particles of trash but it turns out it was actually organic carbon garbage. My copper carbonate is made from copper sulfate washed in concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium bicarbonate from a pure source (bag of 99.99% arm and hammer baking soda) which the sodium carbonate was also made from using heat catalyzed decomposition. No idea where all the garbage came from since the were absolutely no organics involved. Is it possible for carbonate to somehow reduce themselves all the way to carbon?

I'm a Respiratory Therapy student, and we're going over some refreshers right now in terms of chemistry and physics. One thing that bothers me is they describe in my textbook that solids retain their shape due to **strong** mutual forces called van der Waals forces. I don't know if I'm understanding this incorrectly, but I remember back from college times that van der Waals were the weakest of all forces, and they're really just existing pretty much everywhere, including in gases. I remember primarily covalent and ionic bonds being responsible for keeping the shape. Is there an exception to this rule? I know there are different types of van der Waals forces, but is this what truly helps solids maintain their shape?

I have planned it out anyway using what I know and predicting the outcome but it'd be nice to see if there is any documented literature that I could double check my work with before starting the synthesis. 

The reduction of p-nitrobenzoic acid using Sn/HCl is rare to find documenter but I was able to put together a synthesis using similar reactions. I also was able to find a single paper that documented their synthesis and what I had planned matched their synthesis.

1265,i0tda2,Carbon vs Carbon Dioxide,"Hello everyone! 

I'm a linguist trying to make heads or tails out of the difference between C and CO2 in environmental talks.   
I've been trying to understand whether people really use those terms interchangeably and if it creates confusion for the reader who's not a specialist in chemistry. Well, it does create a huge confusion for me!

I guess we all agree that carbon and carbon dioxide are completely different things, but when you read some articles and see **sequestering carbon** and **sequestering carbon dioxide** in the same paragraph, you start asking yourself questions...

My main question is.. is it really okay for a scientists to say **carbon emissions** and **carbon dioxide emissions** in the same context meaning the same thing because everybody from the academic world would understand what the author means? 

It is true that we can say something like ""*the average adult human produces about 1kg of* ***CO2*** *per day. In other words, a person releases about 290g of* ***carbon*** *each day.*"" The metrics is different so it's obvious that we're talking about different things in this case. 

But... when I see these 2 sentences in the same article I'm really confused: 1) ""*Boreal forests are especially vulnerable to climate change, and the decline of these systems leads to dramatic* ***carbon emissions.***"" 2) ""*The burning of carbon-based fuels employing current technology* ***releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.***"" 

Is the author talking about the same process happening? In the 1st sentence, is he talking about carbon dioxide emissions just being lazy and skipping the word 'dioxide' or is he talking about the carbon emissions which do not have anything to do with carbon dioxide? 

Another question regarding the following sentence: ""*If the use of carbon-based fuels continues to grow at a yearly rate of 4,3% then 14,4 Gtons of* ***carbon*** *would be released as* ***carbon dioxide*** *in the year 2000.*""  
In what other forms can carbon be released from the use of carbon-based fuels?

From the viewpoint of a linguist, it's a total mess.  
Could you make it clearer?

I have a quick question for some research I'm doing on placement.   
Am I doing something wrong, or there is nothing on the internet on ""Reduction potentials of elements at high temperatures?"". Is the assumption that they all increase in reductive/oxidizing power equally/linearly with increasing temperature?

  
I have been running a series of Al melts and then analyzing the chemical composition of the samples made. I am now trying to explain the different increases and decreases in element% ,within the different samples, in terms of oxidation and reduction of metals and oxides within the melting pot.  
Therefore trying to say something on line of ""The Fe (metallic) % increases as the Al will reduce it's oxide."" Thus, I was wondering how the reduction potentials of elements vary as you reach higher temperatures (as in (very randomly), would Ca perhaps surpass Al in oxidation potential after 800\*C).  


All the tables stated are ""standard reduction potentials"" carried out at 25\*C. I can't seem to find anything besides those.

BUT WHAT IS THE REFERENCE POINT? 50kj from WHAT?

Is it energy required to bring the reactants from absolute zero (IE, zero kinetic energy) to the transition state? comparable? standard enthalpy of formation, energy required to bring it up from atoms in elemental state

Is it from standard conditions? 25C?

And if it is from absolute zero, then the understanding activation energy diagrams change a lot. It means the ground-state products and reactants both have ""zero"" kinetic energy or close it, or in other words, they're at absolute zero, with only potential energy stored in the chemical-energy bonds.

So what that means is the kinetic energy is added to the system via heating from the surroundings, until the particles possess enough kinetic energy to reach transition state, and after that, all unused energy is ""dissapated"" and the particles return to absolute zero (zero kinetic energy) but with enthalpy changes, changes to the potential energy of the system.

1332,i07m1i,Error with IKA Elektrasyn 2.0 - Vial Not Connected or Resistance too High,"Hi I am working on trying to electrolyse a solution of 2-bromo-2-methylpropanoate. Basically this compound has a C-Br bond which can be reduced, that is, the bond can be cleaved by electrochemical reduction. This cleaving of the bond should generate isobutyrate carbon radicals and a bromide ion. The process of reduction is irreversible since the carbon radicals formed should couple together to form a dimer of the isobutyrate molecule rather than returning to the electrode to be oxidised - the butyrate is reduced but never re oxidised.

Any who, I am trying to do this reaction by applying a constant potential to reduce the molecule and generate the dimer. I am using the IKA elektrasyn 2.0, with a Pt counter electrode, slim glassy carbon electrode (diameter is about a millimeter), and Ah/AgCl reference electrode. I use 1 mM of the isobutyrate with 100 mM of KCl background electrolyte.

When I run a constant potential on the IKA, I get the error in the title. It is impossible that the vial is not connected as it is possible to do CV measurements on it so the vial must be connected. That points to the resistance being too high.

There is more than enough background electrolyte: a 100x excess of electrolyte compared to 1mM analyte so the error makes no sense.

The most likely cause of the issue might be that the carbon working electrode is too small, meaning the surface area is too high and thus the reaction cannot progress. I may try to use the other, bigger carbon electrode.

Any tips?",5,2020-07-29 15:04:37,chemistry

I am a passionate lover of tea, and enjoy reading and learning about effects of different chemicals on human body, mind, etc.  And I was wondering what is the best way to extract the most L-Theanine from Camelllia sinensis, more specifically green tea. I was reading that Polyphenols and such can be extracted by Microwave assisted extraction, and with water extraction. 

Now as I am just a regular person, I have no fancy devices in my home, so I want to know what is the best way to extract those things by myself. I have also read in some research that they found most L-theanine can be extracted by soaking tea in 80°C for 30 minutes, where tea is from 0 mm to 5 mm big. (Although on other places I read that L-theanine melting point is around 217°C)

So I am wondering would I get the most polyphenols and L-theanine(and other healthy chemicals) By doing the method above and putting my tea in the microwave afterwards for few minutes?

P.S. How correct is my information, and feel free to correct me and teach me stuff lol.

1367,hztrva,Can you think of a better way to explain some very basic chemistry to a non science minded person?,"So I've been making cold process soap for years and have recently started selling. I have a grasp on he process enough that I can explain it to other's at a very basic level. Lye is added to some kind of liquid (usually water) to make a solution that you then add to fat. The lye and the fat react and create soap. You add more oil than the lye can react with, so at the end you're left with a bar that's soap, water and a small (3-10% usually) amount of purposefully leftover oil. 

So things are going well with selling soap, except for a few people in my life that are...misinformed. Specifically, I have an aunt who is very displeased that I ""choose to use lye, a caustic , unnatural chemical"" in my soap. I've tried explaining the process to her, and the general fact that without lye there is no soap. She however doesn't believe me, saying ""It's like a cake recipe, you can't see the eggs but they're still in there and a person who's allergic to eggs couldn't eat it."".  This is made worse by the fact that she gets her soap from a farmers market and a seller who says their soap is ""Lye free"". 

I've tried explaining that the cake comparison isn't really an accurate comparison, but I lack the full scope of understanding to fully back that up I guess. A cake undergoes a bunch of chemical reactions and some new compounds are created (like gluten?) but in the end it hasn't fully synthesized into something completely new.  To help illustrate this I've explained that Sodium is an explosive metal and Chlorine is a deadly gas, but the two together as a compound become salt, and lack the properties of elements that make them up.

Normally I wouldn't care and would just move on, but this is a person I have to see at gatherings and the are actively badmouthing my soap in a way that's completely unfair/untrue.",13,2020-07-28 23:02:25,chemistry

7. Leave in 1 mM methylene blue solution for 24h

Data showed that methylene blue was present in fairly quantities on the surface of gold, given a very faint signal.

Method 2:

1. Sonicate chip in acetone for 5 mins
2. Sonicate chip in DI water for 5 mins
3. Rinse in EtOH
4. Dry in N2

6. Let the chip sit in piranha solution for 15 minutes

9. Leave in 1 Mm methylene blue solution for 24h

Data showed that methylene blue was present in very high quantities on the surface of gold, with a signal 10 times higher than that of the first process.

What gives? Is it because the H2 and the piranha might be altering the oxidation states of the gold at the surface? Could piranha be thiolating the surface of gold?

Currently, my undergraduate research is focused on the characterization of non-volatile PFAS in firefighter turnout gear. I am with a great PI who pushes me into more projects and is actively engaged in all of the grad students' work and day to day life (which I do enjoy). Also, I am the only undergraduate (actively) working with this group. Currently, I have an offer with this PI to pursue a Ph.D. either with the Department of Chemistry or Environmental and Molecular Toxicology. I am very interested in validating methods for large volume injection of organic micropollutants (specifically, PFAS) and working with collaborators to report levels of PFAS in various matrices (biota, textiles, groundwater, and soils). 

I have seen a lot of people take a year or two in industry before pursuing their Ph.D. and am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience (BS straight to MS/Ph.D.). For those who have done either, I would just like to hear your side of the story.

Forgive me if this is the wrong sub, but I have a serious problem, and I don't know where to look.

**Backstory**

* My family and I live on a farm. My dad uses sulphur to spray the plants / trees.
* One of those plants is a 100 year old grapvine that growns directly on the side of the house.

**The problem**

* Everytime my dad sprays the plants, the house becomes contaminated by sulphur smell.
* The smell lingers in the house for days. 
* It is burning my eyes and making it water. My mother also has the same problem.

**What we tried**

* We tried ventilating the house, but many of the windows are old and don't open. 
* The ones which do open are behind the grapevine, so they only bring more sulphur into the house.

We spoke to my dad, but the sulphur does not affect him, so he does not believe it is a problem and is refusing to do anything about the problem.

So I would like to know if there is any way, perhaps with common house chemicals that I can use to clean the air of sulphur. It's in the bedrooms now and won't got out and our eyes are burning.

1414,hzfo6m,What chemicals can be used to degrade C17H21NO4 beyond the recognition of a spectrometer?,"  Now, allow me to elaborate before any eyebrows are raised. I work in an industry that frequently remediates theft-recovered vehicles, drug labs, and other crime scenes to make them suitable for human habitation again. We use spectrometry to identify narcotics and the quantity that they exist within the environment. During the decontamination process we use a battery of chemicals which works wonderfully to destroy any trace of narcotic. However, the aforementioned chemical is notoriously difficult to entirely eliminate and we often find trace amounts in our post-test results. As a result we must decontaminate the area a second time to ensure our results come up completely negative.

  What chemical or combination of chemicals would best be used to remove any trace of the substance? Ideally, it should be non-toxic and leave upholstery unharmed. However, at this point I'm just curious either way.

From my point of view, there should not. Maybe the color of iron sulfate is a little off in comparison and maybe the equilibrium is a little off (so maybe its slower).

1466,hyxyrr,Diluting hydrogen peroxide with a phosphate buffer (Why does this MIT study do this when preparing solutions?),"Hi everyone, I'm currently in 12th grade, and for my IB Chemistry IA (a science project), I'm trying to **determine the activation energy of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by catalase**. 

Since this is a pretty common experiment, I have the procedure/method down pretty much. But there's one thing I don't get, and it's about **using a buffer solution to maintain the pH**. Specifically regarding [this MIT experiment guide](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-310-laboratory-chemistry-fall-2017/labs/MIT5_310F17_Catalase_Lab.pdf) (page 10, ""Preparation of Stock Solutions""). 

If you're too lazy to scroll through it, [here are the screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/cF6S0sP). 

My questions are:

1. Why is it necessary for the ""working buffer solution"" to **""contain the *same concentration of phosphate* as the stock H2O2 solution""**?
2. Why do you have to prepare **both** the ""stock H2O2 solution"" AND the ""working buffer solution"" when A) the buffer was already added to the original H2O2 solution to make the ""stock H2O2 solution"", and B) the two different solutions will be mixed together in the experiment anyway (view my highlighted 2nd Imgur screenshot or go to page 17 in the doc)?

Basically, I'm asking if it's okay for me to *skip* Step 4: ""Preparing a working solution of phosphate buffer"", and **simply do Step 3: use the phosphate buffer to dilute the H2O2 solution to 4%. Would this suffice to maintain the pH of the reaction in presence of catalase?

I am doing an XPS analysis of some nanoparticles and I have read that in order to understand the analysis it is necessary to understand all the chemistry around an atom, which is what I am doing. In my xps analysis I have found regions directly represent the  Ti 2p , Ti2 p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 levels. I would like to know how these regions are identified as such with XPS and how they are related to the oxidation states of my material (which is Titanium), to understand the subject better I started to make the electronic configuration of the titanium but I cannot understand how these regions come out if the configuration of the titanium is: 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d2.

Basically, what are those fractions that are at the right side of the levels (1/2, 3/2, etc.) and how does the XPS identification of regions correlate with the oxidation states of the material?[XPS](https://ibb.co/42czstJ)",2,2020-07-26 13:00:45,chemistry

1627,hx1fx9,Do hydrophobic molecules lower the entropy or raise the enthalpy of water?,"Let's say we put liquid hexane in water. I know it will not dissolve because it is thermodynamically unfavourable. But I'm hoping someone could clarify why.

I used to think hexane solvation (in water) breaks and thus lowers the total number of hydrogen bonds allowed in water, but maybe hexane solvation lowers the total number of arrangements of the water molecules adjacent to it? So the solvation of hexane would lower the water's entropy, which is unfavourable, so it doesn't happen.

Or does hexane solvation simply break hydrogen bonds and make the water's enthalpy more positive? Or maybe it's both?

I was told that the hydrophobic collapse of polypeptides maximises water's entropy, but maybe things are different when dissolving hydrophobic molecules.",8,2020-07-24 08:06:06,chemistry

The RSC has just launched an initiative though their [diversity and inclusion fund](https://www.rsc.org/awards-funding/funding/inclusion-diversity-fund/#specificcall) looking for ""community-driven projects that look at the needs, challenges and opportunities in support of the Black chemistry community"".

&amp;#x200B;

# Press Release:

&gt;**Listening to the Black chemistry community**  
&gt;  
&gt;The recent surge of action in the #BlackLivesMatter movement has spurred us to do more, quicker, for the Black chemistry community, and to listen to and learn from Black chemists. We are fast-tracking research to understand Black chemists’ experience of racism and discrimination, the depth and breadth of it, and what we specifically need to do to help eradicate it.In the meantime, we are making funding specifically available right now for community-driven projects that also support the Black chemistry community.
&gt;
&gt;**Apply for funding now**
&gt;
&gt;Do you have an idea for a project that looks at the needs, challenges and opportunities in support of the Black chemistry community?  
&gt;  
&gt;We have created a specific call to support these projects through our Inclusion &amp; Diversity Fund. We will consider individual applications up to the value of £5,000. Funding greater than £5,000 may be considered for large-scale projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;[**Submit your application**](https://www.smartsurvey.co.uk/s/IDFundBlackChemistryCommunity/)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Applications open on 23 July 2020** and we will respond to you within 3 weeks of receiving your completed application.  
&gt;  
&gt;We know these are small initial steps, but we are committed to driving long-term change. We will gain valuable insights from these projects run by dedicated members of the chemical sciences community, and we will share the insights from the projects so that everyone can access them.

The reactions I perform don't use open flames but sometimes involve flammable solvents. Often I use corrosive things like acids and bases and I typically don't work with very toxic things. Usually only mildly toxic chemicals but sometimes I do have to work with very toxic chemicals. This guide I found from the Ohio Polytechnic University (link below) claims that it would be appropriate to use this lab coat for my reactions. I am able to easily take off the lab coat in the event of an accident but I am mainly worried about either a hot solvent catching fire or a very hot splash of a liquid melting the material. Is the cotton content high enough for me to not have to worry about having molten polyester on my skin from some accident?

Ironically enough, a lab coat that was given to me from a university actually contained 80% polyester and 20% cotton. To be honest there was little to no fire hazard involved anyway so it wasn't an issue. I do not want to use this lab coat though as I have a higher cotton content one anyway.

DOI: 10.2174/1385272043370087

Sorry if you got a paywall, try sci-hib.tw if you do.

This paper discusses various applications of Mg/MeOH as a reduction system for various things. Seems pretty versatile.

I tried a reduction very similar to the first example in scheme 58. sp2 bridge protons have disappeared. I am expecting the new sp3 bridge protons to appear at ~2-3 ppm in 1H nmr, but it is not observed. Instead there is new resonance at~1-1.5 ppm. Normally I would chalk it up to grease, and maybe it is. The material needs a bit more purification to be fair.

Does anyone here have experience with these conditions? Something happened to the sp2 bridge C's/H's, since the resonance is gone, but the NMR result is not what I would expect (doesn't have signal for benzyl protons). I do not have access to a mass spec at the moment unfortunately.

These are 6 and 5 measurements respectively I took of two separate long glass tubes. And the measurements are in order of me taking them. EVERY TIME I weigh anything the first time I put it on the scale it’s the heaviest it’ll be in the series of measurements. It’s weird too because I’ll move from one 33.5-something gram tube to a 33.0-something gram tube and again. THE FIRST MEASUREMENT I TAKE ON THE NEW TUBE IS THE HIGHEST, and then it always drops from there. It seems like every time I start weighing the tubes I have to take 7 or 8 measurements to get semi-accurate results, and they just drop sequentially! Like, I get if if there’s a really big range and the scale’s not that accurate. That’s explainable. But why the predictable drop in mass? Is the first measurement accurate? The last?

I'm a fresh grad (May 2020). I recently got a job doing QC chemistry at a large company, working with medical devices (IV therapy solutions). I use a variety of methods and instruments to test solutions to see if it satisfies an assay target. I mostly work with titrations, UV-vis, AA, HPLC, UPLC, ICP-MS, GC, and flame photometry. The work definitely still interests me, but I'm thinking about how I can leverage this opportunity for my career in the future. I am gaining lots of great instrumentation experience and cGMP experience. The job is in the pharma industry, so documentation is also something that I've been adapting to and learning.

I am mostly thinking about graduate school to boost opportunity and pay. My current plan is to go back to school after 1-2 years of experience to get a MSc in Analytical Chemistry or Polymer Science, and move back to industry as an R&amp;D chemist (better pay, more freedom to make mistakes and develop methods). What I'm not too sure about is how I can transition into R&amp;D successfully. Is getting a MSc good enough to easily transition myself into R&amp;D?

Another question I have is: how does this career path fare compared to the others? I am considering a jobs such as a data verifier, method validations/development, or management.

i tried to make tert-butyl butyrate, and failed depressingly after so much work and money.

to a flask cooled to 0 C, I added 50 mL dichloromethane, 0.05 mol butyric acid, 0.003 mol DMAP (6 mol %), 0.15 mol tert-butyl alcohol, and after making sure the mixture was at 0 C, I slowly added about 0.06 mol n,n-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide over 5 minutes. After allowing to warm to room temp, the mixture was already opaque with white precipitate.

After 3 hours I gravity filtered to remove dicyclohexylurea precipitate, then washed the filtrate with 25 mL of 0.5 M HCl (might not be enough to neutralize all the bases) and 25 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. I dried with MgSO4. I started distilling and the result here was saddening. tert-butyl butyrate should boil between 135-137 C. After all the DCM distilled over, a small amount of liquid was distilling around 70-100 C, which I collected just in case. i didn't get a new liquid distilling until some random burnt-smelling crap come over between 150 C and 180 C. It separated into two layers in the beaker. Whatever all this crap is, it definitely isn't just the ester, but I definitely smell something fruity that smells like an ester.

1999,hsql84,What should I do with my degree? What did you do with your degree?,"I know.. this gets asked a lot. 

I love learning, like seriously it’s my greatest pleasure, and I’ve been drawn to science for a very long time. 

I will be graduating next semester with a BS in chemistry with minors in physics and math. I’ve done very well throughout my time here in college, and my grades reflect this. 

I’ve had two research projects during the past three years, the first of which was in a biophysics lab where I worked with python and a camera to take and analyze images of sterols and phase separation (about 800 hours worth of experience). 

My second research experience has been in a physical chemistry lab where I’ve been working with the formation of radicals via laser pulse to find reaction constants. (About 400 hours of experience) 

Needless to say I enjoy physics, coding and chemistry, however I don’t think I want to be in a lab for the rest of my career.

I see the most common answer for this question is to get a Ph.D, but I know you have to be committed to the degree to get the degree, but as of now am not committed to doing so. My time as a McNair scholar and researcher  has given me a lot of information on the intricacies of graduate schooling and it’s just not me. 

I know this degree isn’t one you get to make money, and I’m not looking to make six figures, just enough for a comfortable life and a family. 

With that, I ask you all, especially those who are interested in physical chemistry what you’ve done with your degrees.


Did you get a Ph.D? If so, does your job pertain to your research? 

Are you still researching?


Are any of you coders? Teachers? Managers?  If so, How do you like it? 

For those of you who have decided on chemistry adjacent fields or completely different fields entirely, has your education transferred well into your jobs?

2009,hsm1wl,"My friend liked my explanation of alkali and alkali earth metals, so enjoy","##Group 1
Lithium: mysterious, mildest of spicy metals. Can exist in metallic form, cut with a butter knife and float on water. Synthetically useful, substitutes unhappily for hydrogen and makes fancy bases.
Sodium: smallish +1 cell currency, no longer a useful metal here and beyond.
Potassium: bigger +1 cell currency. 
Rubidium: I Can't Believe It's Not Potassium
Caesium: the single most electropositive metal, Fluorine of metals, rips itself and everything else apart getting rid of its electron, also is Too Large and stops up cells. 
Francium: nope, doesn't exist

##Group 2
Beryllium: excellent metal, too small to exist? Extremely toxic, alien, we should be so lucky as to use it.
Magnesium: stable enough to use as a metal, still dangerously oxidizable. Body's smallish +2 cell currency. Great at making rocks and alloys alike.  
Calcium: magnesium without the metallic utility, lorge and chonky, great at making rocks like bone or gypsum. Larger +2 cell currency. 
Strontium: dense calcium. Stronks your bones. Clogs your heart cells. Risky improvement.
Barium: incredibly chongky, absorbs radiation, also insoluble normally but gives you mega lead style poisoning when soluble
Radium: fake calcium, a spy, not to be trusted, bright but toxic, excellent rogue, masquerades as useful and will kill you several ways at once.",2,2020-07-16 19:44:54,chemistry

Hi, a few days ago I was told to use brake cleaner at work for a task. (the product is ’eurol brake cleaner spray’ which contains n-hexane etc.)

The area I used the brake cleaner in was underground (not well ventilated) and a bit bigger than a classroom. I had gloves, not rubber gloves, but just regular work gloves. I sprayed the brakecleaner in very small amounts as I was supposed to scrape some stickers off some shopping carts.

So I basically sprayed a very little amount on the sticker, then scraped it off with a knife and proceeded to the next sticker/cart. I sprayed the can maybe a total of 15 times during the 25 minutes I was doing the task and the sprays were basically small ’clicks’ so as little of the stuff came out as possible. So after the 25 minutes of sitting there I stood up and  noticed that I felt dizzy. Then I started googling and apparently the stuff is really toxic which made me panic.

I spent the rest of the work day in the opposite side of the room, about 15 metres away from the spot I sprayed the brake cleaner in and the dizziness was slowly fading away after that. But I still felt a bit weird for the rest of the day

I read about all kinds of nerve damage and such that the brake cleaner can cause and I had no idea until I got dizzy and didn’t use the stuff after that. So am I fine? The only symptom I felt during that day was the dizziness, but I'm very anxious about it.

Valence is a a measure of combining power.  
Formal charge  - is a charge assigned to an atom in a molecule (under some assumption).  


A radical - an atom, molecule or ion that has an unpaired valence electron.

So valence says how many electrons an atom have (to share with another atom, which is constant), but  the formal charge and Number of Radicals is more or less the same thing. Is it correct?

I would really appreciate any comments on that issue.

I worked in a pharmaceutical plant cleaning the big portable tanks the product is made in. We hook them up to a system that uses caustic and acid in different cycles to clean out the stainless steel tanks. We use 55 gallon drums of a phosphoric acid solution and a potassium hydroxide solution. 

Each drum has a wand that extends the length of the barrel to pull solution into the system. I've always been told that if you move a wand into the incorrect barrel and screw it into a sealed position it could cause a catastrophic failure of the barrel and potentially explode. 

The guy who told me this doesn't seem like the most intelligent person and I highly doubt the small amount of solution coating the wand would be enough to cause such an effect but I'm not necessarily educated in the subject.

I have been collecting records for decades and have always considered pops and crackling as accepted aspect of the medium until recently, when I learned of using ultrasonic cleaners (USC) to clean record albums. I have a 35khz cleaner and have very good results but, even after 30-60 minutes in the cleaner, some pops and crackles remain. I imagine I need something to weaken the chemical bond holding crud in the grooves.

I've cleaned using a ""ultrasonic cleaning agent for records"" that came with my unit but offers no indication of active agents. It creates a few too many bubbles for my liking.

I've cleaned at 80*, 100*, 113*, 120*, and 140*. Above 130* the records seem to warp while in the bath but are perfectly fine after they cool.

I have searched many message boards for good information on record cleaning agents but for everything I find, I'll also find something to contradict it. Using distilled water as a base is nearly universally accepted but, some people even contest that.

I have no patience for uber audiophiles and thier claims of this and that. I want to know what scientists think.

All modern records are polyvinyl chloride (PVC). I imagine its pretty resilient stuff, but Google ""cleaning pvc"" and you'll find mostly plumbing sites.

- If you had an ultrasonic cleaner and wanted to clean your record albums, what would you use in the bath?
- Would you possibly apply an agent directly to the album prior to entering the USC? If so, what agent and how long (minutes, hours, days)?

I've seen suggestions of growing algae at home with an aquarium pump to scrub a bit of CO2. But eventually the algae needs to be removed and reseeded to keep absorbing. But when that extra algae gets thrown away, will it simply release the captured CO2 again as it rots? Or does it stay locked?

I've also heard of Olivine being able to sequester CO2, but it needs to be moved around to stop it forming a crust that prevents CO2 from being absorbed. large scale they consider doing this on beaches, but would a home tank with a slow stirrer work on a small scale? Or would it consume more energy that it's worth? Basically, is this viable?

I did not toast the pits first (which I now know would have denatured the amygdalin and kept it from producing cyanide?), and now I’m worried that drinking this could kill me!

Is there a way to heat/treat the liqueur now and save the batch? I’m not familiar with how the amygdalin &gt; cyanide conversion works, but I’ve read that heating up amygdalin would prevent the cyanide from forming. If this is true, what temperature does that happen at? (Hoping it’s a lower temp than what would burn off alcohol, but that’s less important)

I also read that amygdalin hydrolyzes when exposed to water and produces cyanide. If this is the case, then is it already too late? I assume then it would have reacted with the water in the vodka and the cyanide is already present. Any way of “cooking out” the cyanide?

I know it’s probably easiest to just toss this batch, but I stubbornly would love to save it if possible!

Currently taking free online courses on cosmetic formulation due to interest in skin/hair care, debating on whether to do a master's in PC due to a wider job opportunity, and a different industry to lean back to in case I wanted a career switch. I am interested in the business internship opportunities from the CS and PF program but unsure if it would help me secure a job in those respective countries as an international.   


Context:  
I've been out of school for about a year now with a Biochemistry degree (US), graduated without much working experience and had to move back to my home country due to error in visa application. Currently unable to find any relevant job without 2+ years in the industry. I initially planned on applying to a Medical Lab Scientist program, thus I mainly took biology courses, a few health science courses with only organic chemistry courses and a physical chemistry course w/o lab. Currently regret not taking an analytical chemistry course to at least be considered in a chemistry job. Had minor research experience in lab and internship in food formulation (3 months).    


When applying for jobs in my country(ASIA), the industry available are food/chemical/pharmaceutical manufacturing companies which required specific science degree such as food science, chemistry, engineering, nutrition, agriculture or pharmacy.  The typical job post in QA and regulatory positions would accept bioscience degree but wanted people with either years of experience or unskilled worker(high school leaver) in production line. The select few bioscience students that managed to enter those industries are either lucky (nepotism+networking) or have worked overseas a few years due to their postgraduate work visa. Majority of the bioscience degree holder I talked to went into sales before jumping into another industry unrelated to science. I tried applying for CRO (contract research organization) jobs but with no success since they much prefer people with a health science background.   


TLDR: Due to unfortunate circumstances on my visa, I had to leave US, and all the opportunities available to a Biochemistry degree holder. Without an industry demand for bioscience in my home country (Asia), I need advice on whether to get a Master's in Pharmaceutical Chemistry or Product Formulation/Cosmetic Science to diversify my career pathway/hiring opportunities in pharmaceutical/FMCG industry.",0,2020-07-13 10:01:25,chemistry

So what are the most abundant molecules on earth if we

* exclude ionic bonds, minerals, metals, ions
* count polymers of different lengths as one type of molecule
   * even if they have different monomers (protein, DNA, ...)
* sort by mass

I think the list should look something like this, with high uncertainty about the order

* water
* S8 (I know, you could say it is a rock too)
* nitrogen
* oxygen
* CO2
* cellulose
* lignin
* protein
* phospholipids (any particular?)
* dna
* methane
* whater the most common alkane in oil is

2287,hplz8v,Chemistry Jobs in Environmental Sustainability,"Hi r/chemistry,

I had a quick question about chemistry jobs in the field of sustainability/green energy and all that jazz. Apologies in advance if job questions are shunned (could not find anything in the rules).

Minor background, I have almost completed my Bachelors degree in Forensic Science with a major in Chemistry. After completing an internship/research project with the state police, especially during the current BLM protests, I have sort of lost my motivation to work with the police directly. I've always had an interest in renewables, sustainability and anything really related to that field. It also seems like a great industry to work in that gives back and has a good impact on the world around us

So my main question would be what are the chemistry related jobs in this area? I'm still doing a preliminary search into the area but I thought reddit would be a good place to ask as some of you might already be working in these areas, or know way more about it.

Any advice is much appreciated.",0,2020-07-11 20:29:04,chemistry

2295,hpjbyz,Wall smell after treating mold,"Hey guys, I’ve had something on my mind for the past few months I can’t quite budge. I had some mold on my wallpapered walls some months ago, firstly I used washing up liquid and water to clean it, being the paranoid person I am I felt I needed something a little more appropriate to fully cleanse the area, so I purchased some astonish mold and mildew blaster spray as I heard good things about it and said it could be used on walls (and wallpaper but to do a spot test first). I sprayed it onto a cloth and wiped the walls down, then rinsed with a clean cloth and dried, then painted over, I did this a few times over to make sure it really cleaned that mold and got rid of any spores. I noticed a slight chemically, earthy smell as my bed is next to one of the walls and couldn’t figure out what it is, I also treated the wallpaper around my windowsills but that isn’t as prominent, maybe because its closer to the window and has aired out more? I feel it’s faded a little since I did the treatment a few months back but I can still smell it if I get my nose close to / pressed against the wall and sniff. The smell is more intense on the areas I cleaned the most and isn’t noticeable on the above or surrounding areas I didn’t use the spray which leads me to believe the spray has made it smell this way as it’s only really on the areas I used it on. There’s been no sign of mold coming back since either. So I have a few questions I need help with to ease my mind as I suffer with bad ocd and have stressful thoughts that the smell is mold mildew or that it’s going to come back:

Is it possible the smell is just the wallpaper, spray and paint combo? (The spray uses mainly bleach) and another wall I’ve painted recently which didn’t have any mold issues also kinda smells similar to the treated wall? 

Is it possible the mold could’ve gone behind the wallpaper even if there was only one or two small patches of it initially or because I wet the wallpaper even though I fully dried it and aired the room thoroughly before painting? I’ve never had any leaking issues in the wall as far as I’m aware, I think I got it initially due to condensation and not opening windows.

Is there any way to get rid of the smell and is it something to worry about? I can’t usually smell it unless I get close, but as I mentioned it’s extremely stressful to me even though sounds insane! I just need some peace of mind by someone who knows what they’re talking about. I’ve also seen a few posts on here and quora of people claiming there’s a bleach smell on their walls after using mold spray. If it’s a normal thing then I’ll feel a lot better!

2330,hp400v,Information on Polyurethane (HDPE) in the Presence of Isobutane Gas?,"Recently, I've been researching polymer extrusion, specifically common household polymers. One that caught my eye was of course polyurethane (HDPE, rather), as it's common to find bottles with the ""2"" recycling symbol around the house.

I noticed that polyurethane could be dissolved in isobutane, also known as refrigerant R-600A, which is fairly easy to obtain and has a boiling point around 11F, which means it could easily become a liquid when put into a freezer. I know that it's also used as a propellant in aerosols and other applications.

I thought it might be interesting to see if polyurethane could be extruded by mixing it with the liquid form of isobutane and thus dissolving it, then bringing the vessel (a vessel capable of holding high pressure, mind you) to room temperature and extruding through a valve at-will (i.e. a solenoid valve). Potentially, a surfactant could be added as well, but the mixture wouldn't be atomized.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to find any information on how polyurethane would fare in this situation, specifically after brought to room temperature. For extrusion to take place, it would have to be in a liquid state, wouldn't it? That would mean another medium would have to be used, right (such as acetone)? (In that case it wouldn't even necessarily be worth using isobutane, as the HDPE could just be dissolved and a mild heating system could be used to evaporate off the acetone) Can HDPE even be dissolved in this way with isobutane?",8,2020-07-10 23:33:44,chemistry

I need to get a regulator that will fit this tank and not explode or something. I am entirely new to all this.

I am looking at a [second-hand regulator](https://i.imgur.com/fItX8KY.jpg) on eBay called ""S-400 Gauge /Nitrogen Regulator Bottom Entry 2 bar Outlet 400 bar"" - it looks pretty old-school and solidly constructed.

The specs for the regulator say: ""S-400 Gauge /Nitrogen Regulator Bottom Entry 2 bar Outlet 400 bar.""

I'm assuming they have the entry and outlet pressures reversed? The tank I have is 200 bar, so this 400 bar regulator ought to fit it, right? But I can't see what kind of connector the regulator has.

Also, the tank itsself has a big wheel/handle on it, does this act as a regulator by itsself? Is the extra ebay regulator just to precisely control the output pressure? l I'm scared to turn it on to find out, it case I can't turn it off again!

It looks a lot like [this one](https://www.weldingdirect.co.uk/GCE---High-Pressure-Nitrogen-Regulator-S400-0-to-28-bar), which also says 400 bar, and crucially also says "" Inlet connection is a standard UK bullnose with a G3/8  outlet."" - it looks the same as the eBay one. **Are there different types of connectors I should be watching out for?**",1,2020-07-10 19:57:23,chemistry

Recently, I purchased a test for phosphate in water. What I didn’t realize is that it has the whole shebang for warning labels due to its three different reagents- toxic, highly flammable, harmful, corrosive, irritant, etc. The most concerning one, however, is the #2 phosphate reagent that has the label “harmful for the environment”. And even worse, the box and instructions are useless for suggesting how to dispose of both the reagent and test after it’s done- it just states to clean the test tube with clean water.

The bottle states that it contains Antimony Potassium Tartrate. I assume this binds with the other reagents (reagent #1 has 10% sulfuric acid apparently, and #3 is a company secret I guess), as well as the 5 mL of water from the tank which you put in the test tube. To test, three drops of the antimony reagent are put in the tube in total.

I’m not familiar with this chemical at all so I don’t know how it would bond with the other reagents and with water.

I understand that there is a significant portion of silica in sand, and that one way to produce silica gel is by performing a sol gel method on rice husk ash. 

I studied law at university so my knowledge in chemistry is limited. I would like to start an environmentally friendly business that utilises waste and turns it into something useful like silica gel. I am exploring the various uses of silicon as one of the elements in the periodic table in whatever form it can be converted to, be it in liquid, solid, or granular state.

We then tried a slime made with Guar Gum and Borax and it was nearly identical. The only difference is this home made slime is more translucent and after 3 days it reverts back into pure liquid when storing in an air tight container. 



Scouring the internet didn't provide me with much, other than different articles using the same ingredients, so I am hoping some chemists here might have an idea as to why our home made solution doesn't retain the consistency as the store bought slime.

However, when I googled Nitrate, I found N was singled bonded to two O atoms (both O atoms had a -1 charge) and double bonded to the other O atoms (thus the N had a +1 charge). It has three resonance structures with each O taking a turn with the double bond.

In both my structure and the actual structure, 24e- were present (5 from N, (3)*6 from the 3 O’s, and one from the - charge = 24). 

With this in mind, why is my structure for Nitrate wrong? I get that in mine N is bonded to 5 things (two double bonds, one single bond) which is more than an octet, but I thought this was okay since N wants to lose 5e- to look like the noble gas He (or N could gain 3e- to look like Ne, but this seems hard to do when paired with an electronegative atoms like O and doesn’t N have a 5+ charge in Nitrate anyway so wouldn’t losing 5e- make more sense).",6,2020-07-09 12:01:56,chemistry

While working in the zinc lab, my head developmental chemist, who taught me a lot while working with ICP-OES, advised me to run black coffee through the system if I started getting internal standard failures or unusually high results on certain trace metals, as he said the caffeine in the coffee would clean residual metals out of the lines. Before you say “why not just change your tubing?” I know. But it worked a lot of the time when followed by a thorough diluent wash phase, and took less time than changing the tubes, breaking them in, recalibrating, etc. 
I’m curious if anyone can advise me on whether this has any validity, as my current lab is having some trouble with GFAAS and high Al results. One guess was that there could be Al contamination in the autosampler. Fortunately, we produce caffeine citrate for injection, so if the coffee/caffeine solution has any validity, then we could just make a pure caffeine solution to cleanse the autosampler lines on our Perkin Elmer GFAAS.

I recently started a newsletter focusing on battery innovation in the research and commercial world. I'm working with a friend and ex-classmate who's doing his PhD at Oxford working on battery materials.

Would really appreciate some feedback / comments, or how we can improve! If it looks interesting, please sign up too!

When we're talking about something like a biomarker, we know there is a set point(s), a range through which a corrective mechanism drives the equilibrium toward that set point, a magnitude of that drive and a timing of that process based on where we are relative to the set point, etc.

It strikes me that with the right assumptions one could pop in some variables and develop a more robust way to characterize the behaviour of that biomarker in terms of its existence in a homeostatic system. Does such a framework exist? Is this more/less appropriate for chempros?

I've just got a quick concept question. I know that Hybridization is just a model, it doesn't have any orthogonal sets anymore and therefore doesn't solve the stationary Schrödinger equation. But, since there is always the possibility to construct new sets of orbitals by a unitary transformation of the original occupied canonical orbitals my question was, if hybrid orbitals are part of this localized model as well? 

If I do localization to natural bond orbitals or Pipek-Mezey, I also get bonding situations that resemble the situation in VSEPR to some extend but for those I know that although the single orbital energies created are of no importance, the total wave function should have the same energy as the canonical one due to the unitary transformation.

So the question remains, is this sp³ hybridization for example also a unitary transformation of the canonical orbitals and can I see them as localized orbital model, or how do I characterize them?",7,2020-07-07 04:08:33,chemistry

The aqua regia performed slightly better than the HCl and after heating, both solutions were yellow/orange in colour.

2569,hmcyei,In search of a demonstration video for lipid solubility of drugs,"Hi all,

First off, my apologies if this is the incorrect forum for this question--I am happy to be told to go elsewhere.

I'm a psychological researcher introducing herself to the pharmacology underlying psychoactive drugs, and I am running into some chemistry for which my BA and MA have not prepared me .  
One thing I am looking to learn more about is the ""olive oil partition coefficient"", which I have learned a little bit about from this textbook:  [http://catalogue.pearsoned.ca/educator/product/Drugs-and-Behavior-An-Introduction-to-Behavioral-Pharmacology-Books-a-la-Carte-8E/9780134405025.page](http://catalogue.pearsoned.ca/educator/product/Drugs-and-Behavior-An-Introduction-to-Behavioral-Pharmacology-Books-a-la-Carte-8E/9780134405025.page)

A summary of what I understand about it is

Lipid solubility is expressed as the olive oil partition coefficient, which is derived by:

1.	Add the drug to an emulsion made of ½ water and ½ olive oil

2.	Separate the oil from water

3.	Measure the amount of the drug in each solution

I'd like to understand the process in more depth, particularly, I'd really like to see the process illustrated by someone actually doing it. The sticky part is that I'm having a hard time finding any explanation online that specifically alludes to olive oil--I see it in scientific papers, but there's no step-by-step explanation. So, I can't find a video on youtube that has the ""olive oil"" component, but I did find this video in which I think is basically this process: [https://youtu.be/vcwfhDhLiQU](https://youtu.be/vcwfhDhLiQU)  
I want to make sure I am getting the right information from this video. It is entitled ""Liquid-liquid extraction (or separation)"", and there is no mention of olive oil or fat of any kind. Instead, they use some sort of ether, the name of which I can't make out from the voice over, so I'm at a dead end for google searching that... Secondly, there is a step in at the end in which the scientist uses a solidifier, and I am thrown as to what role that plays in the whole process.  
So, I am wondering, does this video essentially show the process to derive the ""olive oil partition coefficient"" if you substitute olive oil for ether? Is the ether the voice refers to an ""ether lipid""? I am not familiar with ether lipids, but the ""lipid"" part of the name makes me think it would be the ether most akin to fat/olive oil...[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ether)).

But I always wondered why don't people take note of all the readings before adding each drop  when they think they are near the end point? That way if you add a drop too much you at least have the reading before you added it and you could average the two readings before and after adding that fateful drop. Sure it won't be as accurate but that it why we repeat experiments anyways in some cases could be accurate enough if you are using a dilute standard solution.,6,2020-07-06 08:24:37,chemistry

2598,hm2h0i,Are most people doing calibration curves statistically incorrectly?,"I am originally a Bioengineering major who had to take a bunch of chem classes and then later did an MS in Biostat.

One of the very basic things we learned in the beginning is that during a linear regression by OLS the errors have to be independent and also homoscedastic (ie have constant *absolute* error across the range).

However, in a lot of data that arises in analytical chem, this is not the case. First of all people using serial dilution invalidates this right off the bat. I’ve worked with chemists and advised them not to use this method unless they are willing to do Linear or Generalized Linear Mixed Models. 

But besides that usually in most instruments the error increases with the value itself. The usual way to deal with it is Weighted Least Squares or alternatively some type of Generalized Linear Model with a Non-Normal distribution like the Gamma for proportional errors (const relative errors)


With all the emphasis in the gen chem curriculum on sig figs and absolute vs relative error it seems bothersome that this is a glaring error in the chem education. The most common method used for a Calibration curve is actuallt wrong. Many papers about this but its still uncorrected.

Same goes for the whole Michaelis Menten Lineweaver Burke plot that is mathematically invalid. Inverting Y manually distorts the errors, and its best to do a Normal GLM with an inverse link or equivalently a Nonlinear Least sq model. 

Why exactlt is this stuff perpetuated? It seems like this exacerbates the reproducibility crisis. i’ve seen lot of data where in fact OLS and ANOVA are totally inappropriate to use. The thing is ANOVA is an special case of OLS so has the same assumptions. In some cases people have data below the LOD and its a non-trivial advanced statistical task to deal with it

Please note that I'm not a chemist and do not understand chemistry. 

I like to pay attention to ingredients of soap and figuring out how different brands of soap use different kinds of ingredients, including anti-bacterial properties. 

I'm aware of Triclosan and Triclocarban which are said to be very toxic to the environment and can also make the bacteria resistant to antibacterial properties and become harmful to the immune system. 

Since then, I noticed that companies have been replacing Triclosan and Triclocarban with other ingredients which are said to be safer, but how much is it safer anyway? 

I notice one brand uses Chloroxylenol while another brand uses Silver Oxide. Other brands may use a different ingredient which I may have not noticed yet.

But how different are other antibacterial ingredients compared to Triclosan &amp; Triclocarban?

I watch lots of chemistry videos on YouTube (nile red, Cody's lab, nurdrage etc) and litterly no one calls it ethanoic acid ever. To my chemistry teacher's horror, I personally like to call it acetic acid. So I am wondering if anyone out there calls CH3COOH ethanoic acid. (Sorry if this question seems very primative, I am just a 15 year old who knows a tiny bit more about chemistry than my firends) Just for curiosity, could you also comment where you live as well as your preferred name. I live in the UK so maybe chemists here like to call it ethanoic acid.

I was basically wondering what type of projects I can do on my own time now that I'm on summer break that can actually be useful and pertinent for my CV, and also something that can potentially get me more involved in chemistry (I'm aware that there's not much a student my age can do alone that will be revolutionary, but something interesting requiring me to learn more than I know now).

I know most side projects in science require skills in coding, which is why I started learning Python but I saw that most computational chemistry-type side projects are done on C++ rather than Python, but I'm not too sure.

- Have you been isolated into a single industry, or have you been able to move to new jobs/specialities?
- Have you been hiring new graduates during the pandemic?
- Would you recommend pursuing a PhD before/during/after a career?

Recent Graduates:
- What is the job market like right now from your experience?
- Are you set on something specific, or are you casting a wide net?
-What platforms are you using for your job search?

Then add another 200ml DH2O right before adding 50 mg of mercuric chloride which by the way I had to buy from Russia and it took like 7 months to get here bought a 50g package thinking it would last forever. My dumass added 50 grams which created in it an explosive amalgamation reaction of super toxic Mercury chemicals. The end result was kind of worked but instead of getting an orange oil freebase it was yellow as was my precursor. You certainly Cross or do you know what I'm talking about so please don't be a square and flag this I just have one question. Is it possible to over amalgam aluminum since I was the only process I effed up.

2816,hjhay7,Undergrad chem - what subject to minor in?,"I'm starting my 2nd year of my undergraduate chemistry degree in the US, and I'm thinking of minoring in either **physics or math**. I'm not as interested in the biology-related aspects of chem at the moment, so those are my options which I see fit for me. It's worth mentioning that I'm minoring for the extra knowledge, not for the extra line on my diploma. I'm also intending to go to grad school and go the research route, if that affects anything (I know full well that can change later of course).

**I'm wondering if any of you have an opinion about which subject is better to minor in.** I'm leaning towards physics, since it gets me greater understanding and detail of physical chemistry and spectroscopy and related areas, and also can extend my knowledge of how chemistry can be applied/combined with other areas. On the other hand, while math is used in chemistry, it seems very unlikely that I'm going to, say, develop new mathematical methods that are usable in chemistry. The usage of math in chemistry seems to already be established, and while taking more math (lin alg, diff eq) will make me familiar with it in p-chem classes, I feel that it's not as directly applicable to research in the long run. But, I've heard people say that mathematical thinking/knowledge in general is valued, so who knows. I could also do a minor in one and add in a couple classes from the other. I have enough room to make that happen while leaving room for research without overloads. I know that research is more important than getting a minor.

I'll note here that I've taken multivariable calculus and one class each of linear algebra and differential equations, but not the ones higher than that. I'll definitely have to review linear algebra.

That's my thought process. Of course, I've had very little exposure to contemporary chemistry research, so I'm probably under-informed about all of this, and it's why I'm posting this here.

P.S. There's also the option of doing an astronomy minor, which would be partly for fun, but astrochemistry is a thing and it seems pretty interesting. Not sure how much impact it'll have though.

Being passionate about understanding how things works from scratch, i find it overly annoying when the access to the practical learning of disciplines, because of elitism, darwinism, market, historical bigotry and other reasons, is blocked to the general population by the hypercomplication of language, as it mostly happens with science.. 
Anyways, It is not my intention to start here a conversation about the predisposition of different ""kinds"" of brains for different types of languages and consequent construction of theory and knowledge transmission in our current system.. 
so here’s my question for you chemistry language connaisseurs:

how is resin, and more specifically epoxy resin, made? 

I found online that the process consists in heating up different types of hydrocarbons to separate molecules, then polymer compounds are built in order to create a specific resin,
 yet, in cave-man language, where do hydrocarbons are found in nature and how do the extraction works?

Sulphur's oxidation number increases from +4 to +6 and SO2 is the reducing agent, so SO2 is oxidized. But i'm used to thinking about the reducing agent as the species that loses electrons so it bothers me seing that -2 charge in the sulphate ion, it makes it seem that SO2 gains electrons in this reaction, instead of losing them.  How can I think correctly about this?

2826,hjcqk3,Deciphering the chemistry behind a century old experiment,"Recently, it was found why liquid ammonia, when reacted with the alkali metals, gives a bronze-like substance.

Delving deeper into the experiment: it was found that the ammonia molecules pulled electrons from the alkali metals, which are known for being highly electropositive. These electrons, called solvated electrons got trapped between the ammonia molecules, giving a blue solution. As the concentration of the solvated electrons increased, a bronze-like substance formed with the typical properties of a metal. And as the scientists said, it was a genuine metal.

This finding can be the start of something big because similar metallic structures can be formed using different solutions. The questions this raises are:-

1.) Does this present to us a host of new resources? Because rather than exhausting typical metals, these reactions can give similar alternatives.

2.) Does this mean that all those alloy making processes that are carried out in furnaces will reduce? Because in that case, we will be making very sustainable use of energy.

3.) Instead of ammonia, can we also use amines or other bases? Not even bases, but other substances in general that can give room for solvation.

Would love to discuss this further with whoever finds it interesting!

I am doing a comparative study examining the most prevalent methods of suicide in different countries around the world, and how to best educate the public, and enforce some kind of laws on the ease of obtaining these chemicals OTC or online.**

This specific method involves mixing toilet detergent (containing some concentration of HCl) with a lime sulfur mixture, to produce hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). This was “popularized” in Japan circa 2008, claiming that a concentration of more than 1000 ppm of H2S will render a person unconscious within one inhalation and cause a painless death within 2-3 seconds.

This notorious site that I found on web archives caused around 500 “detergent suicides” in Japan in 2008 alone. (Please use Google Translate if you don’t speak Japanese.)

https://web.archive.org/web/20090122204821/http://jisatsu.yi.org/

Thankfully the site was taken down quickly, and the number of cases have dropped, but all the ingredients are still readily available on Amazon.

For my research, from this sub anyway, I would simply like to know the balanced chemical equation (or several of them depending on the mixture of lime sulfur?) that causes this reaction.",7,2020-06-30 15:46:54,chemistry

This ring is an 18K yellow gold ring which I've had for over a year and half. Two-three weeks ago, I noticed that my gold ring looked matte silver, almost pewter like. The shine was gone and the ring's color was completely gone, no spotting nor streaks. Looking this phenomenon up, I learned that gold could lose oxygen and the absence of the oxygen causes the metal to look ""silver"". It went on to say that after sometime, the metal will regain the oxygen bringing the color back. Well low and behold, after two weeks the yellow is slowly coming back into the ring. This is absolutely bizarre to me and need to find out how this happened! Is this material even gold?

2911,hihzk0,"Is there a way to break down/etch this specific nano coatings, containing: 3-Aminopropy-ltriethoxysilan?","I am wondering if there is a way to break down/etch a solution of the following chemicals:

2-Butoxyethanol 111-76-2 1-99% F 20,21,22,36/3 3-Aminopropy-ltriethoxysilan 919-30-2 1-30% Xn, C 34,22 n-Butanol 71-36-3 1-30% Xn.Xi 10,22,37/38-41

Basically a way to eat through these compounds when this is applied to plastic or metal. Any help would be much appreciated.

I am aware the aminopropyl-triethoxysilane is what makes the coating. The other two are likely just solvents or carriers used in preparing the coating (they are liquids at room temperature).

To break down a cross-linked siloxane coating I am thinking about using a dilute solution of TBAF or NaOH at room tempersture.

The only issue is that I will be using a dauber made out of HDPE plastic container to hold the chemical solution, however won't TBAF eat through the HDPE plastic dauber container? Or are there certain plastics resistant to TBAF I can use? If so how dilute must the TBAF solution be in water?

I am wanting to make a solution that will deprotect/etch the 3-Aminopropy-ltriethoxysilan present in the nano coating; with a solution of various solvent based dyes ( as I am wanting to make a dye based ink solution which is able to etch through the 3-Aminopropy-ltriethoxysilan present in the nano coating ) E.g: Solvent Black 27 + Alcohol + TBAF. I am wanting to make a solution with either these compounds in a dauber bottle made of HDPE plastic. I am wondering if the compounds produced would eat through the nano coating and at what rate?

I do not mind if it damages the underlying coating as I am looking to etch the underlying surface using a dauber to apply it easy on both plastic and metal nano coated surfaces at room temperature. Would conc. aqueous caustic soda and left on the surface work to eat through the chemical coating? Likewise would a dilute aqeuous solution of TBAF at room temperature do the same thing, without damaging the dauber made of plastic? And what concentrations is enough to be needed? 

I was suggested by another user that the following solutions would be able to etch/break down the above nano coating:


Camphorsulphonic Acid in Methanol (1:1 molar ratio) which is effective in minutes,

p-Toluene Sulphonic Acid : Pyridine : Methanol : DCM (1:1:8:2 molar ratio) which is effective inside an hour.

HF : Pyridine : THF (1 : 5 : 5 molar ratio) which is effective in 8 ish hours and needs to be done in HDPE, or PTFE

TBAF : Glacial Acetic Acid (1 : 1 molar ratio)

However I can find no resources online which suggest this would break down/etch through my specific nano coating. (And I would rather not want to use HF in the solution due to how dangerous it is handling it)

The reason for me wanting to do this project is to combine chemistry with art.
As I plan on spraying a plastic and metal surface with the nano coating and letting it fully dry.
And then attempt to apply an ink nano coating etching solution to the surface with a dauber.

So which would be the safest way chemically to etch through the 3-Aminopropy-ltriethoxysilan based nano coating?",11,2020-06-30 01:40:17,chemistry

Like if I had two fireplaces and one i started with a bic lighter [not butane] and one i lit with a butane torch. Does one stay hotter? Or average out after ignition.

2988,hhlfso,Should I get a Ph.D," 

I am a recent college graduate; I received my bachelor’s degree in chemistry this past December. I’m working as a Process associate for a large pharma company in Cambridge MA. My plan was to work for a few years and then go back for my Ph.D. However, I am questioning if it is even worth it for me to go back, I really enjoy my job. And I even see this being my career and, to be honest, I don’t really enjoy academia at all. And if I got a Ph.D I would go back to industry anyway.

Also, I have a lot of student debt, over 100K, and it scares me. I make good money 70K, benefits and annual bonuses, and a 401K. going to grad school would mean losing all of this and 5-7 years of making no money. This also means for 5-7 years I probably won’t be able to make loan payments. So does it make sense to give all of this up for a Ph.D when I’m already working in the career I want to do?

I understand that there is a glass ceiling with only having a bachelor’s degree, but how bad is it? I know people with a Ph.D. usually move away from lab work, but That is what I enjoy most of my job. And I have a few co-workers who only have a bachelor’s degree and they are at the associate scientist position. Is that the highest position with a bachelor's degree?

Also, I know this should not be my reason to go back, but both my parents are pushing me to go back to school. My mom was not happy when I decide not to go directly into grad school, she was crying. For the record neither of my parents have Ph.Ds or even work in science. My dad never even went to college. So, this has been a hot button issue for a while, but it only got better because I said I would go back after working for a little bit. So, I am not looking forward to having that conversation with them again.

Any advice would be helpful. Thank you!",11,2020-06-28 15:09:38,chemistry

I received an email from the department chair yesterday, in which he offered to waive two classes that are otherwise required for the Environmental Chemistry degree I've been workings towards. One of them is a senior level Marine Science fieldwork class, which I was actually going to ask to be waived anyway as the subject material of that class is something I've already been doing to assist in the research of the Marine Science chair. The other class is a class on meteorology, which will be offered next spring. One I complete those two courses next spring I will be finished with my bachelors. 

Now here is the question: do I waive meteorology and graduate a semester early, and use online resources to teach myself meteorology? Or do I stay and take the course, and find other interesting classes to take as otherwise I'd be commuting to school for that class only? Otherwise, would it be feasible to ask if there's a possibility to do it as an independent study course where I can still graduate a semester early but at least get some credit for learning the material?

I'm not entirely sure what the course entails and it's only offered once a year as there aren't many people who need it (there are maybe 6 EnviroChem majors tops at my school including myself), but I don't want to risk shortchanging myself when it comes to job applications as Marine chemistry and atmospheric chemistry are my main interests.",4,2020-06-28 11:32:43,chemistry

So, I have this puzzle from a videogame that asks us to convert 24 chemicals into formulas using the Hill notation. Then one of the elements inside said formula is part of a set of letters. At the bottom of the picture I attached to this post there's 2 letters that have already been filled in as a clue for whoever is trying to solve this.

The issue here is that, based on the pre-filled letters, this puzzle uses Hill notation following certain exceptions.

I'd like to know if anyone has a clue as to what the correct formatting for these formulas may be, as I've found about 3 different representations for every compound in the list, and have no idea which one follows the Hill notation as close as possible considering all exceptions. I've left a table with all my theories attached to this post as well.

My question is: somehow this particular lab did not get a sink in the plans. There is a wash room directly next to the lab with a sink in it, but the lab itself does not have a sink.

This feels not ok to me, but i can’t articulate it beyond people should be able to wash their hands, and generally have easy access to running water. There is a chemical shower in the lab as well, but to me that is only for use in a catastrophic accident. If I spill a small drop of Formic acid on my skin, I’m going to be running to a sink not a chemical shower. The pushback I am getting is that there is a sink in the room next door.

3090,hfyeae,Looking for a demonstration that LOOKS like a cloud in a bottle (not the common one that looks like fog in a bottle). I’m thinking it would need to be a liquid system to get the real billowy cloud look. Any suggestions?,"I’m looking for a demonstration or chemical system that can produce what looks like real clouds like you see in the sky, but in a bottle. I am very aware of the coming demonstration where you make an actual cloud (water vapor) in a bottle. But that’s not what I’m after. That doesn’t look like a cloud. It’s just an amorphous white fog because the whole bottle is at the same temperature, pressure, etc. That is definitely not what I’m after. 

What I want is more like a lava lamp but it makes what looks like billowy clouds. The main purpose is that I want it to be interesting and fun to look at, like a lava lamp, but with clouds.  I love watching real clouds, as many people do, and seeing a small version in a bottle would be mesmerizing. 

Here’s what I’ve considered so far, but haven’t found any system that looks promising yet. 

1. Would probably need to be a liquid system instead of a gas system. At this scale (in a bottle or large container) the diffusion and convection of a gas system would be too high and would not allow the defined form of a cloud that we see in the sky. 
2. An immiscible two liquid system might work with the clouds forming at the boundary layer. I’m recalling my graduate school days where I used the hydration of lipid layers that looked like tiny clouds to make micelles and liposomes. But they were much too small to be of any visual interest. Is there some set of phospholipid or other system that might produce billowy structures on a macro scale?
3. Maybe you can simulate the formation of clouds more directly with a solution-precipitate system that has a sensitive temperature dependency. I’m thinking you could have a tall column of the solution and put a small heater on the bottom and a peltier cooler on the top to create a temperature gradient within the liquid. If that temperature gradient spanned the transition temperature from solution to precipitate, you might theoretically get clouds forming at that transition point in the column. Then you might get solid ‘rain’ that falls down to the bottom where it goes back into solution because of the higher temperature at the bottom. Here are the problems I see with this method (besides not knowing of what system would be most suitable).  The temperature difference would likely create natural convective forces within the liquid that might disrupt the formation of defined clouds. Maybe if the liquid was very high viscosity you could limit that, but I’m not sure. The precipitation that formed would need to be close to the same density as the liquid so that it didn’t immediately sink to the bottom. 
3. Maybe a solid microparticle in suspension could be used as the cloud particles? Not sure how you would limit the diffusion of the particles though.

TL;DR, it's viciously toxic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, reasonably pyrophoric and decomposes explosively at its STP bpt. 

We had a visiting professor who decided to make a couple of moles after retro-ing his way back to a synthon for some cross-coupling that appeared to be neatly solved by this little beauty. He had quite the fire after carelessly disassembling his vacuum distillation rig, which is when we found out what he was up to... fortunately that lab used argon, not nitrogen, and only the paperwork was a killer.

Talk about a scale up; from the paper at 10mmol:

&gt;Warning - although we have used the following procedure repeatedly without the slightest incident, it is strongly recommended that all work with dichloroacetylene be conducted in a good hood and behind a safety shield.

I currently hold a CGPA of 3.87 (major: B.S. in Chemistry) and will be taking the MCAT this summer; however, I’ve changed my mind about entering med school (even though I’m a premed Chemistry student). 
What I really want is to just leave the country I’m currently in (for privacy I’m not gonna mention which country, but it’s not the U.S. even thought I mentioned the MCATs). My family and every other family in my country is currently suffering from an economic collapse and honestly without my scholarship I wouldn’t be able to attend uni. Anyways, I digress, the questions I have are:
1. What are my options at career paths with a B.S. in Chemistry?
2. I would like to get my Master’s degree abroad (preferably Europe) , can you recommend any good programs that offer aid and/or scholarships?
3. I am still studying for the MCAT even though I’m not going into med school, I really don’t know why I’m doing that; I’m maybe waiting for a Hail Mary.
4. I am extremely scared and lost in which direction I should go next, so I would really appreciate a couple words of encouragement or anecdotes if you’ve been in the same situation.

This toolbar contains the most common functions and commands that I use 90% of the time in ChemDraw and it makes the use of the program much more efficient. Additionally, it frees up a lot of screen space since most other toolbars are not necessary. 

A while back in a now almost forgotten post here, I shared instructions on how to create a custom ChemDraw toolbar. Recently, maybe because everyone is bored at home, I have received several requests for the files. So here is a link to a zip file on a Google Drive that contains the simple instructions and supporting files that are needed to create the custom toolbar shown above.

I tried asking around for a syllabus from a previous year so I can at least get a list of topics and what not, but that didn't work. Does anyone have any recommendations for books that I can look at that can help me prepare? I've been searching for some but most of them seem to steer toward the graduate level courses

If this helps in anyway - in orgo 2, I learned about these reactions (in this order): alcohols, ethers, organometallics (Grignard, Gilman, and then we did stuff with carbenes), aldehydes and ketones, carboxylic acids and derivatives, enols and enolates, benzene derivatives

The only clues we have are the pictures and the results of a small test. We tried dissolving it in acid (HCl) and organic solvents and because it dissolved only in the organic stuff, we think that it itself is organic too. It floats on water and has a dark, blood-like color when desolved in ethanol or gasoline.  


We hope that someone heard of this stuff and/or can identify what it is based on the pictures.

Recently, I've been thinking about taking up more chemistry. I'm a BSc. in biochemistry, and have been about a year out of university, but have been reminiscing about how I neglected Orgo and decided to take a jab at learning it again - for no reason other than to enjoy it and build more intuition about chemistry for my degree. I already have the mere basics of Orgo remembered, what I think I should focus on is how to make the most *use* out of it.

Currently, the plan is to leaf through my copy of the Merck index, cherrypicking compounds which I think are at my level of comprehension, and studying their syntheses and pushing the arrows to the best of my ability (which may or may not require help from other resources/books/articles). 

Now, I understand that some of you would recommend Orgo-related textbooks or workbooks and go through the exercises. I tried those, but it's hard for me to commit to them. I lack focus. I think this sort of *meandering* is a strategy that will help me learn and keep me motivated.

I wanted to ask for your opinions (tell me I'm losing my mind, etc.), perhaps read some words of advice, or resources/books/articles (or even good mindful habits) you would like to share for a novice like me.

To do this, I would need software that can simulate covalent interactions between a drug and an enzyme. More specifically, the software in question must be capable of simulating bond breaking and bond formation during the course of the enzyme/drug interacion, so software such as pymol and autodock is not an option; I need QM/MM software. Does anyone happen to know of a QM/MM program that is free and publicly available, meaning that one does not have to be affiliated with a university or scientific organization to have access to the software?

3211,heon13,Will lime powder mixed with chlorine and or bromine tablets cause a harmful gas?,"I'm coming here to ask a professional or someone knowledgeable in chemistry about a combination of lime and chlorine, and or,  lime and bromine. My grandmother had a sewage backup and lucky me got the privilege to go into the crawlspace beneath the house to try and find the source of the problem. While under the house I noticed an abundance of flies and mosquitoes. When I made it to the point where I found water puddling, i noticed mosquito larva swimming. At the time I was just going to pour a little bleach in the puddle, but didnt have any on hand. I ended up throwing a handful of what was either chlorine or bromine tablets (common pool chemicals) in the puddle to eradicate the larva. 

Now after contacting the plumber who is going to fix the problem later this week, I was advised to use lime as a way to get rid of the odor. I refuse to put that down until I'm certain the mixture of chemicals wont cause a harmful gas that would make it's way into her house. And help would be appreciated.",5,2020-06-23 17:31:57,chemistry
3212,henzd8,Uneven column chromatography bands,"Has anyone ever experienced their bands looking like [this](https://imgur.com/a/OXetKHn)? 

I've been having problems separating a compound, the TLC Rfs are decent (~0.3 for target vs. 0.5 for major impurity). When I translate that to a column, though, the bands smear like crazy and the middle seems to elute much faster than the edges, almost like an upside down parabola. It's also not a problem of uneven loading, as I dry loaded on a very minimal amount of silica and was very careful when adding my eluent.

The solvent system is 5% MeOH in DCM, as the compound is a fluorescent dye, which is fairly large (&gt;500g/mol) and polar. The column is also definitely not overloaded (I used 15 mL of silica for 50 mg of crude product) and the flow rate is quite high (I've read the classic Stille paper and kept those principles in mind).",22,2020-06-23 16:56:38,chemistry

However, as both a lover of chemistry and someone who will need a thorough understanding of its foundational principles for my field, I want to refresh my memory and go into college-level chemistry as prepared as possible.

CHEM 1 includes a lot of the introductory/elementary stuff, such as *fundamental concepts, states of matter, periodic table, structure and bonding, stoichiometry, compounds of representative elements, oxidation-reduction, and solutions*.

It would also be helpful for me to read for CHEM 2 topics I have already learned about as well, such as *thermodynamics, electrochemistry, organic chemistry, reaction rates, and equilibrium*. These are all topics I’ve studied to some degree, but either don’t remember very well or never understood as much as I would have liked to.

3220,hemac0,I Need to Vent About Serological (TD/blow-out) Pipets,"I'm a chemist working in a biology lab, and there's a lot of things that biologists do differently than chemists. Some of them are minor, and some of them drive me absolutely nuts. 

Today, I'm going crazy because of serological pipets.

I was reading through the student's lab manual and it says, ""The pipets that are used for microbiological experiments are blow-out pipets... Pipets of this type are usually calibrated to TD (to deliver)."" Now, I saw this and immediately thought, ""well that's wrong."" However, I sometimes doubt myself, and since I know that biology can be funny, I decided to do some Googling. A lot of Googling.

I was right. But according to biologists, I'm wrong.

In ""normal"" chemistry, we have TC and TD, right? TC means ""to contain,"" so it contains the amount of liquid marked and you have to blow out the liquid in the tip of the pipet. TD means ""to deliver,"" and you never blow out the liquid in the tip, because it accounts for that.

Not so with serological pipets!

Nope. These pipets are marked at ""TD/blow-out"" (apparently Ostwald-Folin pipets - used mostly for blood sciences - are the same). So even though they're marked TD, they have the double rings at the top, indicating that they're blow-out. 

Gah.

I was complaining about this to my biologist boyfriend, and he just shrugged and was like, ""I know you're not going to like this, but accuracy just isn't that important and it probably isn't a big deal."" (That's another biology thing that drives me crazy). 

I've asked some other chemists, and they are similarly perturbed, so I feel less crazy for being so frustrated.",29,2020-06-23 15:25:36,chemistry

3302,hdtlwo,Isolation of MnO2 from dry Zn-C batteries,"I extracted a soil-like paste from some zinc-carbon batteries and as I've found out, it's MnO2 contaminated with carbon and both soluble and non-soluble salts. Getting rid of the soluble salts is easy, but I've got no clue as to how it's possible to separate the carbon. 

Heating the mixture would produce CO2, but MnO2 may be converted into Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, and bubbling pure O2 through a suspension of the mixture might take too long to fully oxidize the carbon. 

Would adding ClO- and OH- oxidize the MnO2 to MnO4- while leaving the C intact, thus allowing their separation and eventually the isolation of the MnO2 by reducting the MnO4-? What would your take be to obtain pure MnO2?

You might not agree with me but I feel that unless you're a lecturer or a tutor, over time you get to deal less and less with basic chemistry, I feel I don't get review it regularly and like anything in life that knowledge slowly fades away. on the other hand most of it obviously sticks around as things we take for granted once we deal with more intense subjects like biochemistry and molecular biology.

Do you get to review things you've learned over the years or do anything else that helps you feel like you've got it under control?

I glean from the world many things through observation but I lack all of your hard learned language and understanding. Please understand and do not judge my lack of knowledge as a lack of intellect.   


The problem. I have a health issue. It has to do with what is in the air when things are getting burned. I need to know the possible chemical compounds that could be present and mixed. I need to learn how to reliably test and sample said chemicals from the air so I can bring indisputable evidence to force investigative action. I need to be empowered with knowledge. I wont learn the chemistry from the ground up and will have hard days, as its effecting me physically and neurologically.   The doctors are having a hard time working on it, and its frustrating to say the least especially now with the pandemic.   


If I know what it is I can measure it, test it, and SEE IT! If I can identify I can also mitigate better through filtration as none of my lab hepa filters are working at all, even with carbon and zeolite scrubbers. Im trying. So much. If any one can help me figure it out and get on the road I need to defend and submit solid evidence to get help I would be forever grateful. Im not spiteful, im not trying to go after or hurt any one, and I cant move. I just want to be able to breathe every day and not wake up drowning in pain while my wife watches on crying.

3312,hdr9jv,Rounding Significant Figures and the Rule of 5 - Why We Round 3.25 to 3.2 and not 3.3,"I created a video that I explains the rules of rounding significant figures. If you’ve ever been confused as to why we round 5.05 to 5.0 and not 5.1, or 3.25 to 3.2 and not 3.3 (if you were asked to round to the nearest tenth), I hope this video will clarify that!

https://youtu.be/oZFnJ-fIQfA 

Basically, when you round off, your change the value of the number you are rounding. According to the old rules everyone knows, you round “up” 5 times (5,6,7,8,9) and you round “down” only 4 times (1,2,3,4). If you have a large data set and you need to round the numbers, you will be rounding up 5/9 times and rounding down 4/9 times. This can skew the data and potentially misrepresent results!

So in chemistry, we follow three rules of rounding significant figures, which I explain in my video around 4:27. 

I spend the rest of the time doing practice problems.

3332,hdfws1,Chemists/chemistry enthusiasts out there — tell me if this is impossible,"Hi, 

So I was formulating a skincare product that intends to restore and induce fermentation in the skin microbiome. I posted this in DIY Beauty, but I might have more luck here. Thanks in advance!

So basically, my formulation is mainly comprised of bioferments of ingredients like rice, and it contains several strands of lactobacillus and other probiotics. Basically the formulation is chock-full of active fermented microbes, but I need to preserve the thing. Some preservations, like phenoxyethanol, is an irritant. I've decided to go with Silver citrate + citric acid, and an anti-microbial lactobacillus strand. My question is, will these preservatives kill the beneficial probiotic strands/microbes in my product? They are broad-spectrum after all. I should probably ask this in biology, but stay with me, I have a chemistry thing in need of help. 

My formulation is currently this: 

Dionized water, MC-Glucan (10%), Dimethyl Isosorbide (10%), Lactococcus Ferment Lysate (10%), Makgealli Extract (7%), Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract (7%), Hydrolized Yeast Protein (7%), Amber Extract (7%), Ophiopogon Japonicus root extract (7%), Inulin (6%), Leucidal Liquid (4%), \[water, milk proteins, bilfida ferment lysate\] (4%), \[alpha-glucan oligosaccharides, P.S. root juice, maltodextrin, lactobacillus\] (4%), Gluconolactone (3%), Bio Chelate \[water, saccharomyces zinc, saccharomyces copper, saccharomyces magnesium, saccharomyces Magnesium, saccharomyces Iron, saccharomyces Silicon\] (2%), Hydrolyzed hemp protein (2%), Silverion \[silver citrate, citric acid\] (0.15%)

Any glaring mistakes? Luckily this is a water-based, oil-free project, so I didn't have to add emulsifiers. Any stabilizers necessary? I estimate the final pH (after adjusting, of course) to be 5.8. 

I'm worried about the amount of microorganisms in this, and the preservatives used. Will they kill all the beneficial microbes? Anyone know of a preservative/preservative system that is broad-spectrum, but is gentle and does not attack certain strains of commensialistic/beneficial bacteria?

I realize that was a kind of snoozy read, but if you have any suggestions/knowledge about cosmetic chemistry and bacteria, PLEASE reply!

I have an Honors degree in Chemistry. However, due to certain reasons during my senior year, I was not able to work on a Research Project/thesis.

Reasons being, my supervisor was not cooperative and did not teach me anything. Upon pointing out to her that we only had a few months left to present our results, she said I didn't come to the lab often enough! I visited the lab everyday. Eventually, she blocked my card so I wasn't able to enter the lab.

I don't have any research experience.

Q1) Applying to a Masters program usually asks for research experience. What should I do? Will a good GRE score compensate? 

Q2) Long term plan is to teach. I am currently tutoring a 10th grader online. Will a masters be beneficial in this case? Also, how can I find students to tutor online? 

Any help will be appreciated. I feel so helpless. Thank you",11,2020-06-20 07:34:01,chemistry

I know I want to study chemistry, likely on the academia side and definitely not chemical engineering. Researching as a pharmaceutical scientist/chemist seems like something I'd be really interested in.

That being said, my school offers a general chemistry degree and a chemistry degree with specialization in biochem. The biochem pathway has more biology/biochem classes (obviously) but no analytical chem and not as much pchem. The regular chemistry pathway includes one biochem course, analytical chem, and more pchem. Is there one that would be better-suited to continue into pharmaceutical chemistry in grad school?

Although I have time to pick a major (until the end of my 2nd year), I wanted to think ahead so I don't pick the wrong classes freshman year.

3419,hcdvtg,Laboratory anxiety,"I've been working in a laboratory for about a year now. I've always been a little nervous around chemicals and recently have been feeling anxious about working with certain chemicals in the laboratory. I always do my best to follow laboratory safety, wear the appropriate PPE, call the spill team when needed, etc. However, I'm worried about making mistakes that will impact others that I work with. Anyways, Something has been bothering me, so I wanted to reach out and clarify If I've done anything wrong. I've been working with acetonitrile for the past couple of months to work on a project. The glassware that I use must be rinsed with methanol and then acetonitrile, both of which evaporate very quickly. I usually place a tray in the fumehood, cover it with paper towel, and place the glassware on the tray to dry. I then take the tray and paper towel out of fumehood, and use it to carry around my samples from the bench top to the shaker. And then I use the tray to carry my rinsed dishes back to the wash up area. What I didn't realize was that I wasn't washing the tray after using it, and simply wiped it down with paper towel and put it away on a shelf for someone else to use If needed. I know that these solutions evaporate quickly. And I know that the glassware that I rinsed with methanol and acetonitrile is leaving the fumehood and sitting on the bench top, so it shouldn't really matter. Anyways, a supervisor asked me where I got the tray, since they're pretty useful, and I explained what I use it for. He muttered something about it being a potential health and safety risk by taking it out of the fumehood. And then said that since my results were good, I could just wash the tray with 70% ethanol. I was really confused by what he meant by it being a health risk and didn't bring it up again. Now I'm all paranoid about other people using the tray afterwards, because I never cleaned it after using it to dry my glassware that was rinsed with methanol and acetonitrile. I don't know why it's bugging me. Thoughts?",5,2020-06-19 21:13:05,chemistry

It was a very small amount, a few drops could be seen on the side of the bottle. I quickly placed the bottles in the fumehood. I checked for any spills and didn't see any. I think it may have evaporated. However, it was outside the fumehood and the hallway that the shaker is located in has alot of foot traffic during the day. I didn't tell my supervisors since they would probably look at me like ""There's no spill, what do you want us to do?"". I was still concerned for the other people that I work with. A coworker of mine said that it's happened to her samples before as well. But of course, I had to read the MSDS and became really anxious and worried.

2. In wave mechanics, nodes are the place where the ""wave"" crosses an axis (where the value corresponding is zero) in the graph. Same happens when we find probability density, where troughs convert into crests BUT there are several points at which densities are zero. *I CONFESS I KNOW VERY LITTLE ABOUT WAVE MECHANICS*

3. Let's assume that nodes have zero probability of finding electron/s. Again, let's consider a situation: An electron of hydrogen atom is excited and shifted from 1s to 2s orbital. Since 2s has a radial node of (say) some width, in order for an electron to go to 2s from 1s, the electron HAS to pass through the node. If we find probability of finding an electron at this particular instant, it SHOULD NOT be zero as 1s is enclosed in a nodal shell.

4. I MAY have confused ""Probability of finding electron"" with ""Probability density"". I'm yet to understand difference between the two.

3508,hbgu40,"A masterclass in how to entirely miss the point, and end up clearly illustrating the exact thing you're arguing against:- Greg Ashman's objections to ""Decolonising maths and science degrees at Oxford"" [(kinda) Meta]","^(This post is not about chemistry so much as science more generally, but being a chemist... I ended up here; and think it probably brings up topics which are worth considering in the context of our field specifically.)

&amp;#x200B;

Google pointed me at a short blog article this morning: ["" Decolonising maths and science degrees at Oxford""](https://gregashman.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/decolonising-maths-and-science-degrees-at-oxford/) which was a reaction to [an article in the Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/black-lives-matter-oxford-will-decolonise-degrees-c7dkhbtnd) regarding a statement from the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford.

I thought it gave an accurate description of how UK science and mathematics degrees are structured... ***that's the limit of the praise I can give it though.***

&amp;#x200B;

The author seems to have focused on their own biases against the humanities, perhaps fostered by the imprecise language that the VC had used (decolonise can and does mean vastly different things to different people); which gives it a rather divisive if not condescending tone...

More importantly for me he totally missed the point that:

* There are well documented issues with Ethnicity and STEM\*, as highlighted by incidents like that diatribe in [Angewandte Chemie](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/gx6a5w/something_is_seriously_wrong_over_at_angewandte/) the other week which expose the issues and attitudes festering beneath the surface.
* That's something we as a community can't just ignore, partially because it will result in us losing out on lots of potentially excellent scientists from Ethnic Minority backgrounds joining us to do great science, but mainly because we become morally complicit in the actions and inactions which cause discrimination and under-representation if we do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I did however find it ironic that his argument boils down to ""science degrees are divorced from the context of doing science in the real world, and don't teach the impacts that social structures have on science or that science has on the wider community; so there's no need to change them"", which actually illustrates why ensuring that potential scientists are educated with an understanding of the context in which their field exists, and their work is done, is important. 

Because if the author had that understanding, he'd have got that ""decolonisation"" means much more than changing curriculum materials, and that there are things the scientific and academic community can and should be doing to attract students, academics, and professionals from ethnic minority backgrounds and support them in reaching their full potential.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I have **no idea** how to fix these problems, *but I'm 100% certain that denying we need to fix them won't be an effective solution.*

I recently obtained a chunk of limestone that has quartz crystals growing off of it, but those crystals are entombed in calcite crystals. If I use diluted HCl to dissolve the calcite do I need to worry about the possibility of the solution of water boiling due to heat released by the reaction?  
I read online that the reaction should produce only water and carbon dioxide, which are safe. I plan to neutralize any excess acid after the reaction is complete by either adding more calcite crystals to the acid, or by slowly adding a (very) diluted solution of baking-soda in water.  
Are there any things I should know about before doing this? I plan to wear gloves and safety glasses, and to do the reaction in a ceramic mug on my back porch.

So, despite cleaning it out often, my cat's box always REEKS of ammonia unless I replace all the litter. Doesn't matter how well or how often I clean it, the smell never seems to go away. 


My first thought was to toss baking soda into it on the off chance it would reduce the odor by forming ammonium sodium carbonate with ammonia gas. That did not work. My next thought is some sort of stronger acid/base reaction with a solid acid that won't harm the cat. Boric acid is pretty mild, mild enough to be used in eye drops and doesn't absorb much through the skin, but is toxic when ingested. However, it will neutralize ammonia incredibly well (as a Lewis acid, not just a Brønsted one). My only concern is, would the contact the cat would have with the litter be enough to be toxic? I'd think just with his paws wouldn't affect him, but I don't want to take a risk.


Does anyone have any other ideas for relatively nontoxic solid acids I can use? Maybe stearic acid finely ground? I can reacidify all natural soap, obviously anything with SLS or other sulfonate soaps are out of the question, but good old fashioned lye-and-lard soap. Remove the glycerin, dissolve remaining sodium stearate/alkanoate in water, reacidify with HCl, stearic acid should fall out of solution. Mix liberally with litter, it should form ammonium stearate on reaction with the ammonia gas. Totally harmless to the cat. 


I don't want to spray vinegar or phosphoric acid around his box, sure that would neutralize well but it would smell bad and discourage him from using it.


I can't seem to find a litter that handles the smell, and I can't exactly afford to give him a brand new pan of litter every day. I already clean it every day or every other day, and even fresh after cleaning it smells.  Any other ideas on non-toxic odor removal?",13,2020-06-17 19:21:43,chemistry

Well, I couldn't find the brush today and so opted to use an old scrubby dish sponge. I had been using this sponge for a while, so it was time to retire it.  


Unfortunately, I didn't think to rinse it thoroughly first, so there may have been residual dish soap inside. I have already rinsed down the bath tub walls etc. with some hot water, but I also sprayed some of the diluted bleach mixture onto the sponge directly in order to wipe down the sink. I did spray some clean cold water onto the sink to rinse it a bit and then let it dry.  


But now, I'm a bit worried that I may have created toxic gases. The bathroom does have a humidity fan, but it doesn't turn on unless it senses 60% humidity. At this point I have placed a Molekule air purifier in the bathroom with the doors closed, hoping that it pushing the air out the vent even without the fan running.  


Should I be worried? How long until it would be safe to go back in? Am I overreacting? I have a headache slightly and am a bit dizzy, but this happens any time I use bleach in there by itself. Sink seems to be dry already, just a bit of water left in the tub area.

Or will both bonds experience lengthening where the blue bond just experience a greater lengthening effect than the pink bond? Then if you had to arrange the pink, blue and green bond lengths in increasing order where would the green bond length fit in? Will the P-Rh bonds in the tetrahedral complex be longer than both the blue and pink bonds due to the much smaller splitting of the tetrahedral complex compared to the square planar complex? would aspects like backbonding and spin have an effect on the bond lengths? This is a purely hypothetical question with hypothetical complexes. Both complexes are assumed to be diamagnetic.

3570,har7bo,Lowest emission spectrum possible?,"Hello everyone, 

I've googled this a couple times, and for some reason I'm not getting a suitable answer to this question. By emission, I mean emission of a certain frequency by excitation with another. I read that certain spin interactions/changes(forgive me for not being particularly knowledgeable on this subject) can emit lower-energy radio bands. But aside from this, it seems like infared is the predominate frequency of the lowest energy emitted in most materials. 

In case your wondering what the application of this question is, it relates to power generation. It seems like if such a material existed that emitted ELF radio waves that it would be exploited for this purpose, given that ELF can be directly converted to electrical power by electromagnetic induction. So, in the case of a nuclear reactor, suppose we have material A, that absorbs gamma rays and emits ultraviolet. Then, this ultraviolet hits material B. Material B absorbs the radiation, and simultaneously emits infared. Finally, material C absorbs infared and emits\[ideally\] ELF radio waves, or even just microwaves. Now the argument might arise that the energy output of such a system is less efficient.

First and foremost, the system of a fission reactor is not particularly efficient to begin with. There is tremendous heat loss through friction of the generator and conduction away from the reactor itself.

Secondly, even though higher energy radiation becomes lower energy radiation, I assume that there is more of the lower energy radiation(that is, more waves) then there would be absorbed high energy radiation. 

Because of this, it leads me to assume that the output of such an absorption-emission would be extremely low voltage and high current. Of course, the dynamics of the output could be optimized through the use of several transformer stages, and then the power would be more usable for long-distance applications.

&amp;#x200B;

So, overall, the question that I'm asking is are there any materials that have radio waves in their emission spectrum? And I'm talking about emission by absorption of a higher frequency.

Sorry if this is a little out of the topic of chemistry, I figured that it was something most people versed in the field know about and both relate to materials science.

I've been working on making some permittivity measurements for a system of alumina particles dispersed in an oil.  What I was hoping to do is to measure the permittivity of the neat oil well over a range of frequencies (using impedance analyzer and measured impedance/phase angle) so that I can measure the permittivity of the alumina particles by measuring the paste with a known volume fraction.

I'm totally new to these types of measurements and found some hits on researchgate that explain the calculations but i'm a little confused by some results.  The one that has me stumped currently is that the measured permittivity is a function of the gap size.  As a reduce the gap the calculated permittivity is going down quite linearly.  Given that the sample thickness is used to calculate the permittivity this should be independent.  I'm wondering if maybe this is an indication that the electrode setup is not fully filled?

Now my question is, does the same principle go for the s-shell? Is a half filled s-shell also more stable or at least as stable a filled s-shell?And, for that matter, is it more stable to have an empty s-shell and a filled d-Shell, for example in Copper, to have \[Ar\]4s^(0)3d^(10)?

I'll start with (some of these might be obvious to you):

 \[Organic chemistry\] 

[http://chem.chem.rochester.edu/\~nvd/](http://chem.chem.rochester.edu/~nvd/) \- not voodoo chemistry, useful website for practical organic chemistry, has tips on how to manipulate reactants, do's and don'ts, chromatography tips, etc.

\[Scouting literature\]

[webofknowledge.com](https://webofknowledge.com) \- combines databases from multiple search engines, including PubMed and others, I use this for performing literature reviews along with Google Scholar and Science direct

\[Planning synthesis\]

 [https://www.reaxys.com/](https://www.reaxys.com/) \- I use this to search for a specific synthetic pathway for a given transformation, can search by structure, CAS names, etc.

 [https://scifinder.cas.org/](https://scifinder.cas.org/)  \- this is another search engine I use when planning synthesis, I always search by structure

\[Learning analytical chemistry\]

3646,h9ywih,pH paper comes out white after bleach and vinegar solution, I was messing around with my universal pH paper and tested vinegar (pH 3.5)  and bleach (9.5). I tested both of these liquids using the paper and both times the color was clear and I was able to determine the pH. I wanted to mix the two in equal parts by volume to see if it would neutralize (out side duh). After I mixed the two liquids and the reaction settled I took a measurement again but the color squares on the paper turned white. Like pure white. The paper was able to measure concentrated bleach and vinegar on their own. Why when I mix the two did my litmus paper fail? Google says HOCI acid is formed. But I don't think that had anything to do with it. If it matters the solution was at room temperature when I took all readings. Thanks in advance.,7,2020-06-16 02:16:45,chemistry

Shouldn't it be 347 kJ/bond? Even in my textbook it gave me the following formula:

ΔH =  ΣnD(bonds broken) - ΣnD(bonds formed)

So just to point out the obvious, ΔH represents change in enthalpy and Σ means ""sum of"". In addition D represents the ""bond energy"" measured in kJ/mol.

The thing that confuses me is this...

In most equations I have seen thus far, the variable ""n"" normally refers to the number of moles (obviously measured in moles). But for the equation posted above, it is supposed to mean NUMBER OF BONDS... ALSO MEASURED IN MOLES.

How is your quantity of bonds supposed to be measured in moles? Yes, this equation works and gets you the right answer when used correctly... But how does it make sense?

&amp;#x200B;

Why does my textbook measure the number of bonds in terms of moles? How does this make sense? Or does it even make sense? Thanks!",16,2020-06-15 23:18:09,chemistry

3729,h8zqv2,Comparing first-order Rh-P coupling constants,"The Question:

Consider the complex Rh(H2O)(PMe3)3 and assume that it can exist in either the square planar (SP) or tetrahedral (TH) geometry. In the TH geometry, assume all Rh-P bond distances to be identical in solution.

Consider the rough ^(31)P NMR spectra for each of the geometries and determine the relative magnitude of the first-order coupling constants present in each spectrum. Use Fermi contact interaction to explain your answer. 

My progress:

I have determined that the ^(31)P NMR spectrum for the TH complex will consist of a doublet. The ^(31)P NMR spectrum for the SP complex will consist of a doublet of triplets and a doublet of doublets. Due to the strong trans influence of the PMe3 ligands the two equivalent PMe3 groups of the SP complex will have a larger Rh-P bond distance than the PMe3 ligand trans to the H2O ligand (which has a small trans influence). Therefore the dd will have a smaller ^(1)J value than the dt. 

My problem is that I don't know how to factor in the TH complex. How would the Rh-P bond distance in the TH complex compare to the Rh-P bond distance in the SP complex? I assume that if I have the bond distances I can get the ^(1)J values and then I'll be able to arrange the peaks according to their ^(1)J values (almost like superimposing the two ^(31)P NMR spectra of the two complexes).

\-Presentation of an important chemical reaction

\-Where does it appear in nature, or where is it used for

\-What is the history of it's discovery and use

I tried finding articles comparing the two, but I can’t really seem to find anything. Obviously they’re different types of matter, but what I want to know is what makes them different. I assume they have similar construction because they share similar names, except for “Per”. Could someone explain what the similarities (or opposites) are?

3860,h7d3ne,"Looking to enter the work force again (PhD in organic), but unsure what direction to take as I have restrictions. What would be the best areas to look for? My situation is a little difficult, but not impossible.","I am in need of some advice on what to do next with my career, and specifically what direction I should go in. I’m rather lost for several reasons. I’m considering teaching, or writing/editing, and if needed a labwork job. As for some background about myself: 

+ PhD in total synthesis, graduated 3 years ago.

+ No publications due to bad luck with my projects, and a toxic adviser relationship.

+ 2 years of experience working in a non-lab market research position.

I quit my job late last summer due to long term extreme burnout, very poor mental health, and it began to manifest as physical health problems. I also hated market research, and want nothing to do with marketing/sales. I’ve half way recovered, and that’s kind of plateaued at this point. I think I am well enough to start working again, but it’s more I objectively need to. I’m fortunate that I have excellent references from my last job, as I would never ask my graduate PI for one.

This paragraph is needed to get this off my chest (I am sorry if I sound like I am whining): If I am totally honest with myself, I don’t want to work in chemistry or science anymore. I’ve been beat up by my experience so much and the wound won’t close, but I sadly do not have a choice. I have 130k of student loans (all from undergrad), and in order to just float in life, I need to make at least 80k a year. Working 40h a week is *barely* doable for me, so doing extra jobs or long hours isn’t possible either. If it weren’t for my loans I would be doing something totally different that paid less. The implication: I am *not* motivated or really interested in almost every job I look at, because I honestly don’t want to do it. I’m worried people will notice in interviews as well. It’s a fine line to balance because if it’s like my last job I’ll just burn out again and suffer more health problems. I still have days here and there where dying seems more appealing because of my life situation, an I have sort of accepted I’m always going to feel like this (I have received extensive therapy over the years).

With that out of the way, if I clear my head some, there are several options that I have. The first is science writing and editing. At my last job, writing and editing was one of the aspects of the job that I liked the most (though what I enjoyed the most was doing customer service duties). Writing, public speaking, and communication in general is super easy for me and not draining. I’m extremely skilled at explaining complex topics to any audience level. When I look at writing jobs though, they seem few and far between, or are associated with patents/law or involve doing research as well which would burn me out fast. I’m actually more sort of stumped on how to find the right sort of job openings for this. 

The second is teaching. I love teaching! Won awards for it and it’s one of my natural skills. There is a problem though: pay. They salary isn’t high enough in the vast majority of cases. An ideal job would be one where I teach many ochem courses, advise students, write, and work with other faculty. I do NOT want to do any research at all. Only teach. The openings that do appear to pay enough are for positions where you’re expected to start a research group/program which I absolutely could not do, it would burn me out extremely fast. 

The last is some sort of lab position. I’ll be honest… I really don’t want to go back into lab. My lab experience in grad school was a nightmare, and I am average at it at best. One exception would be is if the labwork wasn’t about creating new methods, and more about doing short synthetic routes using established methods and little needing to rigorously follow the current literature. It’s pretty much impossible for me to sustain following the currant literature as research is so stressful and hard for me. The only reason I am considering this is it would likely pay enough for me to live, and there might be spots where they won’t drain the lifeforce out of me. 

All of this is to say, is I have done a lot of soul search on what to do for a job. I’m very skilled, but kinda of damaged goods, and all of the soul searching has told me I should leave entirely. Sadly, that isn’t an option. As such, I need to find a career that pays enough, and would cause the lowest amount of stress possible so I don’t burn out again.

If you have any advice, or directions you could point me in on what I could do that pays enough (80k), or what to completely avoid, I would appreciate it. Thank you!",9,2020-06-11 22:26:21,chemistry

Little question to PhDs here. I am currently in my first year PhD and I’m pretty anxious about my future. I am studying metal complexes that target cancer cells (lab in France btw). I hope to work in academia later, meaning I am aware I’ll have to do some postdocs. I chose my subject knowing it would be pretty wide and would teach me a lot of differents things (methods I mean) from organic synthesis to cell culture, with physico-chemical questions. But I’m afraid to be trapped in medicinal chemistry for life. 
So here’s my question : after my PhD, is it possible to do more fundamental researches and with different techniques than the ones I am currently using (postdocs) ? I developed an interest in biochemistry this year but every biochemistry postdoc offers I’ve seen so far ask for candidates able to do protein expression for example or others biomol techniques I only know in theory. I wish I could learn new things during postdocs, maybe more biochem/fundamental oriented but I only see offers but I feel recruiters want candidates who are really close to the subject’s team. Entering biochemistry lab with a medicinal chemistry curriculum seems impossible whereas I think it would be of interest to have experience in both, am I wrong ?
In fact, I thought postdocs were meant to widen my knowledges but it seems recruiters would want me to do things I already learnt during PhD...

I am currently doing an internship at a marine research lab as a chemist and have been tasked to find a suitable alternative to stain the macrozoobenthos samples with. They are currently using Rose bengal in a formalin solution (I believe 20% seawater with perhaps a little sodiumborate). This causes all samples to colour bright pink/red-ish. Sometimes the samples will not have colour at all making sorting them out kind of a pain. This is most common in samples with lots of sediment and clay.

I was wondering if anyone could help me find out how this colour comes to be or at least push me in the right direction of finding out. According to most literature I've read Rose bengal is pretty much always used for staining these sort of samples and I aim to find out why and see if there is indeed a better alternative.

I'm doing a synthesis with selenium, starting with dimethyl diselenide.  It's gross.  I am aware that procedure for waste disposal is to reduce the selenium and eventually get elemental selenium, and I plan to do this, but I would also like to ask for tips/tricks that will help me to avoid annoying other lab residents and my lungs.  

Currently, I am having a lot of difficulty cleaning glassware and my workspace while generating minimal selenium waste (which I isolate for separate disposal).  Don't worry -- everything is cleaned, there are respirators, yadda yadda.  Instead, I generate a lot of selenium waste just because I don't know how to get the smell off the darned glassware or other surfaces without using tons of liquid.

A friend and I recently started a seminar series on Twitch, which we call [ThinksWithTwitch](https://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch). It's a quarantine-friendly version of an in-person series my friend used to do at her place. Each Thursday night we bring on one of our friends to give a short talk about their research in some area of STEM followed by a Q&amp;A. This week we have a topic that I think might be of interest to people in this subreddit. If you're interested we'd love it if you'd come by during the stream and ask questions!

Speaker: Bharath Ramsundar

Title: Open Sourcing Medicine Discovery

Where: [twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch](http://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch)

When: Thursday 6/11, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: Discovering new medicine has traditionally required the use of proprietary methods and software. This reliance on proprietary techniques stops companies and academics from easily sharing know-how between projects, slows down the discovery of new medicine and raises costs. The DeepChem project aims to build an open source foundation for medicine discovery by creating a high quality suite of software and protocols that can enable scientists and engineers to work together to find better medicine faster.

Polyurethane sheet turns yellow over time due to Oxidation under UV and/or BHT-NOx reaction.

My concern here is regarding the latter. As per my understanding if the anti Oxidant -  Butylated hydroxytoluene  is present in the material and it reacts with Nitrogen oxide it the atmosphere it can cause this.

I wanted to know about the threshold for the qty of BHT in parts per million for this to happen and whether the general NOx content in the atmosphere is sufficient.

Any sort of advice or knowledge on the matter is much appreciated.

**Purpose-**

This material was used in the manufacture of some textile items which were later found to turn yellow at the folding mark.

Lab tests revealed the presence of 2.61 ppm of BHT in the polyurethane sheet.

Wanted to find out if this is majorly contributing to this or whether it was mostly due to oxidation.

4004,gzzi87,Tips on Sonication of viscous oil/resin &amp; water,"I have a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator (FB 505) and I'm trying to suspend a viscous plant material oil/resin into water. The hope is to be able to get a good amount of this oil/resin into small quantities of water (eg: 1g oil in 2oz water). I have done a bunch of trials with the sonicator amplitude all the way up to 95% power, but each time, the resin continues to separate.  I have tried adding the resin to a carrier MCT oil (1/2oz) in 150 degree bath (which suspends much of it) then sonicating this mix with the 2oz water, but the combo then separates down the center. I've also tried adding two emulisifying agents (Xantham Gum &amp; Acacia Fiber) to this mix to suspend the oil mix (plant &amp; MCT). Same separation.

I haven't played much with the sonicator at low amplitudes, because my logic says that higher would mix stronger, but I'm open to reflections/ideas here.

Any advice on temperature of water, volume of water to resin etc?  Anything you know about Sonication of oils would be helpful actually! Any advice on how to use this device correctly would be greatly appreciated!

I had easy success mixing cannabis resin and water, but this particular CO2 extract plant matter is even stickier and tricky.

NH3 + H2O -} NH4 + OH

How do you know that its NH4 + OH and not NH + OH3? or NH5 + O? Or NH + H + H2 + OH? Or just NH5O? Or as a better question, why the NH4 + OH are the final products? Is there any methodical way of determining the products of a reaction?

Another example; 

CO3 + H2O -} HCO3 + OH

Again, why just HCO3 + OH and not something like HC + O4H? Or CO4 + H2? 

Another example;

CH4 + 2O2 -} 2H2O + CO2

Why H2O + CO2 as products and not CH2O + O3H2? Closest answer i got so far was about bond numbers, but this example satisfies bond numbers(pardon me if this is not the correct translation).

4059,gzgmfz,I want to create a council of life-long learners,"This is not super relevant to this subreddit, but I believe that what I'm looking for might pertain to this demographic.  I'm looking for a group of people with vast interests who would like to do research on a specific subject, and frequently meet with the other group members for exchanges on what we have found.  Here is an overview of my vision:

- I would be the organizer, and I would also be one of no more than a dozen people who all look into various different topics from their respective subjects, in preparation for the next meeting.
- At each meeting, we would all have a chance to present our findings, with a question period after each presentation.

I'm hoping that there are some out there with enough passion for knowledge who would join me in creating this council.  Further details of operations can be created in a collaboration with those that are interested, if they reach out.  Here is a list of some possible subjects of study, depending on the interests of group members found:

Mathematics
Physics
Chemistry
Biology
Psychology
Philosophy
Technology
History
Geopolitics
Arts
Languages

And open to other suggestions if you have one!  But I insist it only be 1 person per subject, although I propose they can be traded in a scenario where 1 member approves another member to do a guest presentation on their subject.

In the 1990s there was an outbreak of giardia in the state of São Paulo, Brazil, caused by contaminated lettuce and/or other produce.   Local health authorities recommended disinfecting such vegetables by soaking them in water with small amounts of bleach or potassium permanganate (KMnO₄).  Local drugstores then sold small dropper bottles of bleach or permanganate solution, as well as these permanganate pills.

I found some of those pills at home, a couple of years ago.  They were still in their metal-plastic blister cards (of the type commonly used for medicine pills).  Maybe I should have kept them in that packaging, for the historic value.  Unfortunately I did not think of that, and transferred them to that vial.  I just found the vial again in my workshop.

The pills do seem to be mostly KMnO₄, but perhaps with a small amount of some binder.  Each pill was supposed to be dissolved in a large quantity of tap water. I forgot how much, but probably between 1 and 5 liters.

I have a 3 acres agricultural land with acidic  (pH 5-5.5) soil, where I grow veggies (organic). 

Usually I use dolomite to raise pH to 6.5. This time one of the sales guys insisted that I use their calcium carbonate product, instead of dolomite. He added that their product does have magnesium (added) in adequate quantities.  He says, CaCo3 + magnesium is better to maintain the pH to 7 because as soon as the pH goes below 7, CaCo3 gets into action and keep the pH back to 7 and maintain that level for a long time.

Do you think I should go ahead with this (CaCo3 + magnesium) for the purpose?",8,2020-06-07 10:12:23,chemistry

4167,gyc5wf,[2020/06/07] Synthetic Challenge #134,"**Intro**

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 134 of Synthetic Challenge!! 

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

4168,gyb5jv,Any Chemist who would be willing to explain in the simplified way overall / component mass balance during adsorption.,"I have search through hundred of articles, literally and many books starting from ***Ruthven*** *- Principles of Adsorption and Adsorption Processes*, because many refers to him and it is considered to be a ""mantra"" of separation processes/modelling. They also refer to some other authors for specific parts of describing adsorption such as ***Glueckauf*** for LDF modelling which I understood. 

My biggest problem is that **ALL** of these books (*Ruthven*, etc.) and articles just write ""automatically"" almost the same equation (in slightly different forms - some add density of bed, some add correction 1/L, etc. (not explaining why)):

&amp;#x200B;

[Component mass balance](https://preview.redd.it/ooy96r5q9h351.png?width=1032&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=db66dd8cc3f25585b93e3aecf456b0fb4791544e)

&amp;#x200B;

and describe it in just a several lines of text saying what are the parameters and that is it - no explanation how to use such equation, how to solve it with given boundary/initial conditions and what is the desirable output (what can be expressed by empirical equations / what is variable) - is it concentration on time development? what depends on what and how to correctly describe the moving gas phase (dispersion, velocity \* concentration dependance on axial axis, etc.). Does component balance represents every substance from the mixture or just those who adsorbed? etc. I just cannot find these answers anywhere.

I would be very grateful if someone can shine some light on that and help me understand it in a simplified way.

Are there any other acids than sulfuric that could be suitable for this synthesis?

This is mostly because it would be interesting as I could get my hands on conc. sulfuric if I wanted (though it would be difficult), and I could use another method (using sodium bisulfate instead of sulfuric acid and melting the two reagents).",6,2020-06-07 03:12:59,chemistry

I am interested in investing in lithium hydroxide production as its use in the electric vehicle and battery industry is set to increase about 20 fold in the next decade. However lithium carbonate is set to increase relatively very modestly. So I want to ensure my exposure to lithium hydroxide.

Is lithium mined in these compounds to your knowledge or are they produced from raw lithium following mining? 

How hard is it to produce lithium hydroxide?

Can you convert lithium carbonate into lithium hydroxide easily and cheaply?

So I was with my girlfriend watching a movie, and then suddenly we started coughing. 

There was no smell, but this sensation in the throat, like some funny substance was in the air.

We are on the 1st floor. We decide to leave the apartment and let the windows open.

In the stairs this sensation was even worse, and it made us cough, closing our throats.

Outside there was this neighbor from the 6th floor, that felt the same thing on the stair (from the 3rd floor to the base).

So we weren’t crazy. We called the firefighters, and they felt this strange thing (but their machines didn’t detect a single thing); they didn’t know the reason. Their advice was to leave the windows in the stairs open, just in case.

What is this thing? It has no smell at all. It just closes your throat and gives you a cough. I have this feeling that is some sort of chemical gas or something.

On the 0 floor, there is this manicure shop. In the quarantine they were close and I didn’t feel this “gas”. They reopened and this started again. This shop doesn’t have physical access to the stairs.

Is this an unhealthy thing? Am I getting crazy? Does somebody know something about this? Could it be related to this manicure shop?

4240,gxizg2,Gas trap?,"Hi! I have what I'm sure is a very odd question. I've recently been moved to a different department at work, so I now work in the chemical testing lab of a large chemical recycling plant. I have no background in chemistry. Ive come across some paperwork referencing a ""gas trap"". I've asked a few people I thought would know what that is, but nobody has. The first 3 lines read:
Dissolve 1 gram of iron oxide in 100ml sulfuric acid solution in a 250ml Erlenmeyer flask
Add 2ml of sodium bicarbonate solution (50g sodium bicarbonate to 1 liter distilled water)
Close with a gas trap filled with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. 

Any light you could shed would be very helpful! I'm eager to jump in, but our lab doesn't have all the equipment we need. I've tried to find anything referencing a gas trap, but have been unable. I'm hoping the terminology has changed, as this paper was written in 1990 or so.

Now the 1st step is obviously the deprotonation of the alpha-hydrogen on the malonitrile, but the only mechanism I have been able to find shows water acting as the base to remove the hydrogen. 

Water has a pKa \~14 and H30 is \~0 but how can the product be a stronger acid than the starting acid? Similarly, the pKa for an activated methylene hydrogen is \~11 and though I can't find  a figure for the alkoxide it will undoubtedly be extremely high, so we also have the product being a stronger base than the starting base.

CN-CH2-CN + H20 &lt;-&gt; CN-CH-CN + H30

I feel like I am missing something fundamental here but I thought  that the equilibrium  would favour the weaker acid/base being produced, but I just can't that squares with the pKa values?

Also  [http://ccd.chemnetbase.com/](http://ccd.chemnetbase.com/) for searching chemicals (I don't use that very much, but If you do not have access to scifinder or reaxys, there is a way around)

\-  [https://chemsearch.kovsky.net/](https://chemsearch.kovsky.net/)  Life and time save when checking references from articles.

4327,gwlnqs,Any idea what could be causing massive VOC spikes in my apartment?,"I recently purchased an air quality meter to measure indoor CO2 and PM2.5, and it also happens to measure PM10, HCHO, and VOCs. The typical background level of VOCs in my apartment is around 0.1-0.2 mg per cubic meter, but once in awhile it spikes to between 6-7 mg per cubic meter. The safe limit is supposedly 0.5mg per cubic meter so this is very concerning to me as I have a two-year-old at home.  
  
I doubt these are faulty readings because the number takes a solid hour to very gradually return to normal levels each time. Also, everything else generally remains within normal limits during these spikes, though sometimes HCHO spikes simultaneously as well. The meter is located in the kitchen, but it's often happened when no cooking is going on. The one constant is these spikes have consistently occurred between 7am and 4pm, while the gigantic apartment complex 100 feet away is being constructed. I obviously suspect the construction site is somehow giving off plumes of this stuff, but is this even possible? And how dangerous is this, exactly?

I'm not much of a chemist myself, but my understanding is that the added methyl group makes methamphetamine much more potent than other amphetamines. I'm not sure why this would be the case, though - my guess is that the methyl group makes it more soluble in the liver, or perhaps changes the way it's broken down?

4368,gw17ht,Count number of water bridges,"Hi all! I am trying to find the number of water bridges between nucleotides and amino acids in a protein. I also need to classify these water bridges according to [this paper of Li et al. (2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21612274/). They proposed 3 categories of water bridges, but I am mainly interested in the first two: single-water bridge (SWB)  -  a water molecule forming hydrogen bonds with a nucleotide and an amino acid, e.g. C - HOH - Glu, and double-water bridge (DWB) - there are 2 waters between a nucleotide and an amino acid, e.g. C - HOH - HOH - Glu.

I ran HBPLUS and obtained the output file. I then wrote some code to process the output file and obtained some relations like [SWB example](https://imgur.com/zIm8UeH) and [DWB example](https://imgur.com/x0eRTbt) (an made-up example base on the SWB example). The arrows go from donors to acceptors, e.g. A1020 -&gt; A0219 means A1020 is the donor, and A0219 is the acceptor. Some of my concerns are

1. I don't think the arrows are relevant here, because we just want to know if there is a way to connect a nucleotide and an amino acid through a water (HOH). Is that correct?
2. For the SWB example, if my guess above was correct, I believe there are 6 water bridges. Do you think it is correct? The one thing that bothers me is that A1020 donates 2 hydrogen bonds to B0674. I don't know if they are duplicate or they are supposed to be what they are.
3. For the DWB example, I encountered a lot of situations where there are 2 hydrogen bonds between 2 waters, so I don't know if I am supposed to time 2, so I have 12 double-water bridges?

I have experience with pyrophorics and all manipulations of the white phosphorus would be in a glove box or on a Schlenk line. Not a bomb making question, illegal activity, etc. The usual vendors (Alfa, Sigma-Aldrich, etc.) don't sell white phosphorus, or if they do, I can't find it in their web stores.

Is there a good literature reference, standard operating procedure, etc. on how to sublime white phosphorus from red phosphorus? Normal Google gets me stuff from sites like sciencemadness, which while great isn't something suited for a research laboratory. I can't find it on Google Scholar; looking at papers that use white phosphorus as a reagent hasn't led me to a synthesis. 

Any suggestions on references? I'm hoping I can do it completely in the solid-state with vapor transport in a sealed tube rather than do it in solution.

From columns running dry, to uneven loading, to spilling fractions, I've pretty much never had a separation go smoothly. I've been able to get by thus far by using internal standards and GC or NMR yields when optimizing reaction conditions, but I've reached a very synthesis-heavy stage in my PhD project, and there seems to be no way around running a large number of columns in the near future.

I've read just about every online resource available, as well as every practical organic textbook I could find, but everything still co-elutes unless the delta RF is like 0.5 or higher. I think the only way to solve the issue is actual practice. With this in mind, can anyone recommend some good mixtures of common lab chemicals that I could mix and then separate by chromatography. Alternatively, any reactions that I could run and then purify would be great practice. I have a pretty well-stocked lab, so there should be plenty of options.

I am currently in the process of making a ferrofluid. I got the inspiration from the YouTube video by Nile red.  Now I need to convert Ferric chloride into ferrous chloride using some steel wool. Now I did a very small scale test of this reaction in a safe environment to just make sure to account for any possible issues on a larger scale. Now when I did the reaction it released a vapor, that had a pretty noticeable smell. Since I didn't know what this gas was, I decided to neutralizer the reaction using some baking soda. My question is what is the gas being produced. I believe its either water or hydrogen but the smell is what makes me concerned as neither of them smell like that. The gas can also been seen in the video at around 3 minutes.  I cannot find the formula for it online with any gas as a product. Does anyone know?

4495,guqczy,Looking for a water soluble adhesive for 3d printing - not my area!!,"Hello,

I'm hoping you can help me in my journey to more robust 3d prints. I *think* a water soluble adhesive is part of the answer but let me explain the application and thought process.

I run an old zcorp z510 3d printer. It is a rare mode of operation in today's world of squirting plastic. It:

- spreads ~0.1 mm thick layers of powder over the build area
- uses an inkjet printer head (HP10 - c4810a) to selectively fire a binder liquid on to this thin layer
- lowers the print area down 0.1 mm 
- spreads another layer of powder
- repeat the process

This process builds a damp model in a supporting area of dry powder.

The powder: 66% plaster (drywall repair stuff, gypsum additive), 16.5% maltodextrin (used for wicking the binder I have read), 16.5% icing sugar (I guess this recrystallization would act like a glue?!)

The binder: 55% water, 40% IPA, 5% glycerol (to give it the correct viscosity for the printer head)

I have seen people add up to 10% PVA dust in the powder to give better model strength.

Currently I bake the damp models in a 75 Deg. C. oven then dip in liquid soy wax which strengthens the part immensely but small details are lost in the removal of the model from the build area/removing the unbound powder from the model.

What kind of adhesive would you suggest to add to the binder? Getting the PVA dust in the UK is hard/impossible in the particle size I need without buying hundreds of kilos (not going to happen!!). I wonder if I can solve this issue from the other end.

Your thoughts on the process in general are welcome!

Ethanol 96% 

Hydrogen peroxide 3%  

Glycerol 98%

I created [https://scibase.co](https://scibase.co) a few years ago to help tackle the reproducibility issue in chemistry. Due to some personal issues unrelated to the site, I never got to spend as much time on it as I wanted. I never wanted to take the site down because I always intended to come back to it, but life intervened. It's now been a few years and - because it costs me a reasonable amount of money to run and maintain - I either need to push forward with it, sell it, or shut it down. 

While I spent a lot of time and money developing it and believe there's some really good/useful functionality there, if folks don't find it useful and/or have some specific suggestions on how to quickly and easily make it useful, then I'll probably shut it down.

If any of you are interested, I'd love for you to take a look and give me your honest feedback. *Keep in mind that the site is a bit old now so some of the functionality probably doesn't work correctly any more (for example, the browser plugin).* Keep that in mind when taking a look.

My ultimate goal would be to make it useful enough for people to actually use and contribute to - any ideas to that end are welcome. The ultimate metric I'll be using to decide where to shut it down or not is the number of reviews that are getting posted.

Thanks,

Brendan

Esters are apparently made out of alcohols — which are defined by their -OH group — and acids.

In a very misguided attempt to unclog a bathroom sink, I squirted some Lysol toilet bowl cleaner (12% HCL) down the drain and then added about 1/2 a cup of Calcium Hypochlorite (68%) powder (pool chlorine powder).

My total exposure time to the gases was between 2- 4 minutes, during which time I was running around in a panic running the faucets, opening the bathroom windows etc.

So finally, my question to the forum is:

* What noxious gases have I inhaled and in approximately what quantities? (to recap, I used about 30 ml of 12% HCL followed by about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of Cal-Hypo).

4639,gt8pjl,The Complete Guide of Chemistry questions MCQ," Read the question carefully and avoid jumping to the conclusions you think the question refers to. Fill in the questions you are sure of first. Limit your choices to difficult questions to solve before continuing. Multiple choice questions not only test your ability to remember and reason, but also test your ability to understand correctly. 

**Expect the answers as you read the questions.** 

If you are reading the question, try answering the question before seeing the options provided. If a person is more able to answer essays and briefly answer questions, this strategy is of great help to them. Studies show that about a third of test participants do better only with this strategy. 

**Remove each clearly incorrect answer.** 

There are a few options that are completely inappropriate and should be discontinued as you read. There are always few such answers, and once you delete them, you have fewer choices. You should always narrow your selection unless you get a response at first glance. 

**Highlight (underline) the key part of the question which contains the key to the answer.** 

The question can be long and complex to understand and all information can be relevant. Therefore, we cannot filter them. What to do in this case? You should underline the main part of the question, the most important details. Some may not allow the use of highlighters and in this case you can use a pen or pencil. 

For example, the question states: – As per brain imaging studies, which part of the brain is responsible for primal emotions like hostility and fear? Now the keywords are part of the brain and primal emotions. When you underline and focus on these words, you can recall the answer quickly as compared to reading the whole question again and again. 

**Apply the formula sheet to answer questions.** 

Solving problems in chemistry requires you to grasp the basic formulas. In most cases, the [**Chemistry questions MCQ**](https://www.entrancei.com/chemistry-questions-mcq) formula sheet is provided. However, when a formula sheet is not accepted in the exam room, consider mastering all the relevant formulas before the exam. You can also write the formulas on your booklet once you settle in the exam room for reference. 

**Don’t read too deep into the questions.** 

If you really don't know the answer to a question, it's easy to over-analyze it. You may wonder if it is a trick question or if there is a deeper meaning. Usually the question means exactly what it says, and you should take it at face value. If you're already confused, there's no point in making it even more complicated for yourself.",0,2020-05-30 00:20:56,chemistry

4707,gsdixu,Analysis Paralysis on Choosing Vacuum Controller/Regulator for Distillation,"I purchased a Precision D25 Vaccum Pump to be used with either distillation or filtration. The deal was too good to say no to. I've spend the last few days looking for a gauge/regulator/controller setup. I reached out to a few companies reps for recommendations but I don't need a state of the art digital controller that costs $800. For the most part I won't be  sucking anything but air but I can setup a trap and may expand to an evap in the future.

This is one project among many and I'm starting to get analysis paralysis and have become overwhelmed by how much appears to be available vs how much I probably need.

I'd like to solicit some advice or recommendations that are grounded on price and simplicity sacrificing accuracy but not safety. Does this make sense?

I'm at the point where what I would love is a ""here buy this"" or ""buy these and assemble"" ""I've used this"" or ""I've seen this having been used with success"". Does this make sense?

Also, I saw in another subreddit about a gem with uranium in it which makes it glow and stuff. So, I was wondering, is the person who owns the gem aware of the safety precautions as in, is there a ""safe-dose"" that people can live with uranium or they just have a deathwish?

He has made the point that he would not be happy to wear a mask due to the risk of adverse effects when working with volatile organic solvents. His argument is as follows: as these masks are not fitted to the face, the volatile gas may diffuse or otherwise travel into the space between the mouth/nose and the inside of the mask and be ""trapped"" there, effectively creating a higher concentration of the volatile solvent. Additionally, when these fumes are breathed out, there may be a recycling effect within the mask as the exhalant contains this volatile solvent and is breathed in again. A further issue highlighted by my partner was the possibility of particulates of solid base material becoming trapped in the damp inside material of the mask when inhaled, thereby creating the effect of a ""base-soaked rag being held to the face"". 

I am a supporter of the use of surgical masks in the laboratory if it means getting back to work and I personally can't see the logic behind any of the above statements based on my own knowledge of solvent vapour behaviour and breathing in surgical masks. However, he has a few years on me and I'm curious as to whether these points resonate with anyone else. Are any of you currently working in labs with surgical masks available?

I have been looking up on how to extract proteins from beans, and the optimal conditions state that to extract mung bean protein, you will need to raise the pH to 8.97, and to settle the proteins you will need a pH of 4.4.

One source I read told me that 2.5g of sodium bicarbonate is sufficient to raise the pH of 1L of water to 8.5-9 (at a temperature of 31.7C) , however in my calculations, it seems like a 0.03moldm-3 solution of sodium bicarbonate will raise the pH to 11+, am I correct in this thinking? I am not sure about the blended mung beans pH.

How much sodium bicarbonate per litre should I add to my pH 7.5 tap water to get it to a pH of 9?

The next step says to add 22.18mL of white vinegar per litre, which I understand means 5% acetic acid, equating to a 0.83moldm-3 solution. Is this enough to reduce the pH of the solution to the requested 4.4?

Why in the world does men’s Cologne always smell better than woman’s Perfume? 
I have an obsession with perfume lately and my favourite is Chanel Coco madamouselle and Coco Chance. These are both eau de parfum. 
However whenever my partner sprays himself with cologne - no matter the brand- he campletely over-rides me!!! You can’t even smell mine unless your extremely close.

Also why does it tend to last longer? It’s stronger and lasts longer. Whenever I read up on it, resources I have read so far say that cologne is less strong than eau de parfum, but to me that’s not true lol!!!

It obviously has something to do with the “Silage” which I think means how it lingers in the air around you.

The below study seems to be the primary source for the claim ""cooking beans/lentils etc. at 10 minutes removes most lectins"" but that's based on a sea-level boiling temperature.

https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1385/0-89603-396-1:505

this may be as much a maths question as a chemistry one, but can it be accurately reckoned how much time it would take to break down lectins at high altitudes with low boiling temps? 203, for instance, for Denver.

First, based on figure one, does lectin (I know this is descriptor of a bunch of different molecules, but I'm assuming there are no good lectins when it comes to human health) ever break down totally at 80c? is it possible a biologically active amount persists at that temperature even after hours of cooking?

Is the breakdown rate/amount linear in terms of both time and the amount destroyed? because even though I can't figure out the algebra as to how long the cooking time would increase to get lectin levels to zero, I also don't know what influence the chemistry of the heat denaturing process has on the process.

Seriously, there's a market for this sort of device for you CEOs out there.

Anyhow, I already know that non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy is frequently use for quantitation of gas phase CO2. Basically it's single wavelength IR spectroscopy for a characteristic NIR CO2 absorbance feature. For convenience, commercial sensors pick 4.3 microns: [https://www.soselectronic.com/articles/sensirion/scd30-is-more-than-just-the-ndir-co2-sensor-2152](https://www.soselectronic.com/articles/sensirion/scd30-is-more-than-just-the-ndir-co2-sensor-2152)

But what I notice is that H2O also has an absorbance feature at 1.4 microns on that graph!

True, this feature has interference from alcohols. but if you know that your gas stream only has water in it as an -OH containing species, it seems that you can make a NDIR gas sensor using a 1.45 micron NIR LED and a broadband, high sensitivity IR detector like a photodiode or thermopile, filtered at 1.45 microns.

I had a weekend to do my research about oils &amp; analysis used to see the quality etc... I didn’t know much, but so far I’ve been learning a lot by my 3rd week working there.  I dont have anyone to show me around or explain too me in person what the company expects or wants. I have to call my friend to ask her questions and use my laptop to search some stuff. I feel like I’m slow when running analysis on the oil samples sometimes. I feel like the plant managers think I’m not capable at times when I make mistakes or I’m taking too long to run analysis on samples.

I'm just really curious about this.  I had a friend who lived in this apartment and every time I would go in there, I'd feel off balance. It randomly started one time, but then it was every time I went in there. The sensation was just a feeling of being a little off balance. Not terrible, but highly disorienting. But the weird thing is that it seemed to just be me, and nobody else seemed to have this experience. However, I am a skinny guy so I may be more susceptible to whatever it was if it was a substance. 

The most likely culprits for dizziness don't really make sense to me.

1. Carbon Monoxide. The stove burners were electric and so was the heat and water heater. There was no gas whatsoever in this apartment, and no other burning fuel. 

2. Natural gas. See above. Additionally, I never noticed an unusual odor. 

3. Cleaning products. I never noticed any weird smell, which rules out bleach/chlorine based cleaners, as well as ammonia and many amines. This is kind of open ended so I could be unaware of some kind of interaction

4. Environmental allergen. Although I've never heard of an allergy causing a feeling of off-balance, it would explain both the fact that it only happened at this guy's apartment, and why nobody else ever mentioned it. 

Any other ideas? Which of my guesses seem most likely? Again I'm mostly just curious since this my friend has moved",3,2020-05-25 21:16:59,chemistry

&amp;#x200B;

I am a layman when it comes to chemistry, but I stumbled across this sulfuric acid synthesis and it seems too good to be true. Am I missing something obvious? Does this require a vaccum environment? It reads as if mostly what is required is the heating of the iron sulfate heptahydrate crystals until they:

1) boil off their water content, which is cooled and gathers as a liquid in an adjacent chamber

2) subsequently decompose into iron oxide and SO3 gas

3) SO3 gas forms H2SO4 once it hits the water that was previously distilled into the product 

I am going to lookup the original cited material soon, but wanted an opinion from folks who understood already.

I am hoping it is as simple as it sounds, or at least easier to perform than the electro chemical processes that I see on youtube.

I've asked a lot of people and received a lot of opinions, but I'd rather get a more scientific opinion, since this is all really chemistry at it's core.

Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you all!",14,2020-05-24 10:47:50,chemistry

4967,gpr4ud,Freezing alcoholic shots for reverse spherification,"Hey guys, thought this might be a good place to throw out a question regarding freezing alcohol. I am trying to do a little reverse spherification experiment to make what are essentially alcoholic tide pods because well... Im bored. I am following a recipe online and one of the key steps is freezing the shots in an ice cube tray before they are placed in the heated sodium alginate bath. However I was a little leery of this as I saw some issues with actually getting the booze to freeze. Here is the recipe I followed:
2oz (60ml) rye whiskey
.25oz (7ml) maple syrup
3-4 dashes angostura bitters
1oz (30ml) water
1.8g calcium lactate gluconate (2% of cocktail by weight)

However, as expected, when I checked them this morning they are half frozen slushy blobs that dont hold shape when trying to remove from the tray. In the video though, the guy gets perfectly frozen cubes. Now obviously this could be just a youtube slight of hand with a different mixture going in the actual tray but that seems off as theres enough info about doing this online. My question is, how could I vary my mixture to get it to freeze better? Is this even the right place to ask the question? If not, could you describe the chemistry behind reverse spherification as Im interested in that as well. Would the membrane formed technically be considered a polymer?

how can a molecule have an expanded octet if it doesnt have more than eight electrons in its valence shell? why is it considered an octet-expanding molecule?? and if it is, why would its own electrons (the dative bond) be able to do the expanding? and why differentiate between the dative and the double bond? what abt those two bonds makes it expanding and non-expanding respectively

4992,gpcnbk,Self Study Book for Chemistry 1,"TL;DR - I need a good text/work book to get a complete understanding of a college level Chem 1 for science majors. 

Background: 
I am a college student who is studying vertebrate zoology and my academic plan is heavy on chemistry classes (chem 1, 2, orgo 1, 2). I am ahead in all my science classes except chemistry which is a problem and I am getting to the point where I can’t postpone any longer because I need it for my major classes.

I’ve been postponing it because when I took chemistry 1 in community college, we had a really awful professor. She didn’t let us do the labs ourselves, she would instead make us watch her do it and would often mess up the steps. When we had questions she often didn’t know how to answer them and would tell us to google it, or would give us a wrong answer. And she didn’t even have us get a text book and or mastering chem or wouldn’t give us access to the slides in class. Basically, she didn’t really teach us at all. She would just hand us the tests to memorize and put us in groups to study each class to read and study together (which as you can imagine didn’t work out well).

The tests were exactly the same as the exams. So we all memorized the exams and most of us got As in the class. Which was good for the GPA, but I was freaking out because I knew I was going to need chemistry moving forward so would try to self teach myself chemistry through YouTube videos. My problem I feel like I know a lot of random stuff but I have a really incomplete understanding of chemistry. I was in chem 2 for 1 weeks and dropped it because I knew I would fail because I was struggling with the review week.

I want to spend the summer self studying chemistry to prepare for chem 2 in the fall. Can anyone recommend books that help with that? Something with practice tests and problems?",8,2020-05-23 16:05:15,chemistry

I'm looking at Al2O3 dehydration of alcohols and according to ""dehydration of alcohols on aluminum hydroxide"" H. Knözinger. Alcohol reduction by this method always leads to an E2 removal of beta hydrogens. So I wanted to synthesize an alcohol with no beta hydrogens to see if a reaction still occurs. 

However, my plan is to take neopentane and react it with iodine via free radical substitution to make 1-iodo-2,2-dimethylpropane. At this point in planning I realize that I need a way to add an alcohol to the iodine's location without forming a primary carbocation, which would cause a methide shift ruining my neopentyl structure leaving my best option as an Sn2 reaction with something like NaOH replacing iodine.

5057,gopgmc,99% isopropyl alcohol needs dilution?,"Hey everyone!

I bought some bottles of 99% isopropyl alcohol as it was the only thing I could get.

I stumbled across an article online that raised some questions for me....mainly whether I need to dilute my 99% concentration and with how much water? I'd like to use it to disinfect personal items and possibly my skin before an injection in case I run out of my alcohol wipes. I hope someone here can give me some advice.

Basically the article claims that 99% is less effective than 70% due to the lack of water content. Here's the excerpt: 

""Between the concentrations of 60% and 90%, Isopropyl alcohol is a very effective agent against microbial bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Higher concentrations don’t generate a much more desirable effectiveness against bacteria, fungi and viruses. This is because, there has to be a significant enough presence of water with the Isopropyl alcohol in order to be effective. And this percentage of water needs to be at least more than 10% within the solution. And the mixture of 30% water with 70% Isopropyl alcohol works best. 

The reason water is so important is because it acts as a catalyst and has a major role in denaturing the proteins of cell membranes of vegetative cells. 70% IPA solutions are very effective in breaching the cell wall fully. Also, the presence of water slows down evaporation and increases the surface contact time with the membrane. With 91% IPA, the evaporation is instant and protein coagulates, rendering the effect of the IPA greatly reduced. This means that 91% IPA takes a greater time to act and doesn’t kill as much bacteria as 70% IPA. The latter is also cheaper.""


Here's the entire article [70% vs 99% isopropyl alcohol](https://labproinc.com/blog/chemicals-and-solvents-9/post/the-difference-between-isopropyl-alcohol-ipa-99-and-70-25)

5059,gopapf,Mercuric Chloride Toxicity?,"Let me preface this by saying that I have a bit of a paranoia about chemicals, so maybe this is a stupid question.

Every 3 months, I have to sample monitoring wells at a gas station. I collect multiple 40 ml VOA samples with Mercuric Chloride as the preservative. According to the lab we use, they only add 0.4 ml or in their words ""one big drop"" of HgCl2 to each bottle.  We fill the bottles up to the top (no bubbles) with the groundwater and ship them back to the lab.

Today, when I was taking one of the samples, I dropped the bottle (after I had filled it with water and I assume diluted the preservavtive) and it broke on the pavement. I called my supervisor and was told to clean it up with a broom and dustpan, which I did. I got all of the glass shards I could see. My co-worker, who is not as nervous/cautious as I am picked up a couple of shards with gloves on. I also had nitrile gloves on while doing all of this. We disposed of the glass and continued sampling.

I am still feeling pretty nervous about this situation, so I guess I have three questions:

1. Are we in any danger from trace contamination via inhaling the chemical, walking in the area with our shoes on, or anything else?
2. If the glass punctured my co-workers glove while picking it up, would he be in any danger?
3. Was there anything that needed to be done to the area? It was outside on pavement, and appeared to have evaporated by the time we were done sampling.

This is outside of my area of expertise. Any thoughts you have are appreciated.",9,2020-05-22 13:49:21,chemistry

I am a rising senior and I am going to apply to grad school in the fall (I want to do synthetic organic chemistry) and I’m planning on taking the chemistry GRE. 

However, I looked at the practice exam that ETS has posted online and it looks incredibly difficult. I think I’ll do decently on the organic section after studying, but if I take the exam in the fall, I will not have had inorganic or much quantum, and my analytical is very rusty to say the least. 

Therefore, I’ve recently been incredibly anxious about taking the exam and have very little idea how to begin studying for it. 

Therefore, I was wondering, how much do programs that say taking the chemistry GRE is highly recommended or required actually care about the score you get? I’m somewhat specifically curious about the top 10 or 20 schools, but the question applies to all schools. 

Could a bad score but an otherwise solid background (I have good grades and LORs, research experience in a wet lab, and have worked as a TA for gen chem one and orgo two) tank an application?

If it matters at all, I’m from the US. 

Also, any tips for studying for the exam beyond taking practice tests (especially in regards to quantum and inorganic)?

But afterwards I was looking for a sub on here but couldn´t find one!

The sub is for exchange and discussions about how to deal with conspiracies and other absurd theories, basically denying scientific facts. How to talk to people beliefing such theories and how to help them.  
But also and sadly it is on how far they go in terms of ""arguments"" and violence sometimes and how to defend oneself when you are beeing assaulted!

I hope you like my idea and follow up with my sub :)

I'm reaching out to you for help because I couldn't find any straightforward information on the internet regarding this topic.

My question is: Does CoS (cobalt sulfide) react with concentrated HCl and does it react with concentrated HNO3?

I know that most sulfides when treated with strong acids emit a gas - H2S but I'm not sure what happens in the case of Cobalt Sulfide because it is the first time I'm working with it. Does it give H2S with HCl? Does it give H2S with HNO3? Does it react at all with them?

CoS + 2 HCl (concnetrated)      --&gt; CoCl2 + H2S         ???

CoS + 2 HNO3 (concentrated) --&gt; Co(NO3)2 + H2S   ???

I know that in order to understand whether the reaction would take place or not when it's regarding two compounds with low solubility in water, I should first look at their Ksp and if the first compound is more soluble than the second - the reaction would take place. If the first compound is LESS soluble than the second (which is supposed to form during the reaction), then the reaction would not take place.

But in this case the compounds that are likely to form are respectively CoCl2 (with HCl) and Co(NO3)2 (with HNO3) which are known to be both quite soluble in water so I don't know what to do. Does that theory which I mentioned apply only when both compounds (the reactant and the product) are with low solubility in water?

In addition, I found a reaction on the internet that goes this way:

 3 CoS + 8 HNO3 = 2 NO + 4 H2O + 3 S + 3 Co(NO3)2

Is this possible and correct in any way? And if this is the correct reaction, why is it so and why does it not lead to emition of H2S like a proposed earlier?

I would be really, really thankful if some of you have the right answers to these questions because they have been torturing me for a few days already and I can't seem to find any realiable information.

I'm looking forward to seeing some of your opinions!

It's fair to say, since A levels, my interest in chemistry has depleted so I'm not really willing to go into one of those traditional jobs for graduate chemists (e.g. researching chemistry or working in pharmaceuticals).
However, I'm nowhere near the end of my degree, so there's a chance something may revive my interest.

My university has a very good (atmospheric) chemistry department - I've chosen the atmospheric chemistry module for the next academic year as well. However unsure if this is ""enough"" to be considered for a meteorologist role.

I'm open to suggestions for other jobs that aren't directly linked to chemistry too; meteorology is just an idea. I could swap to maths if I were set on becoming a meteorologist (though this seems like a drastic option and there's no automatic right to swap at my university :/ )

I figured it was worth a shot asking this question here as I've had difficulty locating an answer through google. Basically I am wondering if anyone has any experience washing rust, or any impurity, out of a precipitate. 

I have a precipitate powder that should ideally be white/colorless. However, sometimes when operators make this powder it has a slight yellow hue to it. I have attempted to wash it with dilute HCl, concentrated HCl, acetone, and 20% NaOH, but none of this seems to work. The powder is extremely non-polar so it basically just floats in the aqueous solutions.  We are speculating that there is rust within the precipitate, but if that were the case I would think HCl would immediately strip it out. I am beginning to think the powder itself is yellow (perhaps due to some rarely occurring reaction?). 

Does anyone have any experience turning a slight colored precipitate back to white/colorless. The precipitate is a pretty complex polymer which melts at approximately 170C and does not dissolve in any known solution.",10,2020-05-20 15:49:47,chemistry

5187,gnhzcc,In need of advice,"Hello! I'm a recent graduate with a M.S in Chemistry (and B.S in biology) and feel a little lost in my next step . I would really appreciate advice from anyone who has been in a similar position. This post is stream of consciousness so I apologize ahead of time if it is all over the place. Briefly put, What options did you consider post-M.S? I know for certain that I dont want to peruse my PhD at this time. I'm eager to go get a job but am unsure what industries I can reach into with the experience I have. Most jobs I see require experience in their specific industry which I obviously dont have right now. I love chemistry and believe that i will become invested in any industry I end up in. Here are some of my concerns:

- I want a job where I will continuously be challenged otherwise I worry I will get bored. I dont want to just be a technician doing brainless work because it feels like a waste of my M.S degree since I could have just become a technician with my B.S. Is this avoidable or is this just part of the process that I have to endure to get my foot in the door?

- I'm confident in my chemistry and problem solving skills but upon completion of my resume, it seems ""empty"" and doesnt do justice to my capabilities. I've been told by many graduates who have gone through my program that we have been well prepared for the workforce However, with no experience I cant be certain of this. Is this just me overthinking?

-What job positions are most rewarding? Based on my knowledge and research, I think I'm most suited to be a R&amp;D chemist but no matter how much I research chemistry jobs, I feel like I dont have a good grasp of what positions are truly out there.

-My number 1 priority is just to be happy. My graduate experience requires me to essentially give up my personal life for 2 and a half years. While this was really rewarding for my chemistry abilities, it also took a long-term toll on my happiness from the constant deadlines, work at home and just an overall unbalanced lifestyle that felt out of my control. I dont see myself as a lazy person but I would like a job that doesnt require extensive work outside of work hours so I can have my own hobbies and do things that I want to do.

If you have read this far, thank you. I genuinly appreciate you taking the time and would love to hear what your personal experience has been. What did you do after graduating? What was the driving factor(s) behind your decisions? What was your education like prior to joining the work force? What is your industry work culture like? What would you have done different? Etc. Everything helps as I dont really have many knowledgeable people in my personal life.

Thanks again!

I mixed maybe ~600 ml of Muriatic Acid with probably ~30-40ml of Hydrogen Peroxide and put a large clump of Steel Wool in. It immediately started changing color to a dark greenish yellowish bluish color and started lightly bubbling. I assumed the bubbling was hydrogen gas since that's what was stated to be the result, but it absolutely wreaks of sulfur/human gas. I'm not sure what could be happening, but the smell quickly stunk up the garage so I moved it outside and very loosely covered with a lid to allow for venting of built up gas without allowing water to easily get in. It is currently a bluish color. I will attach links to the products I used, but I'm still at a loss. Any insight would be extremely helpful, I'm more of a blacksmith and metal working than a chemist.

5232,gn5o6r,What is going on,"As a kid, I was smart curious, a quick thinker, made connections obviously due to trauma. In kindergarten I was reading on a 5th grade level. Well long story short, trauma, abuse, neglect, my parents had drug addictions, led to me being put into foster care; into a home that was not only “structured”, but like a helicopter household. I got adopted when I was 9, and when that occurred, it’s like my brain shut itself down to obviously cope with the fact I was not going to be with my mother, but intellectually I slowed down a ton. I was never able to express my curiosity in the household, everything was black and white. So theoretically, I believe my brain shut itself down due to the fact that I knew I couldn’t express me creativity. I didn’t become “dumb” just my way of processing information decreased. 
So, 2 months ago, I contacted my mother for the first time since 2009. I am about to turn 20. Ever since then, and learning about the trauma I was dissociated with; I am processing information and coming up with theories like never before
They aren’t delusions, they make sense. My connections make sense. I have a therapist, I don’t have any crazy mental illnesses. 
But now I am processing information like I did as a little kid to survive (due to copious amounts of stress, but in a healthier way). Not as a “little kid”, but like An adult form of me as a little kid, everything is “clicking”, not even with learning about myself, EVERYTHING. Math has never been so easy, easy? It’s like common fucking sense to me now! I’m not even trying. My friends can see it, I sit here and think about theories that I come with in my fucking head, and just put it down on the piece of paper, I don’t even know what I wrote because my hand writing is so sloppy, and here I am talking about this, and I’m not even trying to think about anything; it’s just all splurging out
I don’t do any drugs or alcohol. Yes I vape, I’m trying to quit smoking, yes the occasional energy drink.
But I never have done this. I didn’t do this until I literally “heard” my mother’s voice over the phone. It’s like as soon as I heard her voice “boom”, my “brain” was reactivated. My therapist doesn’t even know what’s going on, my friends are like “man what the fuck, did you just get hit in the head and turn into a genius?” They said it as a joke at first, now they are like “no really like what the fuck”. 
I don’t know what the fuck is going on, it’s clearly not a mental or behavioral disorder. I know for a fact, this was due to my first communication “sequence” with my mother since I was 9 years old 2 months ago. I’m not even thinking about her, or my abuse or trauma. It’s like I am processing, and spitting out all this shit without even thinking, and it makes sense. My critical thinking skills are off the wall. 
Is this some psychological shit? Like does this happen? Like does hearing her voice activate a “childlike” feature I had, which is processing information and making connections at a drastic speed, obviously due to trauma, but at the same time, on my fathers side, his family are neurosurgeons and shit. I don’t know them well so obviously I’m not going to go to them. I almost want a fucking brain scan. My therapist is even like “uhhhhhh”, I went and started therapy because of this, and all I do is sit there and tell this guy my thoughts and theories, and he is sitting there Listening, and the whole session is me going on about some theory, or thought, or connections, he just Listens. I’ve already been tested for crazy shit, no, it’s not that. If this helps, my “MBTI” type is INTP-T, yes obviously a test like that has flaws and can’t give the most accurate depiction of my “brain”, but it’s like these last 2 months it’s like I psychologically adopted “acquired savant syndrome”, and I don’t have autism. No one in my family had any crazy mental illnesses, what is going on, why did I go from slightly above average to “holy shit man are you fucking Einstein” after I started communicating again?",6,2020-05-20 00:48:42,chemistry

I make my own, no problems, with calcium hypochlorite which is more cost effective and shelf stable than buying sodium hypochlorite solution.  That bit was easy.

&amp;#x200B;

I would really like to make it more 'splash-proof' as I use it for a lot more than just the toilet.  The product I used for years in UK has always been very thick and now is in gel form which makes it even thicker so it clings to the toilet bowl for quite a while after squirting it on.  I realise that there are probably 2 separate processes going on there, the cling I can live without but what can I use to thicken it up as it would be much easier for me to use?  

&amp;#x200B;

I've researched on and off over several years (every time it annoys me enough to try and solve it), but I'm not a chemist and the only thing I've been able to come up is  Dodecyl benzenesulfonic acid  which I'm not sure if I can get here in reasonably small amounts and I'm doubly sure isn't the right or the best thing.

&amp;#x200B;

The only other possibility I've come across is using something like kaolin as a thickener, but again I'm really not sure how that would go if left in the bleach bottle for a month or two or if it would react with the chlorine solution.  Liquid soap is much easier, just a bit of salt water does the trick, but this one is well over my head.  Any suggestions would be gratefully received.",17,2020-05-19 23:58:20,chemistry

5259,gmwbri,How to prevent Protodestannylation,"Hello everyone,

I prepared an aryltributylstannane compound in order to cross-couple it with an acid chloride. Stille conditions using palladium (or even other metal catalysts) failed and always only furnished the protodestannylated product. More successful attempts were made with an ipso-substitution by heating the arylstannane together with the acid chloride in mesitylene. But the protodestannylated product is still the major product next to a side product arising from decarbonylative cross-coupling of the acid chloride. Next, I would like to try classical Friedel-Crafts Acylation conditions using aluminium trichloride, changing the solvent to DCM and applying lower temperatures. However, since I already have a reaction on hand that worked, I wondered if there are any (general) concepts and strategies to prevent the protodestannylation? It would be also of great advantage to know why the destannylation could occur at all.
I think acids will favour the destannylation. All reactions were carried out under nitrogen atmosphere and dried glass apparatus. Using dry mesitylene led to no improvement rather to a deterioration. 

Many thanks in advance!

""A compound consists of of 26.67 carbon, 71.11 oxygen, 2.22 hydrogen per mass. If the relative formula mass of the compound is equal to 90, calculate the molecular (actual) formula of the compound.""

The empirical formula is then disovered to be CO2H which shows the simplest ratio of elements in the compound. The empirical mass of it will then be calculated as 45 g/mol. So then to get the ratio in the molecular mass which is 90 you double each number in the element ratio by two. 

This is what I don't get.

Why does the atom number double from the empirical mass to get the molecular mass? If I pour more of a substance to get more moles of it, the element number in the fixed ratio doesn't suddenly double per molecule, you only increase the compound number with elements in the same original ratio until you get 90g for the molecular mass. 

So the ratio of elements should stay the same if mass increases right?

I have just submitted my last assignment as a replacement for the exams. I am already getting on the ball of looking at jobs, but I still have this voice in my head of pursuing a Master's.

My undergraduate is in a Bsc of Pharmaceutical Science, and ideally, I want to pursue a life in Analytical Chemistry.

There are a few courses that peak my interest (only a few as I live in Ireland with limited institutions), however, I am still unsure if I should progress. The undergraduate course was based a lot on Analytical techniques, organic chemistry, and other modules such as GMP and Pharmaceutical Validation.

In short, I want to know if continuing on with my studies is the right choice. In regards to science degree's, how much more beneficial would it be to complete a Master's? Would I expect it easier to find work with higher pay? Would I be the preferred candidate Vs an undergraduate who has now had a year of experience?

Also with regard's to work, would it be of interest to look at a career abroad?

I would greatly appreciate any advice.",2,2020-05-18 21:01:05,chemistry
5310,gmf8vv,How do you study for Physical Chemistry?,"I just failed pchem at my institution. I didn't even take full on pchem that is 2 semesters, I took the one-semester version for Biological majors, my major is Biochemistry. I know most of it is just a deeper dive into general chemistry, but I failed due to personal reasons, not due to ineptitude. 

My point in this post is to ask how do you excel at this course, specifically preparing for midterms? I feel as though I was unprepared for this course in terms of practice. My professor didn't give us any practice exams or questions, just assigned homework problems. If anyone can provide me with useful practicing sources or anything, I would really appreciate it.

In order to confirm that I do in fact have O+ now, I did the test 6 months after giving birth and it still came out as O+. Does anyone know why and how it could have happened. I never had bone marrow transplant, malignancy, blood transplant or any autoimmune diseases. I only had a plasma transplant(it was my own plasma) when I was 16, I am going to be 39 this year. So, if anyone has any ideas or knows about why it would have happened, I would love to know.

Answer of which is a custard explosion (According to the show). However how did they know it was custard?

My knowledge of Chemistry is only secondary school level, so i can see that it's Glucose in solid form reacting with Oxygen in gas form

There is nothing in there that would indicate that it's custard, how do you know it's custard?

Of course it’s not the same but at least we had some work to do and we didn’t wasted time.

However, those solutions seem to use salts of metals that are either expensive (cesium) or toxic (thallium), and they may not be dense enough for all jobs.

I wonder whether one could use for that purpose a water suspension of nanoparticles of some heavy and relatively non-toxic metal, like tungsten or bismuth.  With proper coating, it should be possible to keep the nanoparticles suspended indefinitely, no?  Could one get a high enough concentration of particles to raise the bulk density above that of those salt solutions? 

The buoyancy of larger mineral grains would be determined by the bulk density of the suspension, not by that of the water alone.

I gather that suspensions of bentonite or other clays are used in oil drilling to make bits of rock easier to pump out of wells.  For whatever it is worth...",14,2020-05-17 00:11:32,chemistry

I love chemistry and biology and I follow a lot of different social network’s accounts about these topics; sometimes I see “lighthearted” memes and comments from chemists (or chemistry students) who claim things like “biologists are inferior scientists”, “c’mon, biology isn’t that hard to study”, “a biologist is basically a random person who like plants”, “how do you know he’s gay? Well, he study biology”, “biologist when they see a differential equation: *mom come pick me up I’m scared*”, etc.
As I just said, this is probably a joke, but where does this meme come from? I’ve seen similar jokes in other STEM accounts too (about physics, engineering...); it doesn’t matter which field of study they are about, the jokes are always about biologists (but it seems to me that chemists tend to do this more).
Of course I didn’t get offended or triggered, I’m not here to say everyone should stop with biology jokes and I don’t care if people like and share those posts (I like dank humor, so I don’t get easily offended because of jokes lol). I just really don’t understand the origin of this fake (and with funny intention) antagonism towards biologists.

I have been accepted to a top 5 chem PhD program and I am planning to go this Fall. However, this pandemics is killing me and I struggle with fears for grad school everyday.

I’m an international student and years studying in the states have been lonely. The pandemic only makes me more lonely since I was planning to go home for the summer before PhD but now I am stuck in the states, doing nothing and just feeling lonely and panicking. 

I’ve been struggling with some anxiety issues and I tend to worry a lot. I have to admit that I cried so many times during my undergrad because of various reasons. But I never gave up and I always manage to keep up with courses and research and my academics is perfect. 

So looking into grad school, I’ve heard so many horrible stuff and I wonder if any grad students are happy? Is there any life-work balance at all? I am panicking since I know nothing about the professors and nothing about whose lab I am going. And because of the pandemic, summer research is almost impossible so I’ll have to wait until September. Simply sitting home doing nothing makes me feel guilty and I grew rusty on my chemistry practical lab skills. 

I think no matter how depressed or anxious I am, I still have interests in chemistry and I want to do a PhD. But everyone around me seems sooo tough and determined and I wonder how can they be so fearless like that? I know I could be fragile, and anxious sometimes but does that just mean I have no shot finishing PhD? I guess I just want to know if anyone can relate with me!! Maybe you hesitated once, and was anxious and panicking, but still finish PhD after all?

5486,gkehyj,Process Chemist Job Experiences,"Hi everyone, I'll be graduating in a few days with a bachelor's in chemistry. Due to the pandemic, I have not been hearing much back from employers, and so I'll be graduating without a job in my field most likely. 

I was wondering if anyone had any experience working as a process chemist and can share their experiences, such as what the working conditions were like, pay, opportunity for promotions, and whether or not the experience was relevant in other positions/places of employment.

For context, one of the jobs I was looking at is for Gelest in the U.S, east PA. They have openings for process chemists requiring an associates degree, but preferring a bachelor's. The description says I'll be trained ""in the areas of synthetic chemistry and silicone polymer chemistry,"" and I'll ""be trained to independently carry out chemical reactions, perform purification techniques and evaluate analytical results of synthesized products.""

I will also need to be able to ""lift loads of up to 50 pounds,"" be ""responsible for operating various hand tools and pumps in a safe manner,"" and work a forklift, which seems odd. It seems like this job may be a cross between a white and blue collar position, (which I would be completely fine with, I need a job). I am concerned, however, that the job is actually just a blue collar job in chemical facility, and the chemical training mentioned would be merely about hazards. I would like some insight into whether I will gain any experience with *chemistry* that I can use in the future for other positions, and if this description is unusual for a process chemist, as I have not seen this in any other postings. If this is not going to supply me with experience in chemistry, I cannot imagine this position will advance my career opportunities.

TLDR; What have your experiences as process chemist been like (work conditions, pay, future opportunities) and is it unusual for a process chemist job description to include many blue collar job descriptions (lifting heavy loads, operating forklifts)?",7,2020-05-15 13:22:14,chemistry

I am using the Sigma protocol, which uses a hot/cold technique to dissolve the HPMC:

[https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product\_Information\_Sheet/2/h7509pis.pdf](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/docs/Sigma/Product_Information_Sheet/2/h7509pis.pdf)

It is my first time making this solution, and apparently, former members of the lab (not currently there) had trouble making it. I was thinking I would make up a total of 200 ml (1% HPMC solution). I am planning on heating up 67 ml, adding the powder (2 g) in steps (not all at once), and then stirring until the HPMC is evenly dispersed. After this, I am adding the remaining 134 ml of cold water (obtained from the fridge (4C)—then kept on ice), and will then continue stirring for at least 30 min. It doesn’t say in the protocol (at least it was unclear to me), but I’m assuming the solution can be stored at room temperature.

Any tips? It seems pretty straightforward, but perhaps I am missing something. Thank you.",0,2020-05-14 20:17:52,chemistry

5531,gjtduc,Device for electrolysis aquarium,"Hello everyone.

I don't know if they will be able to answer this for me, if this is the appropriate reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that I tried to make a ""doctor chihiros"" that is supposed to be a device that by electrolysis would help inhibit algae in an aquarium.

I made a ""diy"" version of hundreds of videos on youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

It is very simple: two stainless steel metal networks are used facing each other, without touching each other, and they are each connected to a pole (positive or negative) of a transformer. This generates a lot of visible small particles.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in the middle of the network, red particles began to be generated, with just a few minutes of use ... as if it were rust (for now ""stainless steel"" is not seen to be rusty ... if this is possible, but these particles are seen, which are then pushed by the same bubbles into all the water in the aquarium).

&amp;#x200B;

Rust is not good in an aquarium, it can kill fish, etc. So I would like to be sure of what is happening here.

Aquarium water is tap drinking water, which I also add calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate to to increase the hardness of the water (which is what my fish need).

&amp;#x200B;

I saw that this red is generated to several (in YouTube videos), although not many show it in the video where they teach you how to do it. What can this be red? Can I make this same device for electrolysis with two aluminum nets? If so, what kind of reaction could happen in the water? Would you change something to be aluminum?

&amp;#x200B;

We are happy to announce today a new [Spaya](https://spaya.ai) release featuring several key improvements to the software. As you may know, Spaya is [Iktos](https://www.linkedin.com/company/18179004/)'s retrosynthesis AI platform, available online as a **free** beta version at [spaya.ai](https://spaya.ai) (see some screen shots below). 

The features included in this new release deal with the enhancement of the underlying AI engine leading to an increased quality of the results, but also with the improvement of the user experience:

&amp;#x200B;

1- Improvements in the MCTS algorithm which constitutes the heart of our system now enable to **circumvent most regioselectivity issues**.

&amp;#x200B;

2- The reactions used by the algorithm can be linked to **several literature references**, enabling more options to explore the relevant literature for a proposed route. 

&amp;#x200B;

3- The user experience is enhanced by the implementation of **sleeker designs** and the addition of features such as the possibility to access **recently searched routes** or the display of routes within **clusters of similar disconnections**, instead of unaggregated listings as it was previously the case. We hope that this particular feature will provide a real improvement in the navigation and selection of the proposed routes.

 

We would be delighted to have you on the platform to test and help us improve it. Feel free to use it as you wish, and do not hesitate to ask for help or share your feedback with our team at [support@spaya.ai](mailto:support@spaya.ai).

This bonding releases energy by violently propelling the products of the reaction into surrounding molecules which generates heat.

One has its lone pair in a p-orbital that contributes to the structure's aromaticity and the other nitrogen has its lone pair in an sp2 hybridized orbital that does not contribute to the structure's aromaticity. Regardless of pH, histidine is aromatic and when histidine is protonated, it is resonance stabilized. So what am I missing here?

In light of this, I was wondering why then is Potassium \[Ar\]4s1 instead of \[Ar\]3d1? I've been searching online for a good answer, and I can't seem to find one. Any insight is appreciated, thanks!",5,2020-05-13 16:42:17,chemistry
5602,gj7uv9,A potent anaesthetic,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old boy working on a chemistry project. I’ve been working on an arrowhead for hunting, not for game. The project itself is a multipart, disposable, attachable and a tranquilizing arrowhead. My design also needs to be able to paralyse a prey of about 100kg (220 pounds) beyond possibility of movement.

The arrowhead is about 1.9 cm long (3/4 inch) and about half a cm in width (0.2 inch). The arrowhead has a harpoonshape and is build to break at the base as soon as the animal starts running. This will open a valve containing a potent enaesthetic that stuns the animal for a (short) while, length of time is less of an issue here.

Now my calculations show that I have around a single mL, give or take a few punya decimals, to store the anaestethic, but here my problem comes into play: I do not have an easy way to get such a strong anaestethic, nor do I have the money to easily obtain some online. I do however have a small, but extensive home-lab, including safety measures of course.

Tl;dr
Does anybody know any cheap/ easily accassible anaethetic that can paralyse a 100kg (220 pounds) animal using about a mL of fluid?


And for those whom may be curious:
I am a student planning to do a study in the field of Astrophysics in a few years, who spends a lot of his time researching the world around me. A short while ago a friend of mine asked me to make a cheap, disposable, but effective tranquilizer arrowhead for hunting big game, so I said I’d look into it. Only the anaesthetics I could get my hands on didn’t do the job, those were mainly plant-based and the ones you can buy at a pharmacy.",25,2020-05-13 16:10:12,chemistry

5616,gj2ch0,Lab Inventory - Bluetooth Stickers [x-post /labrats],"We make [free lab inventory software](https://labspend.com/) and have been considering offering Bluetooth stickers as a better way to monitor lab inventory. This type of product doesn't exist so reaching out to Reddit to get feedback and see if there's interest.

The benefit to labs would be massive time savings since it would essentially eliminate barcoding, scanning, quantity tracking and reconciliation tasks. Just instant updates through the phone in your pocket. The stickers are small and flexible enough to be placed on the majority of items.

Bluetooth Sticker Technical Details:

* 10m range (30 feet) in the lab
* 12 month battery life
* Water resistant
* Flexible (fits around the head of wine bottle, testing is tough sometimes)
* Size of an Avery barcode label (\~9 x 77 mm and 0.5mm thick or 1.1 x 3 inches and 0.2 inches thick), [image for perspective with someone's hand](https://imgur.com/Up6uxZ1)

We didn't go with RFID or NFC since they are similar to barcoding as far as distance and effort. 

We are targeting a price point of $2 per a sticker and production would be in about 8 to 12 weeks depending on the response. The initial production would be for 25,000 units and are asking if your lab or your stockroom wants an allocation. Labs commonly have 500 to 1,000 items  therefore we need about 50 labs that are interested (DM is fine).",16,2020-05-13 11:27:37,chemistry

5621,gj0ltp,I just want to confirm my understanding of bonds and dissolving.,"So just to confirm. When you have a covalent molecule (like ethanol), basically it dissolves by water via hydrogen bonding, in which the positive dipoles of ethanol attract to the negative oxygen dipoles in water. So the ethanol covalent molecule DOES NOT break apart into individual ions right? This would only happen with ionic compounds, like NaCl. Speaking of NaCl, NaCl would ONLY dissolve in water when the ions dissociate into Na+ and Cl- ions and attract to the water right? Just to make sure, covalent molecules don't break up into ions, whereas ionic compounds DO break up. Also, if ethanol were to boil by putting in energy, the individual bonds within ethanol (like C-C, C-H), would NOT break apart, right? Only the attractions between different ethanol molecules would break apart via intermolecular forces? Only intramolecular forces break apart covalent ethanol molecules, right? Or is it not possible to ever break up a covalent molecule? Sorry for the really long message, I really want to understand this subject, and my books don't do a good job of making it easy to understand. I was thinking a human explanation would benefit :).

5669,gihrb4,Pursuing an AS in Chem before going on to getting a BSc. Only have enough credit hours for bio + lab or phys + lab.,"I’m going to be pursuing an AS in Chem from the local community college before transferring to a 4-year to finish the BSc.

However, looking at the required courses for the AS, I’m forced to pick either Biology I &amp; II with labs or Physics I &amp; II with labs. Which would be the most beneficial?

Of course, I’d ideally see myself working to develop new drugs from natural materials (i.e. fungi and plants). However, the BSc program has no bio reqs, whereas it does require Physics I &amp; II.

Alternatively, the BA track does require Micro (and the Physics courses). Would I benefit more from a BA here? Or am I better off using elective credits for the bio classes?

New updates for Synthetic Challenge/Relay, we have a subreddit! Check us out at [r/SyntheticChallenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/SyntheticChallenge/)!!!

This week we'll be starting with [This molecule](https://imgur.com/x9eUJ3g)!

**RULES**

1. For each user in the relay, they can post **once every 3 posts**
2. Upper limit of **10 carbons** for every relay segment
3. Please explain your reaction by: a) Providing a mechanism OR b) Referencing publications OR c) If you are uncertain, make a note that you require verification and another relay member can verify you reaction by providing the above information.
4. **Please provide the ChemDraw (.cdx) file if you draw your molecule with ChemDraw;** if you don't have ChemDraw, that is okay you can continue the relay without providing the ChemDraw file. It is a way for other's to have an easier time with the relay process.
5. No polymers unless you justify your reasoning.

Well, that's not always the case. You see, I needed to finish this online government class this week in order to graduate. The only thing standing between me and my diploma was this 7 page paper asking me to assess the quote unquote ""balance"" of the American government system. Well, I needed a way to fill up space--fast. I didn't know enough philosophical government jargon to fill it with that (heck, I probably couldn't write more than a paragraph using the information I learned in that good-for-nothing course), so I opted for the analogy route. Naturally, I compared the US to an acid base reaction where democracy is a buffer solution. Basically, I said US politics doesn't shift too much everytime a new president gets into office (like how the pH would change super quick without a buffer) because checks and balances and stuff (like buffer solutions) keep things from shifting too far from the norm until a serious amount of change occurs in the population (like when the moles of OH- or H+ ions exceed the buffers capacity). In the end I wrote four thick paragraphs explaining how acid base reactions work and how it's just like the government, which meant that I succeeded in including very few sensible arguments in my essay. And people say AP Chemistry is useless in everyday life!

I’m interested in recreating the Viking lye soap, which the people would use for cleaning, lice removal, and vanity. I have a few questions though.  

1. Do you think they made soaps of a higher strength for hair bleaching? Or did they perhaps apply and leave the soap on the hair for a long while? 

2. How is lye soap not toxic to the body? I had always heard it was, but in my research I found that people still use lye soap to this day, and will make it while camping and such. Does the addition of fat cause the lye to become safe? 


3. For the fat, would it be possible to use a plant fat? If so, what qualities would the plant fat need to have? 

If anyone happens to know a real recipe they used, that would be helpful. Every article I’ve read has simply mentioned the fact that they used the lye soap, without saying how.

So we know that everything’s a little soluble in water, even though we say it’s insoluble (like AgCl has an dissolution equilibrium in water. And then for an oxide, like WO3, the equilibrium disassociation in water would be something like this:
WO3 ⇌ W6+ + 3O 2- 
*i don’t think this is correct but I haven’t experimented with/learned about this too much*

But for a compound like H2WO4 (Or WO3*H2O), what would the equilibrium reaction be? I have 3 possible thought.

      1. Would the water just come off and leave separate WO3 and H2O?

      2. Would it act like WO3 and partially dissolve one or more O 2- ions off and leave WO2 2+/W 6+ ?

Welcome back to Week 130 of Synthetic Challenge. With everything going on the world, hope everyone in the community is safe. Hopefully this challenge will distract you while you're on a work from home adventure. Stay home, don't go to the lab!

Since the topic has been a bit on the downlow for a couple of weeks, I have decided to attempt revival with everyone's favorites, nucleic acid derivates.

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

5795,ghdvhg,Two common experiments explained by the gas laws,"Hi r/chemistry. So I've been thinking about how two common demos/experiments can be explained by the gas laws. Unfortunately, there are also a lot of varying answers about *which* gas law can explain them. From what I understand, they are all very interrelated so it could be several? But if possible, I'd like to see if each phenomenon can be attributed to one gas law. 

The [first one](https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/why-does-the-water-rise/) involves a plate of colored water (for easy viewing), a lit candle, and a cup placed over it. Water is then pulled (pushed, rather?) into the cup once the flame is extinguished. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong or if I missed anything. Basically, the flame heats up the air in the cup, so it expands (**volume**) and escapes from the cup (presumably when this happens you can see air bubbles, but I didn't). Then once the flame is extinguished because all the oxygen is gone, the air cools so it condenses (still **volume**?). This, of course, also results in a lower **pressure**. As a result, the greater atmospheric pressure pushes the water in, and it does so until pressure is the same on both sides (because now there's a lower **volume** in the cup, resulting in higher **pressure**). At least, that's what I believe to be happening. So in this case, what gas law would you attribute to being... the cause for this? 

Probably not Gay-Lussac's(?)... Boyle's Law, sure: because the water flowing into the cup in the end lowers the volume of the non-water part of the cup, increasing the pressure of the remaining gas (in this case, should be CO2). Charles' Law(?)... I'm not sure. Yes, the gas expanded when it was heated up, but I don't know if this is simply because things move faster when they're hotter which is just behavior or if it's the law in particular (also pressure has to be held constant, so is it initially?).

Then that brings in the [second experiment](https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/lab/experiments/incredible-can-crusher/) in which a can implodes. Same here. I'll try to explain what I think is happening, but I'm not sure if it can be attributed to a specific gas law. 

So the water in the can is heated. It turns to water vapor, and pushes out the remaining air in the can. When it's inverted into cold water, all that steam condenses into water and as a result, the volume in the can is instantly and significantly reduced. Same with pressure. So it's crushed by the higher surrounding atmosphere. I can see... all three here? 

I hope this question makes sense, and I can elaborate if needed. Thank you guys!",1,2020-05-10 20:15:04,chemistry

Optional background:
I'm a rising junior, chem major, and I've been in a lab since sophomore fall semester. My graduate student is done and off to industry though, so I helped her wrap up her last projects. The PI said to relax and he'll find someone I could work with next, but with the virus shutdown, things have been on hold, no summer work (I actually was accepted to an REU for the summer too).

My PI and I are on good terms, and we've also talked about allowing me to be involved enough to get some kind of authorship. I have doubts still about putting hours into two places too (even if ochem is done, I still have more lab courses). It might be best to stay.

But if I ever wanted to switch labs, right now seems like the only time to do so. I get along with my second semester ochem prof and we've talked a lot about class concepts, and academia, chemistry career paths, etc. If he has space, I think he'll be willing to accept me. My first semester ochem prof might accept me too, but he did tell me focus on one lab and get published.

As an undergrad, I know all research experience is good experience, so I'm not focusing on research topics as much. My goal is to live in a chem lab for the next two years, graduate with some level of authorship, and aim for a grad program. Oh, and not burn out.",2,2020-05-10 00:13:21,chemistry

\- You always have sodium in your sample unless you dont. (for context, we looked at the spectral lines of our sample when we analysed the soluble kations and sodium pretty much dominates the colour of the flame and is almost impossible to clean off the platinum wire)

\- Mercury is more precious than copper but not as precious than your dime. (meaning that holding your (euro)cent into a solution with dissolved mercury can cause it to deposit on it but it could be unreliable)

I'm guessing IUPAC changed the nomenclature to whatever oxidation number the metal has it's gonna be _-ate_ ending in complexes because it made too much misunderstanding and seeing _-ite_ endings is just an older way.

How do one design an experiment to determine this 29 kJ/mol value? What equipment and instrumentation is involved? I'm assuming that you need a way of flowing heat into a sample of material such that no heat is lost into the surroundings, while simultaneously monitoring the conformation of the molecule in real-time.

Also, how do you go ""in reverse"" once you've calculated this value to determine a specific temperature? Let's say I didn't do this experiment, so I don't have the empirically determined temperature values. How does one go from a value of 29 kJ/mol and calculate a specific temperature that will impart enough energy at thermoequilibrium to reach this energy threshold?

&amp;#x200B;

So… What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?

**1. Electric potential energy of the electrons and the protons.**

It is equal to the work that would be required to bring them together, which would be higher if they were further apart, therefore that’s why we say that larger atomic orbitals have higher energy.

The so-called “chemical energy”–which is due to the formation of chemical bonds–is just a subset of this.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Kinetic energy of everything that changes position inside that molecule relative to other parts of the molecule:**

* electrons
* protons (this could be split further into elementary particles)
* neutrons (this could be split further into elementary particles)

This should include the so-called “molecular vibrations”.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Kinetic energy of the molecule as a whole, relative to an external point.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Magnetic potential energy.**

It is equal to the cooperative effect of the spin-bearing molecular entities.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Gravitational potential energy.**

Infinitesimal, but it exists because the molecule as a whole has a net mass, and one could go in even more detail here and look at all the elementary particles from its composition that have mass and gravitational potential energy in relation to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Nuclear binding energy.**

It is the minimum energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus, thus overcoming the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together.

One could go into even more detail and talk about the strong force that keeps quarks together to form neutrons and protons, aka the quantum chromodynamic binding energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Rest energy.**

This could be considered a synonym for mass, since all the elements with mass from the molecule have a potential energy due to the energy-mass equilvance that follows from the special theory of relativity.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

\- Thermal energy follows because of 2. and 3.

\- Radiant energy is temporary. But indeed, if you’d take a big sample of molecules, it’s likely that some of them would be in an excited state, therefore, in time, they’d give off photons when orbitals drop in electric potential energy.",31,2020-05-07 14:31:52,chemistry

6001,gfafdu,Home synthesis of inorganic pigment YInMn Blue,"Brief background: YInMn Blue is an inorganic pigment created by accident in 2009, and generally understood to be the first stable, inorganic blue pigment that had been created since Cobalt Blue almost 200 years earlier. Here's a [link](https://chemistry.oregonstate.edu/content/story-yinmn-blue) if you want more story/details. Inorganic blue pigments are surprisingly rare, naturally or otherwise, and even now there's only a handful of them. 

After learning about it, I really wanted to get my hands on it but it's not widely available to the public. Probably because one major ingredient is indium oxide, and indium is expensive. So I decided to synthesize it, which required me to obtain temperatures of &gt;1000°C in my kitchen, which I managed to get with an antique dental inlay furnace (that I worked to death in the process).

I left a [detailed overview](https://www.sciencemadness.org/whisper/viewthread.php?tid=155277) of the synthesis process on ScienceMadness, including the equipment I needed so I won't go into detail here.

Here's the ground oxide mix before firing:

Here's the product after firing:

[\(The white bits I think are from the crucible lid which had stuck onto the crucible after firing\)](https://preview.redd.it/e9lmd2mbgdx41.jpg?width=1649&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0cbfa65667562d4bdfb04df4e2c079584a56f7b1)

I wanted to repeat this using slightly different methods, but I murdered the furnace. I'm getting a new (and relatively cheap) metallurgy furnace which will hopefully not die and shouldn't be full of asbestos. 

Some observations from this: 

1. It's a very pretty color approaching indigo, digital cameras don't seem to do justice.
2. The original synthesis calls for manganese (III) oxide, but substituting that for manganese dioxide seems to work as well, which is convenient because manganese dioxide is a bit more available. 
3. The original paper also formed the pigment into a pellet using high pressure before firing, and I was worried this would be necessary for decent yield, but it seems like it's not. In general it's a surprisingly forgiving synthesis, if you get the temperatures required.",31,2020-05-07 12:00:47,chemistry

- Psyllium husk “flour”, this is 50% of the solution. (Might thin this out with Microcrystalline cellulose if I can find a supplier)
- Sodium bicarbonate to adjust pH
- Glycerol for moisture

Should I try to calculate the resulting pH value based on ingredients or measure it and adjust? This seems unpredictable to be.

6158,gduvwn,Computational Chemistry On A Blockchain,"Hello, I recently published a peer-reviewed research article in the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry flagship journal, Chemical Science, Titled: ""Computational chemistry experiments performed directly on a blockchain virtual computer"".

I thought that this might be of interest to some of you here, so I will cross post this as I'm currently trying to get some feedback from people who work in the blockchain space. The article details the first instance of a physical simulation (computational chemistry in this case) being performed entirely within a blockchain virtual machine. In this case the experiment was a proof-of-principle study using a simple harmonic potential to model the trajectory of a vibrating carbon monoxide molecule. I have also discussed the potential benefits of this type of calculation in terms of censorship resistance, reproducibility, and provenance in theoretical scientific work.

Well, 30 minutes later, I parked and went to get something out of my trunk, the fluid was dry but I could see some dry residue on the windshield. This sent me into a fit of anxiety (as per usual). Is it possible that the methanol in the washing fluid (contrary to my belief) does not evaporate fully and does leave a toxic residue? I keep wondering about all the times I spritzed while driving nonchalantly with my windows rolled down, what if some of that stuff had gotten inside the car/on my skin/ on my handbag?

I'm really sorry if this question is placed in the wrong forum, but I think you guys can help me out.

Me and a friend of mine are hobby photographers and we had the idea to set a skateboard on fire and push it towards the camera.

The problem is that we want to be abled to do several shots in case some fail. But that is not possible if the board burns down completely after the first attempt.

It's important that the material that's actually burning is as invisible as possible. Solving this the simple way, like with putting cardboard on top of a metal sheet on the board, won't work because the board itself has to look as ""normal"" as possible in order for our picture to look natural.

6280,gcy4ad,Safe coating to make a 3D printed respirator mask airtight,"What is a good example of something safe that could be applied as a coating layer to the walls of a 3D printed respirator mask to make them trully airtight (seal pores and fissures) while (ideally) satisfying the following criteria?:

&amp;#x200B;

\- Not air permeable at the pressures created when a person inhales

\- No (or low) VOC outgassing from the coating

\- Does not impose health risks to the respirator wearer

\- Can be applied by dipping (or maybe spraying)

\- Forms a thin layer that is flexible enough not to crack during normal use of the mask

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some materials I have been considering for the job:

&amp;#x200B;

\- White glue (school PVA glue): Seems safe. Is is airtight?

\- Water based liquid rubber: some SDS suggest it's safe. It's marketed as watertight (but is it AIRtight?)

\- Some sort of commom paint?

&amp;#x200B;

Silicone caulk might not be an option, since it's too viscous and would be a mess to apply to the outside of the respirator, rendering an unprofessional finishing. I should note that I could possibly apply it only to the inside of the walls, but I intend to coat all surfaces, just to be extra safe.

&amp;#x200B;

If someone here could suggest some potential coating materials or knowlwdge bases where I could check their non-permability/safeness, I would be really grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

As I'm not a native speaker, I apologize for any broken grammar.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The problem: It is well known that 3D printed objects are usually not exactly airtight, due to microfissures. To make things worse, I ordered a DIY 3D printed respirator mask (composed of ABS plastic) that is visibly permeable to air (one can literally see the tiny gaps all across it's walls' surfaces through which air and viruses could come in when the wearer inhales).",4,2020-05-03 15:59:12,chemistry

Biotechnology graduate switching to Chemistry for the Master.,"I have a B.S. in environmental/industrial biotechnology and in september I want to start a master in chemistry (I found out I like it more and my two interships were all working in chemistry labs on chemical engineering research topics).

the university I'm interested in is offering a new master in Sustainable Chemistry (I think it's 1 or 2 years old)  that basically blends green chemistry technologies and environmental science stuff (regulations, LCA, etc). I'm tempted to apply because I perfectly fit the ECTS requirements and I can straight up get in with no tests, but also I'm worried that such a novel master might not be well estabilished/organized and might not be recognized as valid by employers.

I could also apply for the regular Chemistry master in the same department, which is well estabilished and has good reputation, but I'd need to take a test on all B.S. Chemistry knowledge to get in. it would definitely be a lot more work for me (both the test and the programme), but I've already been studying all the recommended topics to catch up.

what do you think? is such a novel master worth it? I'm afraid it might just be watered down chemistry for environmental scientists and it's hard to tell if it offers good employability since it's so new.",5,2020-05-03 09:46:57,chemistry

Dear chemists, 

I'm a teacher myself (I teach Maths &amp; Physics) but I'm also a part of a non-profit organization, the Inspiring Science Association. Our main goal is to enhance and encourage scientific vocations. We want to inspire young people to pursue a career in science by showing them how research is conducted and what it is like to be a scientist.

To do so, we have arranged the Online International Science Engagement Challenge (Online ISEC). Here, participants between the ages of 16 and 24 will have the opportunity to work on a scientific project designed to fit their interests and scientific background. These projects serve as an introduction to scientific research, while simultaneously being individualized and challenging. Students will be expected to work independently, delve into the available literature, and write a scientific report. They will work under the supervision and guidance of one of our knowledgeable mentors, who will support, guide, and encourage them throughout camp.

Online ISEC is a free, online initiative which will happen from June 29th to July 26th. Participants will choose two weeks within these dates to complete their projects. We are currently receiving applications! (Deadline is May 10)

This year I will be running some of the maths and physics projects so feel free to ask me more details. If you are interested, please check our website or contact me! Any help to spread the word around would be indeed appreciated :)

If I had to guess what made something brittle, my instinct says the molecules are close but weakly bonded? And flexibility is more likely for less dense, but more strongly bonded materials? 

I’ve heard terms like elasticity limit regarding brittleness - is that how it’s defined/tested? And if so, is that an intrinsic property of the material, or can it change (e.g. temperature springs to mind as something that could affect it). 

Also, is it possible to define anything except a solid as brittle/flexible? For example, could water surface tension be viewed as an example of flexibility in a liquid?",3,2020-05-01 23:16:19,chemistry

I'm a mechanical engineering major and my background in chemistry is rather poor. However I took a class concerning rocket engines which also includes thermochemical reactions (in a very simple form) like burning LH2 and LOX stoichiometrically. I really got hooked on the topic! So much fun! When reading further in scripts and books about other fuels, I found ""Aerozin 50"" and the famous ""RP-1"".

However the Chemical formulas for these fuels contain commas in the numbers (sorry for my horrible description, I still have to learn a lot about chemistry!) \[I used spaces to mark a new atom.\]

Aerozin 50: C\_2 H\_15,6 N5,7  
RP1: C\_11,7 H\_21,8

I've also added a screenshot. Can somebody explain to me what these commas mean?

Interestingly, and I don't know whether this might have been an oversimplification, recently I computed the molecular formula for Aerozin50 for myself. My textbook says that it is a 50/50 (mole-wise) micture of UDMH (C\_2 H\_8 N\_2) and Hydrazin (N\_2 H\_4). This gives me a formula for Aerozin50:

C\_1 H\_6 N\_2

From my limited understanding small molecules have certain shapes and proteins have complex shapes. Whether or not a small molecule will bind to a protein is determined by whether or not it will 'fit' into the protein at some place (is this correct?).

If this is the case, can we take a comprehensive list of all small molecules, build up their shapes in a computer, and then just try them all out against a protein of our choice to see if they can possibly bind? Meaning, whether or not they 'fit'? Or this what people already do?

Ultimately i'm trying to figure out if there is some calculation you just can use to find out if a small molecule will bind to a certain protein.

I'll definitely have questions about my study the further I move into college life, but for now, as a graduating high school senior, I have some questions about the careers and jobs I can get with a chemistry degree.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Are there any feasible jobs I can find with a BS in Chem? How difficult is the job market for people in that situation? What are the average salaries for those various jobs? I don't really care if its in academia / industry / medical industry.
2. I know that graduate school is a popular choice for chemistry students which allows you to develop more knowledge and skills to find higher-end jobs. I read from several sources that getting a doctorate in chem is apparently ""self-sufficient"" in that it somehow free in a way? How does that work? If I wish to pursue chemistry for graduate school, how financially feasible is it for someone who doesn't have much family financial support? How many years would it take to get an advanced degree to get a high-paying job?
3. I know that for many technological / scientific careers, studying chemistry is extremely important / essential. Is it easier to find work in the fields of academia or within industry? Which one tends to pay better? I'd be pretty stoked to have a career doing high-end research at a university. Does that have high pay?
4. I live in Southern California, so if possible it would be nice to find jobs around here. How is the chemistry job market for my area?
5. How different will the answers to the above questions be if I switched to a Chemical Engineering major?

As you can see, money is a fairly influential factor in my decisions, but so is my love of chemistry. I just want to find a high-end job while still pursuing my dream of studying the sciences.",8,2020-05-01 01:56:18,chemistry

I used exact ratios and purity of isopropyl alcohol + h2o + h2o2. I put the final solution into dry 1L HD-PE bottles previously cleaned by boiled/chilled water and bleach solution. I then added 20 drops of blue colour ""brilliant blue FCF (E133) in glycerin (E422)"" just so everybody knows what it is. 

* So what is this whit-ish cloud from the bottom of the bottle? 
* Did I mess it up by adding that colour? (same thing is used in food colouring)
* Or did the plastic of the bottle melt?
   * I did research what kind of bottle to use for this and HD-PE seemed to be unaffected by all 3 of the main chemicals.
* Should I discard it all or just extract the top clear part (without disturbing the bottom)?

6542,gaxs0g,Should I go for a degree in chemistry if I’m bad at calculus and inorganic?,"Hi everybody. At the beginning of this semester I decided to get an extra dose of chemistry by taking inorganic chem I as an elective along with Orgo II since I’m currently a bio major/chem minor on the premed track. I naïvely did this because I figured I could potentially go into the field of chemistry if medical school doesn’t work out just in case since I really enjoyed Orgo 2 lecture and lab more than any bio course I have taken.

Unfortunately my performance in inorganic and Calc 1 was awful than I expected due to poor work ethic and time management (Cs in both classes but A in Orgo2). And with all my classes going online only made things worse. Which is why I’ll be selecting P so that it doesn’t hurt my gpa. That being said if I ever go into the field of chemistry I’d rather be working with organic or biochemistry since those are the areas of chemistry that interest me the most. I only understood a little bit of assigning point groups, calculating lattice enthalpy, and molecular geometry, but everything else that involves mo diagrams and hcp, ccp, and all that weird cubic stuff made little to know sense to me.

I has been a while, so I can't really remember the answer to this question. 

- I remember that carbon has some special properties that allow life to from. I think it has something to do with the number of orbitals filled? But it's not just carbon, it's every element in that column of elements. Is this correct? What is it exactly that makes carbon special? 

- The search for life-baring exoplanets -- as far as I know -- searches for carbon based life. Is this still true? Why? I've heard it's because carbon is much more common in the universe. Is this because carbon can be fused in stars while silicon would have to be formed in some kind of stellar explosion like a supernova? And does that mean as the universe ages, there will be more and more silicon (+ other elemental) based life? 

- While I'm here, I also can't remember what makes water such a special molecule.It seems so strange to me that it's the only substance I can think of that is *less* dense as a solid than it is a liquid. Are there any other molecules like that? Could another molecule support life as well as water? Would a silicon based life-form still need water? Would the need oxygen??

I am having a very very hard time comprehending papers from potential groups I’m interested in joining. The content is extremely dense, plus my current knowledge and scope of the field are severely limited.

While I conduct bioanalytical research at my undergrad, I am a polymer major. The stuff I learned tho doesn’t translate very well into practical skills or aid me in understanding the research done by these groups.


I know the fundamentals... like the various polymerization, living or not. I’m okay with polymer physics and understand how conditions affect compositions... I also took a course on polymer processing. But again these fundamentals don’t directly translate into research on covalent organic framework , enzyme encapsulation, self assembly. 


The textbook I’m reading is written 20 years ago. I tried reading reviews on current developments... still can’t get over the initial barrier.

Do you have good textbook/paper recommendations for me to building vocabs and insight? 

Any suggestion on how to approach a completely new research area is also greatly appreciated.

This sample travels through roughly 350 ft. 3/8 in. black tubing to the probe. It takes approximately 2.5 minutes for the sample to reach the probe. The problem lies in the fact that at the sample point the chlorine residual is roughly around 0.25 mg/L but by the time it reaches the probe the chlorine residual is around 0.02 mg/L. My boss and I have talked it over and we have ruled out the UV rays from sunlight because of the black tubing. We have also ruled out heat because the water is not sitting in the tube, it travels fairly fast so we do not believe heat is a factor. Their is a fair bit of sediment in the vessel, where the probe lies, and I clean it out often but is there any plausible reason that sediment could kill the residual.

Last Thursday (\~4 days ago) my mother, who is a middle school science teacher, left a couple of iron nails soaked in vinegar, in a plastic glass. Through the days, I believed they would form iron (III) oxide.

Yet my findings are in this picture, which is similar to a [Google Images search for iron (III) acetate](https://www.google.com/search?q=iron+acetate&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk02MN1_kyCTqWVuNeqwE2U6cjAcnVw:1587998802446&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiEvpfE7IjpAhWjA9QKHaUuBP0Q_AUoAXoECBEQAw&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=625). I have done a quick check and found out that iron (III) oxide is insoluble in water and iron (II) acetate is rather white or slightly coloured. 

Is it right that I conclude that this is iron (III) acetate?

My doctor advised me to take dietary fibre supplements for the constipation to treat it, prevent gallstones and in return, pancreatitis. I know you have to take a combination of both insoluble and soluble dietary fibre. 

My general understanding is that insoluble fibres are to attract water to the stool and soluble dissolves in the water of the intestines (what for?) and can help improve the glycaemic index of diabetics (most beneficial for me).
What I want to know is what determines the solubility of a compound in water? (i.e., how do I know inulin is more soluble over gum?) 

*1. What are the factors?*

I know that compounds containing another certain   compound (there was a table given to us called the solubility guidelines in high school which I can remember some of them) inside of it like (Cl-) makes them soluble or insoluble but even then there are exceptions which makes it even more confusing like for example C228H382O191 (Inulin). Inulin doesn’t even contain any of the compounds in the solubility guidelines so now I’m even more confused even though I graduated with an A in chem! 

*2. Since I have prior chemistry knowledge, can I just determine it by looking at the IUPAC name or compound structure?*

I'm asking because the constipation is getting a little too annoying for me and I don't want to get pancreatitis. Also, it would be nice to have my GI improved since I'm diabetic.

Can't the anode metal itself just dissolve to produce electrons in the reaction, so why do we initially need dissolved ions?  Is it just so the current can flow (to make a closed circuit)?  If this is the case, why do the ions need to be the same element as the metal anode?  Is this just so they don't mess up the reaction?

**𝝙p = ± (𝜌 \* L)/(g)** 

for combustion gas pressure drop (derived from *Ergun equation*). I have found this formula in the literature, but I'm not sure whether it's correct. 

* **𝝙p** ... pressure drop \[Pa\]
* **𝜌** ... density of combustion gas mixture \[kg/m^(3)\]
* **L** ... height of the fixed bed (inside adsorbed) \[m\]
* **g** ... gravity acceleration \[m/s^(2)\]

The problem is that I get a **𝝙p** \[kg\*s^(2) / m^(3)\] which isn't Pascal. Also, **𝝙p** is ridiculously small (*I assume that I determined the density of combustion gas correctly - knowing its composition and amount of each substances: H2O, CO2, N2, O2, CO, NO, SO2 - I simply made a sum of its densities multiplied by its amount - for example the density of CO2 6.17 kg/m**^(3)* *at 400 kPa, 344 K and CO2 amount is 12 % vol., so 6.17 \* 0.12*)...

One thing however, is that I'll have more of a limit on the amount of water I can use for cooling my condenser since it will likely just be a pail with my pump in it, and it won't conduct heat away nearly as well as the metal sink I was using before could.  


I was wondering if people here have seen any professional setups, or DIY ones that take a page from the custom PC water cooling book, and use a radiator and fans to maintain the temperature of the water in the condenser, vs having a large reservoir of water, or running chilled water with ice through it.  


It would only be able to get to ambient temperature at best, but I would imagine water even at 30 degrees would do a decent job depending on what you were trying to distill.  


It seems like it would be kind of neat to simply have a box with a 240mm radiator, or maybe larger, that you hook up to the condenser, add some distilled water to, and let run, which could be much more compact than a large pail of water.  


I might give it a shot at some point, though I don't really feel like spending the money on even a cheap, but still copper+brass radiator which is about $70, though thinking about it there won't really be any issues with mixed metals so aluminum would do just fine depending on pump construction.

Second year Chemistry student here, with 2 more years to go. I've tried talking to my parents about this and they said I shouldn't be so picky and keep changing my mind so often etc, i.e. not helpful. 

I detest chemistry, and I've only realized that after I was in too deep to leave or transfer. Put simply, the thought of doing Chemistry after university makes me sick. I only chose to study it because my parents were trying to talk me into med school and Chemistry was my favorite subject in school. Dropping out of my course is not an option. I'm doing pretty well and I'm pretty sure I can get top grades. 

Everybody says chemistry can open many doors for you, should you decide academia or R&amp;D is not for you, and I've been reading quite a lot of testimonials of people going into all sorts of jobs with their chemistry degrees. I'll be looking into moving back to Canada once I finish my studies in the UK and I've heard the demand for chemists is quite low back there, so finding a good job in that field might be difficult as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Now onto my question:

***I'm not sure if I should drop my integrated MS Chemistry to BS and do an MS in Data Science.***  

I'm hesitant because I'm not 100% sure if I'm the right fit for DS and also because employers tend to have mixed feelings about those courses. Also, most Data Scientists today don't have these degrees because they did something else in school, they might've picked up these skills on the way or as a hobby, and most importantly, they are all very new so we're yet to witness their usefulness. So I'm not sold on the idea of having to tick the box. 

The alternative would be something finance-related or a government job, if I'm not the right fit for DS. 

At the moment, I can't use any programming language, but I'm gonna be working on it after my summer exams. I know some absolute basic Python and that's about it. I like collecting and processing data, and I find it easy to see patterns in a given set of data etc. 

I'm really good at languages (or so I've been told). I speak 4 languages fluently. I'm very good at math. 

***If you think the transition is viable, what steps should I take to ensure the smoothest transition possible, in terms of my qualifications, internships, self-study etc?***

6876,g844q3,An Island Nation with Legalized Drugs," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

so during my internship, i had to make zinc phosphate glasses, and in order to generate phosphorus pentoxide, i had to use two types of precursors: mono-ammonium and di ammonium phosphate.

Its normal to have an overall mass loss during pretreatment and melting processes due to loss of water and ammonium, but now i have to explain why did i have a loss of P2O5, which can explain the mass loss of the final glass.

 For pretreatment and melting i used platinum crucibles, and one way to explain P2O5 loss was leaving some of the glass in the crucible after quenching. but the mass loss also has something to do with the type of precursor used. so how can i explain this?

I want to make liquid soap from bar soap.

Why?  Because it *should* be cheaper.  And I hate single use plastics.  So, after I buy a 23.5 fl oz Dove + Men care pump bottle, I want to buy the bar equivalent, and make some liquid soap to put in it.

I see some recipes online.  But I'm wondering if anyone does this regularly and has some exact ratios and/or directions?  I see examples of just soap and water, and other examples of soap, water, and glycerin.  I have all of those ingredients, but I'm not sure the glycerin is required/useful.

Also, via research, I've noticed that bar soaps typically have sodium hydroxide, and liquid soaps have potassium hydroxide, and I don't know if you can just add water to a sodium hydroxide soap to liquify it?  Interestingly, the Dove liquid version does not have potassium hydroxide (neither do, and neither list sodium hydroxide either).

https://old.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/g7n9m5/being_a_chemistry_major_is_very_lonely_fck_premeds/ 

This post is for the person who posted ""Being a chemistry major is very lonely. F*ck pre-meds"" before you deleted your connection to the post. I don't know who you were so I couldn't DM you, but I figured you checked /r/chemistry, and you'd see this post at some point. And if you don't... well... farewell, fellow chemist. I hope you're feeling better and that things get better for you. 

First off, for those of you who were supportive to said person, thank you. For those of you who came out in an unnecessarily aggressive tone to him/her, that was not very nice of you, was it? If that person had an attitude went against something you believe in, given that that person explicitly said he/she was lonely, shouldn't you try to be supportive and create a healthy community helping him/her understand your point of view instead of throwing a two-liner comment that may have put that person in a worse situation? I felt the same way as him/her at a similar stage of my life and that made me really depressed. Really depressed to not have friends who thought like me in what we chose to study, and really depressed in seeing such terrible attitude around me at all times. Not depressed enough to want to take my life away, but still depressed. We don't know what that person was going through. I hope this message get to the person, but if another person felt bad enough to take his/her life away for it, your comment could have been the last drop for a series of bad turn of events. I've always taken pride of the chemistry community for being supportive to one another, and I don't think your attitude corroborated what I've always claimed. Know how to pick your battles guys, and if you don't have something nice/supportive to say, just... don't. Or try not to :-/


`========================`

Dude or dudette,  

Here are an assumption that I take from your post: I assume that you're in an American academic institution, since you're talking about pre-meds. 

I'm really sorry about your experiences. I also hated that attitude. It was not good and it was toxic. 

I should really try to become a better person, but I didn't like them then, and I still resent everything that they've done to me and my friends. In my school, they were not limited to that. They stole my materials, they ripped my friend's books, they stole books from another friend of mine, etc. It was not all of them, but many did do things to make sure that others would be below them or people who were just fucking interested in learning the material would not kill the curve. I didn't even fucking care about grades. I just cared about learning and being my best self in that field, but even so, they'd go the extra mile of making me feel shitty for having a GPA lower than them, or brag when they got a higher grade than me. I hated the mentality of ""learn just to get a good grade in the exam and then forget about it."" I think it's a dishonor to whoever is paying for your education (either yourself or your parents), to that field of study, to the school, to the instructors, and to their peers. (Ready for a run-on sentence?) Because that type of attitude makes them worse students in their field, which then makes them bad workers, which then makes companies think bad of them, which then makes companies think that people who come from that institute pump out bad workers because they were bad students, which then bites the others in the ass because of the irresponsibility of those idiots who thought it would be easier for them to just fucking memorize to get a good grade. In the end of the day, if this continues, you can't find a job because your school has a bad reputation. I was, no joke, depressed in college and went to therapy for months because everyone around me were pre-health, and I couldn't find people to relate to. 

Now here's the thing: things do get better, and although many say things that annoy me to my soul, not all of them are like that.

First, be a better person than I was. First accept them for who they are. One of the best things that my dad taught me was to accept others for who they are, because, chances are you will never be able to change them. Let's say your SO for example. Your SO will never be exactly who you might want him/her to be, and chances are you will not change him/her. You just need to love them for who they are. 

These annoying kids with their childish attitudes, they are primarily in a shitty situation. They like/love medicine/pharmacy/dentistry. Chances are they don't like science. Now here's my opinion which agrees with hundreds of professors in the world, and you may or may not disagree with, but again, an opinion, right? ;) And you gotta accept people for who and what they think even if it doesn't match with your thoughts. (Ironically, the internet is horrible for that...) Medicine is not science. Engineering is not science. Health is not science. Medicine is medicine. Engineering is engineering. Science is science. They may use certain principles of science, but they're not science. One of the greatest men I met did research in skin grafts and solutions that would keep epithelium alive for dozens of hours, so that organs could be transported over seas in order to be used as transplants. But every time people would ask him why doesn't he do medicine, he'd reply: ""Because I hate medicine."" People who are in science love to learn the nature of things and why/how they work. Arguably, people in medicine/engineering also do the same, but they care more about doing something about a problem than understanding things, which is completely fine! They all may use principles from one another, but they're different things, and people in those fields naturally think differently. These kids who are in love with medicine are in a shitty situation because they're in love with something else, but they have to go through this hurdle of studying science before they can be approved to go to med school. Take your least favorite subject; mine is US history. I would go absolutely bananas if I had to go through 4 years of US history 16h per day just so that one day I could study what I actually love without even knowing if I could get there one day. It doesn't excuse their behaviour, but they are in a shitty fucking situation. On top of that, they may not even realize that they don't like science, probably because they consider medicine and science to be the same thing, so they become conflicted with themselves for hating something that they thought they should be loving. And on top of that, grades are really fucking important for them. This can really go a long way in messing people's minds. When you hate something you think you're ""supposed to love"" and you have to perform well, it can mess with your mind. This applies to other things, like victims in abusive relationships. Even on top of all that, their peers make their respective peers think that if they don't become doctors, there's nothing else that they can be; that either you're a doctor or you're not going to be successful. It's a pretty nasty and non-supportive community in my opinion. I say this because it's good for you to understand why they are the way that they are. I hated the pre-med student attitude, but, still, many of my best friends are in medicine. 

Second, it's not impossible to find people who love chemistry. Trust me, I was in the same shoes as you were, and I remember like it was yesterday how frustrating it was. I don't know where do you go or how big is your school, but not every person in [blank] major is that way. I was a biochem major, and me and a number of my friends in biochem were not like that. Finding someone who is in love with what they're studying is not impossible. It might seem like it when you're surrounded by pre-health students, but it's not impossible. It did take me maybe until my junior year to find those people, but you'll find them. This is what happened to work for me. 

1. Accept them for who they are. You will not change their situation, and chances are they won't be able to change themselves because of the pressure they're put in. I know a number of people who completely changed because of the pressure they had to get into med school. It's like trying to fight gravity, you know? But it's ok! It's fine to change! It's fine to not like what you're doing just so that you can get where you really want to be. It brings a bad aura around you, but it's fine! 

1. Once I accepted them for who they were, that really brought some sort of peace in me. And allowed me to be outgoing and saying: ""Hey! Nice to meet you! We've been sitting next to each other for the past 5 lectures! I'd love to check answers with this assignment. Would you be interested in working together in this?"" If they were pre-health who hates the world, that's fine! I least I meet someone new, and chances are he/she bring some of his/her friends. And then they bring their friends. This way, I got to meet a lot of people. I met a lot of shitty people, but some of those ended up becoming some of my best friends in college. 

Third. As some have said, you don't have to only be friends with people in your major. Yes, it'd be great to have connections and friends in your major so that you're not feeling fucking lonely all the time (I know how it feels because I felt the same way) and you make friends for life in your field, but you're not restricted to that. Clubs are great for that. I joined dancing clubs for example. I'm really into music, so I'd join orchestras or music groups. There are board games clubs. International clubs. CHEMISTRY CLUBBBB!! Chances are you make great friends there, and those friends know people in your major who may be going through the same thing as you. 

Fourth. You're a junior! Yay! You know stuff! Go do research with a prof. It's a lot of fun, and you'll get to meet people who are truly passionate about the field. Yes, pre-meds are obviously going to look for those positions, but write a good cover letter when applying. Say that you're interested in being around like-minded people. You're in chemistry, so there are some really fucking cool labs you can join that the pre-meds won't be at, like electrochem labs, spectroscopy labs, environmental labs, material science labs, etc. If you want some advice on it, let me know!

Look. Let me restate you some facts that you already know. Life sucks right now. You are in a lonely situation. People around you are so negative all the time that it makes you not want to be around them. This negativity makes you feel negative, but you also know that people don't want to be around a negative person. Finding someone who loves the same thing you're studying is improbable but not impossible. No one but you will facilitate you finding those people.

Dude or dudette. Things will get better. It's been 5 years since I finished college. Things will get better. And seriously dude or dudette, if you wish someone to talk to, feel free to DM me ;) 

PS: Again, I was a biochem major in college. I'm sorry that the pre-med students in your school go for biochem and have that type of negative attitude. That just brings a bad name for all of us, man, and I'm sorry. As I said, me and a number of my friends were not like that. At the same time, a number of my peers were like that. People in [blank] field with a bad attitude will always reinforce a stereotype, whether is good or bad. I just hope you understand that not all of us in biochem are like that, just like not all pre-med students are like that (even if many are), and if people in my field brought some negativity in your life, I'm really sorry for that.",3,2020-04-25 03:03:37,chemistry

6924,g7o4os,How to increase Freeze Dryer Capacity?," This question is about Food but related to equipment used in Chemistry Labs.

I  tried chicken dumplings last week from Mountain House and was amazed  how well they tasted. Was super interested to know it can last 25 years.  Then I saw home use freeze dryers from harvest right. I loved the idea  of freeze drying my own food but was disappointed when I figured out how  little food can be freeze in one long batch. Don't get me wrong it is  still an amazing machine and useful for many people. I just think it  would be so much more useful if it had more capacity,  Considering each  batch takes approx. 24+ hours and electricity to run, I  wonder what  would it take to have more.

If  someone working in his field or uses freeze dryer at some labs, can you  please elaborate. I would very much like your input and get me to right  direction.

Following parameters come to my mind, let me know if I missed something or thinking correctly:

1. Drying  Chamber Size - What are the effects of using bigger container? Can I  have more food trays with same setup? Or it needs bigger/more powerful  pump?
2. Vacuum  Pump Capacity - So one is CFM rating which is speed at which it sucks  air out. And then there is ultimate vacuum level (in units of pressure)  it can achieve. Is it also rated for how big of container it can create  that vacuum? Or it can do same job but just needs more time?
3. Time: Are there any methods by which we can reduce this required time? Which may need another equipment, might be worth it.
4. Amount  of food: As suggested by the company, food needs to be on the trays  under a certain thickness and there is also a weight limitation. So what  happens if I have more food or thicker layer of food. Even going  further - Can we have a platform where instead of food staying  stationary on a flat surface, it is instead mixed or moved by some  contraption so all the food gets to surface turn by turn and gets freeze  dried.

Thank you for  reading and welcome other inputs as well. Let me know if you were  thinking something similar. Sorry if my grammar is not proper, English  is not my first language.",2,2020-04-25 00:23:14,chemistry

First, I am working on some compound conversion R&amp;D and am curious about recommended methods to quench rxn.  Is there a database where I can see common chemicals used to quench various catalysts and reagents?  

More specifically I am working with some Zinc Chloride.  One source recommended quench with distilled water saturated with NaHCO3 (6% literature value).  I have reviously attempted the rxn I am currently working on with Iodine instead of zinc and I quenched with sodium thiosulfate.  When pondering this I realized I didn't know why/when to use one vs another vs a third....

I have a plant genetics degree and a fair bit of lab experience through Ochem and Achem at university as well as a full lab with fume hoods, HPLC for analysis, and all the proper labware fwiw.

Second question is regarding LLE. All washes after quench using pH adjusted supersaturated NaCl brine.

Workup currently is quench &gt; pH 10/11 wash x 2 &gt; pH 3/4 wash x 2 &gt;pH 7 wash 2 x &gt; add more desiccant &gt; chromotography &gt; solvent removal &gt; distillation &gt; final product

Obviously my quench question above pertains to this, but what is level of requirement for the brine.  I have seen several sources stating they use a 5% wt/volume ratio for their acid and basic wash, but speak nothing of brine.....

So I was curious if there is an easier way or a shortcut to get appropriate brine without having to supersaturate with NaCl by boiling, and then cooling, then pH adjusting prior.to use.  I plan on scaling this reaction soon and making brine by the 55g drum doesn't sound appealing.

The remaining water wouldn't need to be potable, just clear and non odor-emitting. 

I know one way might be mechanical. If you used baffles to make very still areas of the water, the darker liquid will sink (guessing that's the urea). I don't know if the odor is predominantly from ammonia, but if it is, is there a simple way to separate it, preferably without the use of consumable media? Ideally if there were a way to use a current or RF signal to isolate and siphon it off, that energy could be obtained from a renewable source like solar and no waste would be produced.

Background: The problem with Ascorbic Acid powder is that it isn't as well absorbed in that raw form as ascorbate forms.

My motivation to put AA in sparkling water was because I had previously dissolved AA in sodium bicarbonate which gave me beneficial sodium ascorbate to consume.

I thought the fact that AA dissolved in sparkling water made it more absorbable since AA dissolves in sodium bicarbonate in the same manner. But then again sparkling water has carbonic acid in it so I wonder if that rendered the AA useless.

This material has the ability to act as a hydrogen peroxide detector, which we highlight discussion of in the video, as well as a supercapacitor, due to the pseudocapacitive properties of the manganese dioxide! 

Anyway, we are now competing against other groups at our school for monetary prizes. Prizes will go to the groups with the most likes on their YouTube videos, so if you all could go and give our video a watch and like, I would greatly appreciate it! 

I know this isn't really a display of chemistry, or an experiment. However, the basis of our design relies heavily on the chemical and physical properties of the graphene and manganese dioxide, so I think it fits.

7033,g6nt94,Just exactly how acutely dangerous is NO2?,"I've been running a lot of reactions that produce NO2 lately, some more than others. I don't have a fume hood but I do them all outdoors well away from my home, typically with a fan blowing the fumes away from me. I have a respirator with P95 cartridges but I'm fairly certain it's insufficient for NO2 and more designed for organic solvents, etc.

I feel that I have a decent nose for NO2 and I can readily pick up on small quantities in the air, in which case I always stop breathing immediately and take a few steps away to huff some fresh air, but over the past few days I have gotten a few good whiffs of NO2 by accident. I haven't experienced any symptoms such as burning airways, coughing, heavy mucous production, etc but I kinda got in my own head last night a few hours after breathing a little NO2 and started worrying about the potential effects.

From what I've read, there's not really a ""treatment"" for acute NO2 exposure besides fresh air and supportive care if patients are hypoxic or experiencing respiratory issues. So I guess what I'm asking is: How dangerous is a brief but strong whiff of NO2? Are the effects primarily limited to the respiratory tract, or would one assume that NO2 exposure would have possible systemic effects?

Finally, I've found some mixed sources claiming that bubbling the NO2 through an NaOH solution will dramatically reduce how much total NO2 escapes the reaction - what's an appropriate concentration of NaOH to use for this?",18,2020-04-23 09:39:25,chemistry

It says that at low temperature, the platinum surface is poisoned by CO, which is strongly bonded by retro donation (retro coordination) to the platinum, and that a high enough temperature must be reached to break the bond and thus desorb the CO. My question is: does O2, which is also present in the air, form much weaker bonds with platinum, and therefore CO has an advantage? Does O2 back-bond with platinum?

7038,g6lo59,HHO generator flashback bubbler,"I’ve made an electrolytic cell before, and in this upcoming model I had never needed a flashback arrestor, bubbler or anything of the sort. but now, if my next design works as efficiently as I estimate that it will, then I might try lighting the output.

before you start loosing your minds telling me that it will blow up right away because I’ll have hydrogen and oxygen in a perfect ratio to blow up in my face, you should know that my design keeps the gasses separate. the electrodes and therefore the gasses are in separate containers and I get a vacuum in my hydrogen compartment before turning it on to remove any air.

Even still I hesitate to light a hydrogen generator on fire, so I’m wondering if I should make a bubbler so that if perhaps there’s a leak and there is oxygen in my hydrogen, it doesn’t backflash and blow my house up. After all I did optimistically name it NavBumba (not bomb) for a reason. 

In the electrolytic cell I’m using right now, I have had no issues with impurities, I’ve had this thing full of hydrogen for weeks. When I come back, collect some hydrogen in a syringe, and light it, it burns slowly as I push it out of the syringe. In contrast to that it explodes when I put air in it with the hydrogen.

As far as how much hydrogen I will be dealing with in my next design it would probably be up to 0.05g of hydrogen gas, which if you know hydrogen gas, that’s a good bit, about 7 KJ or about 14 firecrackers going off at once in a sealed ~0.5L container",18,2020-04-23 07:23:04,chemistry

HCl 37% will not protonate as efficiently as concentrated sulphuric acid (quantitatively speaking) and I expect the time of reaction to increase.

Detonation velocity is measureable with the right equipment, brisance is easily measured using a steel cylinder and a lead cylinder, but RE factor... how would you measure the destruction ability? Visually? Does someone just look at the difference of the damage of one pound of TNT vs one pound of PETN and just says ehhhh it's 1.66 ish. I highly doubt it.

Naturally having these interests my parents bought me a store bought chemistry set (I would guess late 80s). I did lots of the experiments in the booklet provided and was entertained for a while. One afternoon I was messing with the set. After doing a few of the experiments I dumped the chemical mixture into the toilet and flushed it. As soon as the water was agitated it started glowing a bright greenish blue. I was shocked and amazed and certainly one of those life moments forever seared into your memory bank. For months I tried to recreate this phenomenon with to no avail. Needless to say dumping tons of chemicals I didn't understand into the toilet, flushing, and praying it would glow so I could impress my siblings. It never happened again. To this day I still wonder what the heck I made and how did I accomplish this accidentally. 

Coincidentally enough my mother was working for for company that originally developed the chemical for glow sticks. I remember during a bring your child to work day (when they was a social norm) that we went to one of the labs and they made a huge container of the glowing liquid that seemed to nearly light up the whole lab with the lights off. It was always a running joke that the one employees young son did the same thing accidentally in the toilet meanwhile they are spending tons of time and research on it.

At neutral pH all steps are reversible, so the more stable trans fused system is the only product.

At very acidic pH, the [3+2] is irreversible so two isomers are formed.

The trans isomer cannot get orbital overlap to form the 4 membered ring, so a hydrogen transfer occurs instead. Both product are irreversibly formed in their final step.

Valid at the equivalence point:

Suppose you titrate 20.00 ml H2SO4 with 11.00 ml NaOH. What is then the actual molarity of the sulfuric acid (in mmol / ml)?

molarity = n / V

V H2SO4 = 20.00 mL

How do i find n?

n NaOH = m x V

= 1 x 11 = 11 moles

and then 2x #mmol H2SO4 = 1x #mmol NaOH

I pretty quickly remembered that I shouldn’t mix bleach with other chemicals but didn’t immediately realize how serious it was to not. I flushed the toilet a few times and wiped the bowl with the rag, and I’m not sure if it was mixed in the bowl or mixed by my scrubbing, but multiple times over the course of 3-4 hours I had to leave the bathroom for a minute or so at a time to stand by the window for fresh air. I would be okay for 20 minutes at a time or so, then would have really intense burning and itching in my throat and eyes and nose. I was coughing and sneezing and my eyes were watering too bad to even open, but after getting fresh air and recovering I continued to ignore my bodies warning signs and kept going into the closed bathroom with the irritating chemicals. I probably had to leave for fresh air about 5 times in 3 hours until eventually it started burning so badly that I couldn’t be in at all anymore. I stopped cleaning the bathroom before I was finished because I could not handle it anymore. 

When I left the bathroom I was coughing, sneezing, runny nose and eyes, eyes burning too bad to open, wheezing and chest pain. I opened all the windows and stood by one for a few minutes to get some air. My symptoms have subsided a lot, but I’ve been out of the bathroom with the windows open for over an hour now and still have pain and tightness in my chest and slightly irritated and stuffy nose. The stuffiness is barely noticeable now, but the chest pain and tightness doesn’t seem to be letting up. This could be the anxiety I’ve given myself though, haha. I am not coughing as bad but am concerned by the chest pain and the fact that I sat in there exposed for so long. 

Is there any possibility of harm being done to my health from this? Is there anything I need to do? How long do I need to keep my windows open?

7158,g5np8h,Evaporation rate of glycerine and/or propylene glycol? (Re: residue from fog machines.),"Hi!

I need to do some smoke testing to aid in leak-testing a free-reed instrument (a [melodica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodica).) Dry ice works great but due to local availability and other issues I've been seeking a replacement.

I know that glycerine and propylene glycol-based smokes leave no residue of concern for most cases, but there is a special consideration here: the slightest change to the mass on the vibrating tines affects the tuning of the instrument. For example, even a slight condensed humidity from the player's breath drops the pitch of the reeds, so I want to avoid anything that will leave any residue.

For this reason I have been hesitant to use the aforementioned smoke sources out of a concern that they would deposit a fine residue on the reeds. (I'm not concerned about the rest of the instrument.)

I've been trying to find out if either of those chemicals will ever evaporate. My understanding is that they are resistant to evaporation (e.g. glycerine apparently [having a vapor pressure](http://www.aciscience.org/docs/physical_properties_of_glycerine_and_its_solutions.pdf) on the order of .0001 to .001mmHg at room temperature -- which is 0.0133 Pa to 0.133 Pa if my understanding is correct) but I can't seem to figure out what that means for me: for example, if the residue evaporates in a few hours or days, that's fine with me. If it's going to take months, or will never happen, that's a deal-breaker.

It's not possible to clean the reeds afterwards as one side of them is inaccessible. If there was a simple cleaning agent (e.g. soap?) it might be possible to submerge the instrument in some kind of bath for the sake of cleaning, but I'd very much like to avoid that.

Anyone have any guidance here? If there are alternative smoke sources, e.g. those that leave truly no, or truly negligible, residue, I'd love to hear about them. I'm currently investigating ultrasonic mist/fog machines... possibly a large model might make enough fog to be useful. (The ""smoke"" doesn't have to linger long, just a second or two while it's blown through the instrument.)

Or maybe I'm worrying needlessly about the glycerine/PG residue?

I’m looking for any suggestions regarding CO2 sensors / analysers for combustion gases measurements (small experimental boiler for coal and biomass, temperature of analysed flue-gas is around 200 - 300°C, expected amount of CO2 is approx. 9 - 14 %).

The problem with CO2 is that it can’t be easily measured. Carbon dioxide oxidation degree reaches the highest value, so not many other options than non-dispersive infrared absorption comes to my mind. All of these systems based on IR spectroscopy are extremely pricy with respect to our financial capacity. As far as I know and based on what I’ve found, there are most-likely no other options industrially used for CO2 continuous measuring.  

Do you have any experiences which analyser up to $1500 may be suitable (decent accuracy and response - its output will be sent to the datalogger A/D input).

7188,g5fqsi,"Accelerating the curing of ""drying oils"" (tung oil, linseed oil)","Afternoon all. I have an interest in woodworking. Two of the finishes often used are so called ""drying oils"", which are actually curing oils. From my crude understanding they're some kind of polymerisation reaction based on oxidation of the oils, but I'm very much not a chemist.

I was hoping someone here with experience with such reactions, or an interest in doing some thought exercises or research for their own gratification (and thereby my benefit!), could have a think about how these reactions could be best accelerated, and how much of an impact those methods would have. My thoughts on the situation, which I'd love to be corrected on:

&amp;#x200B;

* Increase the oxygen concentration around the wood. This would, in my engineer's mind, increase the concentration gradient and help it diffuse faster into the wood. Downsides...well, high concentration oxygen is pretty unfriendly. Especially around oils that exothermically cure. So this isn't one I plan to try. But hypothetically, how much would increasing the oxygen concentration by e.g. 10%-20% (i.e. seal it in a chamber and displace some air with oxygen) increase the speed of the reaction?
* Increase the temperature. Again, how much increase in rate could be expected for what I guess is a diffusion-limited reaction from a 10 degree or 20 degree celcius increase in temperature?
* Increase the airflow. Forced-air convection over the part would avoid a boundary layer with reduced oxygen content from forming near the surface, but I have no idea how likely it is that a boundary with a noticably lower O2 content would form. Is this likely to make a difference?
* UV light. There seem to be conflicting reports about whether UV is likely to accelerate this reaction or not; any input from those more knowledgeable? If UV is a factor, would UV-B be more effective due to its higher energy, or is it more of an absorption band thing where you have to tailor the frequency to the specific reaction?

Okay, that's my long-winded musing over. If anyone has any thoughts, I'd love to hear them!",12,2020-04-21 09:01:20,chemistry

7208,g5b7vx,"Accidentally poured ""phenyl"" disinfectant on my plate. What to do?","
We're supposed to wash our own stainless steel plates at the mess I eat due to the lockdown. They fill up some random plastic bottles with soap solution which we use to wash our plates. Someone left a 7UP bottle filled with a viscous, greenish liquid which I accidentally poured onto my plate. The workers say that liquid is 'phenyl' and they use it to clean toilets. I did not study chemistry at school, but I assume they probably meant a phenol-based disinfectant, which is toxic to humans iirc.

I washed that liquid off with running water, and then washed the plate for a few minutes with the soap solution they provided. Since there's a shortage of plates, I can't get a new one. 

Can I still use that plate to eat food? If not, are there any ways in which I can remove the traces of the disinfectant?

7257,g4tgfp,[2020/04/20] Synthetic Challenge #129,"**Intro**

Hello everyone, welcome back to Week 125 of Synthetic Challenge!! This week I decided to do something a little bit different. Rather than go down the ""make me this thing"" route I'm going to do two different things, we're going to do an inorganic synthetic relay and you're also getting a target type of compound.

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

For the synthetic relay, we'll keep the rules nice and simple and stolen from the normal synthetic relay :)

1. For each user in the relay, they can post once every **3** posts

2. Upper limit of 10 carbons for every relay segment

And one special addition: Not a rule but a suggestion, try and make what you're adding helpful to creating a species that you'd call in organic.  

For practical rules: I will post two replies to this, one with the first relay starting material and the other will be the second. 

Keep it in a chain of comments so it is easy to follow. Branching is allowed only if two people post within 2 minutes of each other.

**Products**

The two relay starting materials will be in the replies to this; but I promised a target of some type as well.

So I would like you to propose **a route to a low valent main group species.** 

That is it! Nice and simple no?

For those of you who have been doing these for a long time hopefully you've build up enough knowledge of random inorganic things to give me some suggestions. For others, go do some reading! We all have plenty of time now :)",8,2020-04-20 09:09:57,chemistry

7292,g4il1h,Hoping to create a scopolamine tincture from patches,"I am trying to treat my depression/anxiety with scopolamine. I have Transderom Scop patches for motion sickness prescribed to me that seem to work about 50% of the time. They either make the depression disappear in about 15 minutes or they don't work at all - even if worn for 3 days. There is a 0.5 mg loading dose they release rapidly initially, and I think rapid release must be a key to the antidepressant effect. In the clinical trials for depression, scopolamine was administered intravenously at 4 micrograms per kg which would be about 0.25 mg for me. ( [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334071](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23334071) )

So I hope to extract the 1.5 mg from each patch into a tincture so I can get 6 doses from each patch. I would take it sublingual for rapidity. The patches contain light mineral oil. I thought I might drop the patches into a liquid that would hopefully extract the mineral oil and scopolamine.

Could we have some sort of a pinned thread for questions about cleaning supplies and disinfectants? I very much respect those who come here asking about things they aren't sure about (mixing cleaners, making homemade cleaners/disinfectants, etc.). They're wise enough to recognize that they might not know a lot about chemistry and turn to others for advice, saving themselves time, money, or even injury.

However, I also see many of the same questions being asked all the time. I think it would be helpful for many of those people to have a single place where they can ask their questions and get them answered. Some of these things being:

* Can I mix (any permutation of bleach, ammonia cleaner, hydrogen peroxide, vinegar, rubbing alcohol, etc.)
   * Generally not. Mixing bleach with many other cleaning products could generate toxic fumes or substances. The amount produced is not going to kill you instantly or anything, but it's still not a great idea. Some other combinations might not be overtly dangerous, but mixing cleaning supplies together won't give a ""better cleaner/disinfectant"" unless *explicitly stated*.
* How can I make my own rubbing alcohol/disinfectant?
   * Synthesizing rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) from other chemicals is very, very difficult unless you have a university-style laboratory or some kind of chemical manufacturing plant. You could hurt yourself in the process, and even if you knew what you were doing and had the proper equipment, it wouldn't be cost effective. It's going to be much cheaper to buy a bottle of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol (drinking alcohol), even at marked-up prices. Around 70% is best for disinfecting purposes.

There are others, but these are some I see very often. I hope everyone is staying safe, and thank you to all those who are interested in the chemistry behind some of the things we work with every day!",15,2020-04-18 15:24:33,chemistry

I'm an undergraduate chemistry major. We've talked about climate change in class many times, detailing the science of how and why it happens, but I can't seem to explain the science well enough to them to convince them. So, I thought...why not just *show* them?

CO2(g) and H2O(g) are easy enough to obtain. But how do I design an experiment that shows how they can affect temperature...and convince them that there's nothing else at play? I can't use an opaque bowl to trap the gases, as then there's no light to create the effect. But I can't use a glass bowl, either, since they'll just say that it's a regular greenhouse and it doesn't prove anything about the gases' addition (unless the rate at which temperature changes increases as more gases are pumped into the system?).

7422,g3041z,"PVB and epoxy resin systems, I have a textile coated in PVB, need to laminate it with or without the PVB.","I am making a historical looking suit of armor using a scale design for sport combat and personal defence (The design is wonky, it's gonna hang on an armor stand, all in one piece but modular for mobility considerations and have removable ballistic plates for torso protection) . I am preferring modern textiles in addition to the leather/stainless/wool/silk for the lining and look. For that purpose I have chosen UHMWPE and Kevlar, but one of the kevlar products I ordered came with a PVB liner and I have some questions about what I can do to produce these scales. Either by removing the liner or incorporating the liner.

Yesterday I did a few experiments:

&amp;#x200B;

I squeezed 5 layers in a vice between stainless plates and torched it gently and it seemed to set the PVB properly as it is near impossible to tear the laminates apart without pliers and some leverage.

&amp;#x200B;

I used a 2 part, 2:1 ratio, epoxy resin and attempted to laminate the fibers without removing the PVB. The ambient temperature was too cold and it has not cured yet but seems to adhere after some prolonged application of pressure.

&amp;#x200B;

I soaked a fair bit of EtOH into a single 3""x3"" square of the PVB coated kevlar-29, folded it over once on itself, and pressed that in the vice between two stainless plates, under light heating from a torch that did not exceed 250f. The ethanol did soften the PVB but did little else and there was no adhesion between layers.

&amp;#x200B;

Soaking the square in a bath of room temperature EtOH for several hours allowed the PVB to incorporate fully into the kevlar-29 fibers but then laminating by thermosetting doesn't seem possible after looking at it but it might if you squeeze it to get the hot PVB back out. Could I subsequently laminate with an epoxy resin solution for ballistic properties near the same performance level as the known industrial procedure?

&amp;#x200B;

Today, I am going to try to hot press 5-layer squares using two mild steel plates, a bench vice, hand torch, and IR thermometer, as in industry, the PVB is pressed in a mold at 400-500psi and an elevated temperature (the exact value escapes me at the moment). I am not trying to reach the same ballistic protection as a professional process, just enough to make some nice armor scales I can lacquer that approach similar levels of protection, that look similar to flax or linen.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I need a mirror finish on the mild steel plates? Can I use silicone lubricant spray to hot press these kevlar-29 layers together?

It also has 200pm max. methanol, 10ppm max acetaldehyde and acetal, and 200ppm of total other impurities, per the website. There is also 'food grade' ethanol that's also 200 proof and must carry some of these same concerns?

If I use it to make a tincture I will put the mushrooms in a jar and submerge them in ethanol, shake it up and wait a while, and then strain. I'll then let a good amount evaporate off till its only a small amount of solution left. The idea is to only take a ml or less at a time.

7538,g24fcj,Molecular/ion dimensions calculation,"Sup,   


I started working on electric double-layer capacitors like a year ago (new phd stud here). I was mainly focused on hybrids which combine battery and capacitor part into one device. My thesis was regarded to capacitor part and its active material matching to organic electrolyte - huge amount of variables which is not connected to my post. Long story short, during my internship I started some simple modeling of the electrolyte ions. By using Avogadro program it is possible to optimise structure and generate the van der Waals sphere. Later, for the electrostatic potential mapping I used the Jmol, which is also the program for the graphical modeling. Although, I want to calculate the dimensions of the ions with the van der Waals sphere on. Is it possible to do it in these programs? Or are there any programs which will alows to do it? Im also concerned about the potential mapping as the authors of the Jmol said that it is only partial potentials of the atoms not ions nor molecules. I heard something about Gaussian program or the Gamess, although Im not sure if they are useful since I want to dermine the dimension of the ions not the quantum chemistry variables.

So I work in a chemical plant where we use potassium carbonate as a binder to stop the reaction.... 
our potassium carbonate is sent to the reactor via pipes from a pressurize vessel in which the K2Co3 is mixed with water. 
We believe this pipes and vessels might have significant potassium carbonate build up from deposition that it is slowing the flow.

Does anyone here know what would be a good  way to get rid of this deposit/build up?
We have tried water, but it seems to be doing little.
Does anyone here know if maybe vinegar, diesel or baking soda might work?

7551,g1ztxo,Spectral Data Questions (from a stats student),"As a statistics student who is going to be doing some applied statistics research using metabolomics, I have to work with MS data. I took introductory chemistry and biochem 3 years ago... but we never went into how to use MS data for analysis (and nothing on NMR). I have a few questions I hope this community can help with. I find it's hard to discover simplified material that answers my specific questions while also being understandable.

1. Does a larger peak area in MS data mean there is a higher concentration of the metabolite? How about for NMR data? Is there even a difference in what the data from NMR and MS is telling you?
2. If you have a standard solutions made for a known metabolite that means the peak area generated for that metabolite can be converted to a concentration (this is my understanding, please roast me if I'm wrong). Let's say you have some metabolites with a known standard solutions that can be converted to concentration. Then you have some that don't have standard solutions and are left as peak area. Traditionally, a statistics education would says to simply standardize (subtract mean and divide by the standard error) each metabolite to make things no longer on unit scale. However, I'm not sure if that makes sense for peak area data as I'm not sure what a larger peak area value means. I assume this okay as you can think of the peak area as just some continuous value so I don't see why everything couldn't just be standardized and then analyzed.
3. Any general tips on how to pre-process metabolites before analyzing it when no standard solution is available? Even textbooks you'd recommend?

7554,g1ywuj,Suggestions on learning methodology for an adult learner,"TL:DR At the bottom. 

Recently, I've rediscovered my interest in chemistry which I foolishly -or ""thankfully"" considering the state of the job market- ignored when I was young and able to act upon it. So I decided I'll be dedicating a couple of hours every weekend and study an introductory chemistry textbook that I picked up. Slowly but surely I was faced with the effects that age and distance from an academic environment have had on my ability to learn and retain information. 

Things don't stick, my ability to take notes has dwindled to the extent that in order to ""take notes"" I have to paraphrase the entirety of the page, making the process arduous, tiring and not very efficient. Any of you guys have any studying tips for an adult learner? Any resources that might help me remember how to learn, or even your own thoughts and opinions about how such a task could be tackled?

I know that chemistry is very lab-dependent, and I'm not operating under the illusion that I'll be able to sit down and make syntheses, distillations and what not. I just want to delve into the theoretical aspect. Seeing ""C9H18"" and being able to say ""Ah, dimethylcycloheptane"" after the 20 minutes it takes me to figure it out (dunno if this is even right btw. I just googled.) Seeing the word ""polymerisation"" and understanding what it means in a bit more depth than I do now. In short, I know I won't be a chemist by going through a couple of textbooks, and it's not what I'm trying to achieve anyway. I just want to engage with, and understand as much of the theory as my free time and circumstances allow. 

TL;DR Old dude remembered he liked chemistry when he was young, so he thought he should study it again and have fun. Old dude figured out that he has forgotten how to learn. Ideas on studying methodology? General opinions about how to tackle this? Halp?",10,2020-04-15 14:29:44,chemistry

I have equation (1.1) shown below that is applicable to isothermal conditions only. I'm trying to apply this equation to non-isothermal conditions. It means that I can predict the evolution of log(G\*) from equation (1.1) for any duration at a single temperature. However, what I have is an hourly temperature history that I'd like to use to predict the evolution of log(G\*). This is where I got lost.

What I did was derive equation (1.4) from equation (1.1) hoping that I can use it to get the slope at every time-step, such that at each time-step, I would have a different temperature. However, as you can see in equation (1.4), I have the time t appearing in the exponential. Should I be using the total time up to the point of interest? Or is it the time that's back-calculated from equation (1.3) for that specific temperature? Are there other ways of doing this calculation?

Thanks!

I'm currently in undergraduate studying Chemistry, but I already know I want to continue studying it in graduate school. I've thought long and hard about this; I know I'll enjoy research because I've been working in a lab at my university and it hasn't gotten dull even with the repetitive reaction sequence I run. I also love to read random publications for fun to learn about the deeper chemistry, so that doesn't seem like a task at all. I am aware of the work that needs to be put in, but I'd rather that than not be challenged.

My problem lies in what area of chemistry to focus on in graduate school. I've only taken gen chem, analytical chem, and organic chem so far, so I still need to take pchem, biochem, and inorganic. However, the only one that's stuck out as what I *don't* want to do is analytical.

7578,g1oazc,"A follow-up to a post I made about a Youtube channel for ""everything about organic chemistry""","I made a post two days ago about starting a Youtube channel dedicated solely to organic chemistry. Here's a link to the specific post that goes into further detail about this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/g0gir5/thinking\_about\_starting\_a\_youtube\_video\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/g0gir5/thinking_about_starting_a_youtube_video_for/)

I wanted to make a second post discussing the feedback I received from that post and my actions going forward with this.

I was up very late Monday night contemplating on what I wanted to do with my life, and the idea of making Organic Chemistry-related content on Youtube crossed my mind again, and I decided to post just to share my thoughts with others. I NEVER would have expected to receive so much upvotes and comments on my post. It's still mind-blowing to me, and in a way, kind of life-changing.

I want to first thank all of you for your positive reception and feedback. Becoming a Youtube part-time is something I was always interested in and doing this type of content would be very fun. The positive reception I received has breathed new life into making this a reality, and it has given me the motivation to do so.

First, it may take some time (estimate 3-4 weeks, but **subject to change**) to put out my first video. For the upcoming weeks I will be busy completing my current internship. Also, I'm fairly new to making videos and, rather than rushing something, I want to put in a lot of effort to make sure that I produce something that's high quality.

* I'm going to invest in a decent microphone (if any of you have suggestions do let me know).
* In terms of how I'm going to record content, I've been thinking of using Manim (it's the stuff that 3b1b uses for his videos). A while back, someone on this subreddit posted a modified version of Manim called Chanim for use with chemistry-related content. I'm in the process of having that installed on my laptop and learning how to utilize it. Hopefully my laptop is decent enough where I can produce a smooth video.

I don't want to lose any of your guys' interests regarding this, so I do plan on giving some updates as to the progress I've made. I do have a Youtube channel I made a couple of months ago but haven't touched since: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-GI0e2HT-IRFropwzZogTQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-GI0e2HT-IRFropwzZogTQ). I currently have the name of the channel as ""Walter Brown"" (which is a joke on Walter White from Breaking Bad). I'm open to any name suggestions, but I do feel comfortable adopting some sort of alias rather than having to use my own personal name.

If you'd like to receive updates from me about this, I **highly recommend** you either **subscribe** to my Youtube channel, and/or **follow me on Reddit.** It will be easier for me to make posts and connect with you guys more. I could also make posts to this subreddit, but I want to limit how much I post to allow for everyone else to post about other chemistry-related things.

If you guys have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out to me! I love talking with people and I'm open to learning more about you and how I can make this work for everyone. Thanks!",21,2020-04-15 03:55:40,chemistry

7599,g1gwdo,Producing stable Hypochlorous Acid (HOCL) disinfectant,"Hello all. I am exploring the process of producing Hypochlorous Acid (HOCL) from salt water and electrolysis for disinfectant purposes. I know there are other methods of producing HOCL, but this is the process I am trying to figure out. When the water PH is maintained more on the Acidic side, between 5-7 PH, the main form of the free chlorine in the water is HOCL. The main issue is that when you split a salt molecule (NaCL) through electrolysis you get two substances Hypochlorous Acid (HOCL) and Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) that are trying to find equilibrium so the HOCL is unstable. I am wondering if it would be possible to pass the substance through a ion-exchange membrane or filter to produce a stable solution that only contains HOCL. If so what type of membrane/filter would work for this? Here are some resources from my research.

7673,g0s4ns,Suggestions on things to read/study to better prime me for organic chemistry coursework?,"Hey all,

I'm an adult student currently nearing completion of a BS in biology. One thing I have put off until now is the chemistry coursework, and I will be taking Organic Chem 1 in the fall, followed by part two in my final semester. Thus far I have done well in my first two undergrad chem courses, really only struggling with some of the math since I don't study. Conceptually, I'm ahead of most of the class. 

My concern is that up until this point I have been succeeding primarily due to being a lifelong science enthusiast. I'm an avid reader and hobbyist chemist, as well as a very advanced hobbyist pyrotechnician. While I have learned a lot in my first two chem courses, much of it felt more like connecting the dots than learning fresh concepts since I already had a strong foundation of the basics (even some more complex chemistry concepts). I fear that I have been coasting a bit up until this point, and as I mentioned I don't really study at all so I miss a few math-heavy problems on every test. My lab and homework/participation points are always very high though so I still get A's.

I'm looking for some guidance as to what sorts of literature or concepts I can begin looking over now to build up my knowledge base before Organic Chemistry. I hear a lot of horror stories and while I am a high-GPA student, I am not a *good* student. It would help me greatly to know that I'm going into organic with a decent foundation so that if my study habits get the best of me I still pass the courses.

Any suggestions on anything at all would be appreciated, and I'm talking everything from academic papers to Wikipedia articles to novels. Even just a few bullet points of major concepts that I can individually research would be helpful since essentially I have no idea what to expect beyond ""the next step in chemistry"". Should I memorize all the functional groups I can? Study molecular structure? That sort of thing.

Water chemistry comes into play a lot and I wanted to do some research/ produce content to expand on this and dive into how some cleaners can be used as disinfectants, or at least give folks some more background on what they're using and the processes involved. For many oxidants like chlorine bleach, ORP (oxidation reduction potential) can be used as a measure of effectiveness for oxidants in disinfection or as an analog to concentration for control purposes.

When testing using a solution which had sodium percarbonate added to it (assumed that H2O2 would be generated), I noticed that ORP decreased. Given that pH wildly changed with this addition I thought that the changing conditions may have more to do with this than, however further reading seems to indicate that H2O2 reduced the ORP, this was confirmed by adding a small amount of 3% H2O2 to the same water, however my reading did not form a conclusion on why ORP decreased.

I was hoping to use ORP as an indication of H2O2 formation using the percarbonate, but now I'm curious as to what is being observed. Does free radical formation not impact the ORP reading?

7690,g0lkou,Using Microcapillary Pipets - Advice Appreciated!,"I feel like a dummy for asking this, but I've been Googling for an hour and can't find anything helpful.

tldr: Can someone tell me more about microcapillary pipets, how exactly they're used, and whether they'd be a reasonable replacement for mechanical micropipetters? 

I work in a biology teaching lab at a university (I'm a chemist by training) and we're trying to figure out what experiments we can have students do from home both over the summer (outreach for high schoolers) and possibly in the fall (if we're forced to continue remote learning). One of our biggest issues is micropipetters, since most of the kits I can find require them. However, I recently remembered that we have a boatload of the disposable, glass capillary tube calibrated pipets in storage, and was thinking that maybe we can finally use them for something. That said, I've NEVER used these, so I'm not quite sure how they work, how well they work, and if they're a reasonable replacement instead of buying every student a 2-20uL pipet. 

Googling has led me nowhere, as every combination of words I search just brings up either the large glass volumetric pipets or mechanical micropipets. I've gathered that you need some type of tube or bulb to dispense the liquid, but that capillary action will do the actual filling of the tube (which is kind of what I figured). Is there anything else I should know about these? Is it a terrible idea to give thin glass rods to (gifted) high schoolers and expect them to not stab themselves? Are these relatively easy to use?

7704,g0gonr,How do oxidizers like hydrogen peroxide strip the oxide layer of copper?,"May sound like a dumb question, but hear me out.
Last year, I had a need for some copper (ii) chloride so following Nurdrage's method, I reacted copper with hydrochloric acid using H2O2 to strip the oxide layer allowing the acid to react with the raw copper. 
Curious about whether or not this worked with all oxidizers, I later tried it with a pinch of potassium chlorate to see what would happen. It worked very well with so much CuCl2 being produced some of it precipitated out of solution! It also produced a bit of potassium chloride which stuck around as an impurity though, so not the cleanest way of doing things. It also produces chlorine gas, but the amount of KClO3 I used was practically nothing and I was in a well ventilated area, so the risk was minimal.

But up until now, I assumed that this worked because it _oxidized_ the oxide layers into elemental copper. 
CuO+H2O2--&gt;Cu+O2+H2O
Using this assumption, I was going to recycle some copper oxide I produced as a waste byproduct into elemental copper, but before doing this I looked up the chemical equation to make sure my assumption was right. Turns out I was way off and it seems that, according to Google, all adding an oxidizer would just reduce CuO to Cu2O. 
H2O2+CuO--&gt;Cu2O+H2O+O2
Even more odd is the Science Madness claims CuO also reacts to form CuCl2, which flies in the face of all my assumptions for how this process works. 
Though I can't seem to find reliable sources for this information, so really I'm not sure which is right.

So what's really going on when I make CuCl? If the latter equation is correct, why does the hydrochloric acid only react with copper in the presence of an oxidizer? 

Bonus question: Is there a way to reduce CuO to elemental copper without using hydrogen at high temperatures? Working with hydrogen in an enclosed space is already a bit out of my comfort zone, so adding heat to it turns my ""no"" into a ""hell no!"" really quick.",4,2020-04-13 05:51:14,chemistry

For the last year I've taken on research as well and fell in love with it.

On Youtube I noticed that the videos made for Organic Chemistry are solely to help people with the undergraduate-level material. But, other than NileRed, I haven't seen videos connecting the concepts of Organic Chemistry to real life applications. I was thinking of doing a Youtube channel where I'd discuss about all the topics covered in an undergraduate Organic Chemistry class but go further with its relevance towards biology/medicine, materials science, environmental science, and other fields. I also want to discuss advanced topics that are covered in graduate level courses and current research that's done in the field.

My goal is to provide a different perspective into the field and subject so the general audience can have more of an appreciation for Organic Chemistry (similar to how individuals like NileRed, Veritasium, 3b1b, etc. have made videos about science), as I strongly feel that Organic Chemistry is still poorly misunderstood and can be presented in a better light.

7728,g092vc,new to botanical extraction &amp; chemistry,"I've got a masters of geology but due to increasing interest and demand in chemistry, I started working in a geochemistry lab after grad school, and now I work in a chemistry lab (environmental and paint/industrial coatings). My hobbies in my spare time include herbalism and cosmetic chemistry. I am enrolling in a cosmetic chemistry course through U of Cincinnati. So that's my background.

So anyway, I have no idea where to start when considering creating botanical extracts of my own. I've created infused oils, but that's about as far as I have gotten. I want to know more about extractions before I start diving in beyond the traditional tincture. However I would like to keep things simple because I don't have much in the way of equipment, but would be willing to invest in some.

I stumbled on a paper which considered the nociceptive effects of wormwood, and they seem to be fairly simple with their extraction but don't offer many details. They use a dilute acetic acid solution for the extraction at room temperature, and subsequently allow it to evaporate off. When administering the extract, they dilute it in saline. Not much detail offered. I have attempted creating the extract, in the same manner, with a stronger acetic acid solution. I used very subtle heat for a couple of hours and let it sit at ambient conditions for another two weeks. I evaporated as much of the solution off as I could, and I am left with a gooey, black, sticky extract but it still smells like vinegar somewhat. So, I am not sure where to go from here, if there are further steps to take or precautions to consider that aren't being mentioned in this paper? Is there a way to get the acetic acid completely out of the extract? 

Also, any books, references, etc. would be appreciated for this newbie. I have the link to the research paper below. Many thanks and cheers!

I have been out of this kind of chemistry for a while and have no access to materials during these times.

So I tested it out by adding a good scoop of NaOH to \~300 mL water, followed by 2 drops of 0.8 % phen. which yields a more pinkish hue (middle on the pic) as we liked. I actually wanted dark red but I would not know how, I can only get the 'permanganate-like' purple colour.

The problem is that the colour fades fast. I would've guessed it was acidification by CO2-&gt;carbonic acid, but adding more base does not change it back. So now I'm wondering whether the phenolph. is degrading? Perhaps its light sensitive? Or is there something obvious that im overlooking..

&amp;#x200B;

I intended on preparing beforehand by havving 2 drops already in \~100 mL of water, so that no one sees us adding any drops in an obvious way, its a surprise and part of sort of a ritual. But now I'm wondering whats happening to the colour and what I can do to make sure it will work;

Regardless, I think that r/chemistry would appreciate the work that I put in writing this. Feel free to share with anyone.

With the novel coronavirus going around, people are getting desperate trying to find newer and better ways to clean. It seems a common mentality is ""if A is a good cleaner and B is a good cleaner, mixing A and B must produce a SUPER cleaner capable of even more."" Just look at the recent TIFUs and you'll see that in the past couple weeks there's been plenty of people mixing bleach and ammonia. Most people know that mixing bleach and ammonia is bad and makes toxic gas, but now new information is circling the internet that mixing bleach and alcohol produces chloroform. Perhaps the best example is in a [new TIFU post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fz4t5g/tifu_by_accidentally_making_chloroform/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). Some people are in disbelief while others are accusing OP of sharing the recipe for chloroform. I hope to clear a couple things up in this post. 

**1. First off, it is never a good idea to mix household products unless instructed to do so.** The combination of A and B is not usually a better cleaner. In fact it is often worse because of unintended chemical reactions, such as the mixture of bleach and ammonia which produces toxic chloramine. Even if your reaction doesn't produce toxic products, you can still neutralize one or both of the original cleaners, causing inactivity. A good example is the combination of drain cleaner (very basic) and toilet bowl cleaner (very acidic) to produce a neutral salt. Not to mention, such reactions can be dangerous in and of themselves because they tend to be exothermic (meaning they get very hot, and may boil or splatter unexpectedly). Therefore, I strongly recommend doing some research before mixing any household products. 

**2. Not all alcohol is the same.** Two different types of alcohol are frequently used in sanitizers: isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. They differ by the number of carbon atoms in the molecules. Isopropyl has three carbon atoms, and ethyl alcohol has two. Before chloroform can form, the bleach first must oxidize the alcohol to form a carbon-oxygen double bond. When ethyl alcohol is oxidized, it forms acetic acid, which is in vinegar. This will not lead to chloroform. Isopropyl alcohol, because of the arrangement of atoms, cannot be oxidized into an acid. Instead, the oxidation forms acetone, which is found in nail polish remover. Acetone further reacts with bleach to form chloroform. So to summarize: bleach reacts with both types of household alcohol. In neither circumstance do you make a better cleaner, but the reaction will only proceed to chloroform with isopropyl alcohol. 

**3. The haloform reaction is VERY exothermic.** The reaction by which bleach transfers chlorine to acetone and produces chloroform releases tons of heat. When the haloform reaction is done in a chemistry lab, it is usually done on ice. Without ice it can get incredibly hot and can boil without warning, splashing you with hot bleach. I'd argue that the biggest hazard when mixing bleach and alcohol is this heat, not the chloroform. 

**4. After all that, you really only make a teeny-tiny amount of chloroform!** I think this is perhaps the biggest misconception. It's easy to imagine someone mixing a gallon of bleach and a pint of alcohol and BAM they have a bucket of chloroform to take out their enemies. This can't be further from the truth. What they actually end up with is a bucket of saltwater and alcohol with maybe a teaspoon of chloroform in the bottom. The reason: chemicals only react in specific proportions. In order to oxidize one molecule of isopropyl alcohol to acetone, you need one molecule of bleach. Then, for the haloform reaction, you need three more molecules of bleach. That means that four molecules of bleach are needed for every molecule of alcohol. The issue is that bleach is super dilute. There isn't enough bleach in bleach to make this reaction efficient! It's like baking: if you had twenty boxes of cake mix, but only two eggs, you can only make one cake! So, according to some quick calculations, one teaspoon (5 mL) of isopropyl alcohol requires 300 mL (1.25 cups) of fresh bleach. If the reaction doesn't go to completion you can get chloroacetone which is quite irritating to the eyes. So according to the math, you're going to need many gallons of bleach to make any sizable amount of chloroform, so much that you'd probably look suspicious buying it.

**So, to recap: No, you're not going to put yourself to sleep by mixing bleach and alcohol**, so don't freak out! The biggest hazard is the heat formation, which can be mitigated by keeping everything cold.  However, there is **no reason to do it because the reaction consumes the bleach** which lessens the disinfectant nature of the mixture. Just **don't mix any cleaners unless you've done the research first!** Be safe everyone!

Preferably we would like to do it in some sort of glass, to see the reaction taking place, but I haven't been able to find any type of glass that claims to be fine at those temperatures. Pyrex only goes to about 900F or so.

Is there such a heat resistant glass out there, or would we be better off doing it in a small cast iron pot?",10,2020-04-11 13:16:31,chemistry

Essentially, the point of my project was to see how the reaction rate of a reaction between hydrochloric acid and magnesium changed with temperature. Here, I neglected to record how the concentration of HCl changes as the reaction progresses. All I recorded was the partial pressure of hydrogen gas, the product. I can then plot this and find the instantaneous rate at each point. Big whoop, now what? I didn't understand kinetics well at the time and now I'm realizing I don't know how to use either differential or integrated rate law using the concentration of products.

7909,fya07r,Have you ever heard of an Electro-Chemograph (Polarimeter) with a dropping mercury electrode (DME)?,"In about 1972 I bought a very old, Leeds and Northrup ""Electro-chemograph"".   [https://pdfslide.net/documents/leeds-northrup-electrochemograph-as-a-recording-alternating-current-polarograph.html](https://pdfslide.net/documents/leeds-northrup-electrochemograph-as-a-recording-alternating-current-polarograph.html)  Actually the only part I got was a large free-standing device with a chart-recorder on top, and a system at the bottom to generate  a sloped increasing or decreasing voltage.  It had calibration stickers as late as 1940 or so.   I did not get the dropping mercury electrode, or DME.   (I mostly used it for a chart recorder for a gas chromatograph.)

A dropping mercury electrode is just that:  An upper reservoir contains pure mercury, which slowly is released, drop by drop, via a stopcock, out of a very thin glass tube which is immersed in a solution that needs to be analyzed.  Mercury is also present as a large pool at the bottom of the solution.  Both mercury locations are electrically-connected to the voltage-source.  The voltage is slowly increased (or  decreased) , over a few minutes, and the chart recorder records the current flow, which changes in pulsation as the drop of mercury gets larger, and eventually the mercury drop falls away, into the pool of mercury below.  Think of the output like a sawtooth wave, dropping to a minimum current immediately after the mercury drop falls off, risking to a maximum as the mercury drop enlarges to its maximum volume.

The purpose of this setup was to identify possibly very small amounts of dissolved electrolyzable elements in that solution.  Different elements will electrolyze at different voltages, and the amount of current flowing is about proportional to the quantity of the material in the solution.

I would think that modern electronics could be used to improve this kind of analysis.  Today's electronics would make this trivial:  Voltages could be forced onto the droplet in a microsecond's time, and possibly much less.  Current could be measured equally rapidly.

So with metallic bonding, there is only intramolecular bonding since it is only one element. With salt the intramolecular bonding is ionic but what is its intermolecular bonding to each other? Would it be dipole dipole? If so, what is the difference between dipole-dipole and ionic bonding apart from the fact that one is intra and one is inter because it seems to me, it follows the same principle. Same with hydrogen bonding, it just seems like ionic bonding with molecules with certain atoms.

My background: I'm a bio major who has experience in more analytical chem because of my research experience and want to work in R&amp;D in pharmaceuticals and ultimately get a PhD in pharmacognosy or something where my research is more natural product focused.

I've been applying to jobs since early January, and I applied to some positions through Kelly Scientific not really knowing that it's mainly temporary work. I'm not against temporary work since I'm just taking a gap year or so before applying to PhD programs. The thing is the contract that I've just been offered is at a company which, to me, feels an entire world away from what I want to ultimately do with my career. Won't go into specifics but it's basically an oil/soil analyst position. 

Does having a job that is a long term contract negatively impact my career even if it's at a well known company? Or is it just a good way to get my foot in the door? Is it worth it to take a job even if it's not really in the field I want? Is it really stupid for someone with my experience/degree to agree to a job in this field? (It's just an analysis position).

I decided to compare the activation energy of a reaction between na2s2o3 and hcl with and without catalyst.

k = Ae-Ea/RT
The equation can be derived from k = Ae-Ea/RT to another form.
 ð  ln k = ln A - Ea/RT   or log k = log A - Ea/2.3RT
I considered 1/time which is the reaction rate as k because it is proportional to k.
I calculated the gradient from the graph of log (1/t) vs 1/T
and used the formula of gradient = -Ea/2.3RT
and got the activation energy of reaction with catalyst to be higher than Ea of reaction without catalyst, which is not possible for this reaction.
So the problem is the activation energy of the reaction with catalyst  is higher than Ea of reaction without catalyst. Please helpp",1,2020-04-08 13:04:37,chemistry

I carried out the hydrolysis in water with sodium hydroxide and monitored the reaction by TLC, then did HPLC on the end point. 

The reaction conditions:

1 g methyl ester of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid

50 mL 0.25M NaOH

50ºC

4 hours

&amp;#x200B;

I achieved 100% conversion of the methyl ester by TLC, which was confirmed by HPLC-UV. However, my yield of 4-hydroxycinnamic acid at the endpoint is only 60%mol, confirmed by a similar crystallization yield. The HPLC calibration is recent and a sample at t=0 gives the correct concentration, so I have little reason to suspect that the analytical is at fault.   


At such gentle hydrolysis conditions, I can't think of what this compound could be converting to. Am I missing a possible side reaction? For it to disappear from the HPLC-UV I figure the aromatic ring would have to be converted but that shouldn't be possible.",18,2020-04-08 10:07:56,chemistry

I do not know much about Chemistry, but hoping to find some help on here. I am helping some of my  semi professional farmer relatives with fertilizing/nourishing their plants and vegetables with Epsom salt.

Typically they purchased the Epsom salt in bags from the big box stores. They were referred to a friend who works in a chemical company and they sell 400lb barrels of (see below).

Is this basically similar to the store bought Epsom salt, but in dried form?

Apologies if this is not the right reddit board for this. 

## Dried Magnesium Sulphate BP Magnesium Sulfate

Dried Epsom Salts  
**Magnesium Sulphate Dried is offered in BP grade**  
Preparation  
Magnesium Sulphate Paste

**DEFINITION**  
Dried Magnesium Sulphate contains not less than 62.0% and not more than 70.0% of MgSO4.  
It may be prepared by drying magnesium sulphate at 100° until it has lost approximately 25% of its weight.

**CHARACTERISTICS**  
A white powder.  
Freely soluble in water; dissolves more rapidly in hot water.

**IDENTIFICATION**  
Yields the reactions characteristic of magnesium salts and of sulphates.

**TESTS**  
Acidity or alkalinity  
To 10 ml of a 7.5% w/v solution in carbon dioxide-free water add 0.05 ml of phenol red solution. Not more than 0.2 ml of either 0.01M hydrochloric acid VS or 0.01M sodium hydroxide VS is required to change the colour of the solution.  
Arsenic  
0.33 g dissolved in 25 ml of water complies with the limit test for arsenic, (3 ppm).  
Heavy metals  
Dissolve 1.3 g in 20 ml of water and add 1 g of ammonium chloride. 12 ml of the resulting solution complies with limit test A for heavy metals, Appendix VII. Use lead standard solution(1 ppm Pb) to prepare the standard (15 ppm).  
Iron  
0.33 g dissolved in 10 ml of water complies with the limit test for iron, Appendix VII (30 ppm).  
Chloride  
0.13 g dissolved in 15 ml of water complies with the limit test for chlorides, Appendix VII (400 ppm).  
Insoluble matter  
7.5 g dissolves in 20 ml of water, producing a solution which may be slightly turbid at first but which becomes clear in a few minutes.

8099,fwmlq8,What is it that makes instant black coffee whippable?,"I posted this in r/nostupid questions, but received no responses.

I've recently been experimenting with dalgona coffee ([https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dalonga\_coffee\_20606](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/dalonga_coffee_20606)). Basically, you mix equal parts instant coffee, sugar, and water - about a tablespoon of each per serving - and then whisk, like egg whites or cream, until you get firm peaks, and then serve floated over milk, like an upside-down cappuccino.

I looked up what happens, on a chemical level, when cream is whisked (y'all probably know this, but I'm leaving it in anyway as part of the thought process). Basically (very simplified, because I've only done enough chemistry for a biology degree) fat molecules have a water-loving head and water-hating tails, so they tend to form spheres with one another, with the heads facing water and the tails tucked safely inside. When you whisk, you break these up and they'll form new spheres, some of them around miniscule air bubbles. In this way, more and more air gets incorporated and 'held' in the mixture. This can't be exactly what's happening with the dalgona coffee because, as far as I can tell, instant coffee has no fat (unless this is one of those things where manufacturers are allowed to claim it's 0% fat because the amount in the serving size is technically too small to count?).

I also wondered if it might be to do with the sugar (imagine if you could whip soda!), but a quick Google showed that people have made sugar free versions with no trouble, but people have struggled to make it if they haven't used instant coffee. 

I looked up the chemistry of meringues ([http://theconversation.com/kitchen-science-the-chemistry-behind-amazing-meringue-and-perfect-cappuccino-64670](http://theconversation.com/kitchen-science-the-chemistry-behind-amazing-meringue-and-perfect-cappuccino-64670)) and apparently that has to do with uncurling amino acid 'tails' in some of the proteins (again, y'all probably already know this). Some amino acids are also hydrophobic/water-hating, so the tail will grab onto air molecules to hide from water. That article also explains that foaming milk (e.g., for lattes or cappuccinos) works in a similar way (and is easier to do if there is less fat in the milk, unlike whipping), but the foam is less stable than whipped egg whites due to differences in the specific proteins involved.

I suspect whipping black coffee is probably closest to whipping egg whites. The foam is very firm, so perhaps some of those disulphide bonds helping the egg whites keep their air are involved? Apparently instant coffee is only 0.1% protein, and I can't seem to find out exactly what those proteins are.  I'm not sure if it's relevant, but decaff coffee whips just fine.  I've tried halving the amount of coffee and using syrup rather than sugar, and that still whips well.  It does get harder if you increase the water without increasing the coffee.  I only have a hand whisk, which limits the amount of experimenting I'm willing/able to do.",11,2020-04-07 10:37:27,chemistry
8100,fwmev0,What is the use of alcohol in a solution of AgNO3 and H20?,"I came across this website which has a ""stealth ink"" 

http://www.stealth-ink.com/article/review

It states on that site: ""this is a mix of alchohol, water and some secret ingredient... ""

Now from doing some research I realize the ""secret ingredient"" is most likely AgNO3 (Silver Nitrate)

As AgNO3 is photosensitive/reacts to form a dark brown/black colour when exposed to sunlight.

My question is what is the use of alcohol in this solution, and what type of alcohol would they be referring to?

As my understanding AgNO3 is much more soluble in water than alcohol.

If anyone could add some insight as to why the alcohol is added it would be much appreciated.",9,2020-04-07 10:26:17,chemistry

I know a silicon atom has 4 electron at the outermost shell. If it interacts with oxygen atoms in this case 4 of them it loses electron and oxygen atom gains electron. Since the silicon atom's charge is +4 in a SiO4 tetrahedron it means it loses 4 electron and this leads me to think it gives 1 electron to every oxygen atom in the bond which makes oxygen atoms' charge -1. I think the total charge of bond would be -4 due to 4 \* -1 = -4 but the book I have says it is -8 meaning each oxygen atom has electric charge of -2.

I am a designer and have a surplus of large kelp in my possession which I am looking to use as a leather analogue. The problem with drying it is that it becomes rigid with loss of water and loses its textile value. As cellulose behaves differently to animal leather, I don’t believe tanning or other techniques will work on it. There is very little information on the internet about this. The closest I have come to someone creating a textile with it is this fellow, whose product seems to work really well: https://youtu.be/IWjRJms3Aww 
He mentions that he removes the water and replaces it with a ‘soft agent’ but won’t disclose his method due to patenting. 
So I’ve come to you chemists to ask: how might you extract the water from this cellulose while also keeping the integrity of the kelp, ie. it’s pliability/softness.

Hello everybody, in the past years I was not addicted to advanced polymer chemistry but now I have to figure out the difference between a responsive polymer and an Out Of Equilibrium material. I know that an O.O.E. material is not always a polymer but this is not the point. The literature I found is not so clear about this topic, indeed an out of equilibrium state is identified as a situation in which a continuous supply of energy is required to maintain a stationary state for an extended period of time (azobenzene isomerization, spiropyrane isomerization ecc) and when the energy supply stops the system as to come back to a most stable thermodynamic state. 

BUT

A responsive material is similar, it needs an external stimulus to perform work or do other things and when the stimuli stop, it does not come back to the initial state, right? But I found some papers talking about azobenzene systems as responsive materials so I can't figure out where exactly is the difference between these systems.

Since the majority of the molecules are in ground vibrational state at room temperature we are observing delta_v=+1 for each peak. I know that in the P branch the rotational quantum number J is decreasing, and that in the R branch the value of J is increasing. 

The part that’s confusing me is the why the lowest energy peak in the spectrum (leftmost peak in the P branch; wave numbers increasing along x-axis) corresponds to the J=11 to J=10 transition. I’m assuming that the wavenumber values in the P branch are not energetic enough to cause excitation in both the rotational and vibrational states, so in order for a vibrational excitation to occur you must have a rotational relaxation. The energy spacing between the 11th and 10th energy level is much smaller than that of the spacing between the 1st and ground stat energy levels.

I understand the primary reason for failure of batteries of this kind is sulfation of the electrodes, though mechanical damage from heat is another possibility.

I understand lead sulfate degrades at about 1000C, but I don't think I fancy trying to reach that temperature, so I guess the main question is whether the lead sulfate would tend to separate to the surface of the molten lead (or the bottom) where I could scrape it off...

I expect the batteries themselves are of a design that's not intended to ever be opened, so I'd have a second round of engineering to do to re-seal them or whatever, but that's a problem for another day / sub :-P",4,2020-04-04 07:07:40,chemistry

8335,fuese8,Why water vapour decreases partial pressure of oxygen???," 

When you have oxygen in the air, the partial pressure of it is: 160mmHg for 0.21% of O2

When you have oxygen in the trachea, the partial pressure of it is 150mmHg for the same 0.21%, because you add water vapour.

 I can't figure why partial pressure of oxygen decreases when you add water vapour. I explain: Image one box with 1 liter of volume and oxygen making 160mmHg of pression in that box. If u put water vapour in that 1L box, thinking with logic the oxygen partial pressure will increase, not decrease to 150mmHg (because you are adding things to a finite space). I just can't figure it out why this decrease of 160 to 150 happens. 

I can't understands why that happens. I see the numbers and calculations (PO2intrachea = (760-47)0.21), but can't explain why. The partial pressure of a gas shouldn't be equal in the same conditions of temperature and volume?

8361,fu78ih,Has anyone here ever studied with Atkins' Chemical Principles? What's your opinion? I find it very confusing.,"This is one of the most famous college books in Chemistry, I've seen it's used in the US, Europe, Latin America... It must be good, but I'm studying by myself in this quarantine and find it so confusing. My poor knowledge of chemistry must be a reason... But also, I started studying with another book (Chemistry by Kotz) and I was having no big problems, everything seemed clear and fluid... But my professor recommends Atkins instead, so I switched. 

An example of how confusing it is, when it gets to the part of ""naming compounds"" (Fundamentals D), it just brings pages of rules... and then throws a bunch of exercises, you try to apply the rules but right in the first exercises, nothing works, there is no logical way to deduce how to name those compounds just with the rules they provide... you will be totally unable to go ahead and solve the exercises even going back to the pages. I thought I was stupid for not being able to apply the rules.

Then I started breaking my head looking for other resources, explanations... Youtube teachers saved me when they said: no, you are not stupid, there is no way to know, you have to memorize this list of polyatomic ions. The book never mentions that you need that knowledge to solve the exercises.  That is: either you memorize it, Google it or look for a table, the rules won't work.

Anyway, if you are also having problems with that, watch Tyller Dewitt's lessons about naming compounds. 

I also made this table of polyatomic ions I had posted here before. The exercises are very easy now... But I think Atkins' book makes things so difficult. Does anyone have the same problem?

However, I read somewhere that fructose in honey does not crystalize because of its water solubility. Fructose is a humectant and holds on to water. Fructose is also the most soluble of the monosaccharides. 
        My question is why is fructose more soluble? Fructose and glucose have the same molecular formula. I know that fructose is a ketone sugar and glucose is aldehyde sugar. I also know that they have tautomer. Both can exist as 6 of 5 member rings. But, glucose prefers 6 member rings (~90% abundance)and fructose 5 member ring (~ 70% ). 
       For me both can hydrogen bond with water. I don’t understand how is fructose bond more strongly to water than glucose? They have the same number of oxygens. Why is harder for fructose to crystallize? Chemical wise. 
         I am bit frustrated because I could find a good answer. Most sites just state that fructose is more water soluble never explaining why or very poor explanations.

The papers i've read focus mainly on the amide as it's a precursor to some anti tubercolotic meds. They quickly mention that the citrazinamide can be converted to the free acid by hydrolysis with caustic alkali and heating for some hours.
Can anybody experienced in amide hydrolysis give me some tips on what ph to aim for and how many hours should the reaction usually take to convert all the amide into acid?
The reaction should be citrazinamide + sodium hydroxide and heat-&gt; sodium citrazinate + ammonia, then sodium citrazinate + hcl -&gt; citrazinic acid + sodium chloride.
Thank you in advance.",15,2020-04-01 14:54:11,chemistry
8471,ft73dq,Looking for a proof of total pressure in function of vapor composition.,"We know, by Raoult's ""law"" and Dalton ""law"", that the total pressure of two components in binary liquid mixture in function of liquid composition (x) is:

But then, when we rewrite this in function of vapor composition (y) we get this:

8480,ft52q9,Does anyone knowledge or experience with the chemistry of salvia divinorum or more specifically salvia extracts (fortified leaf)?,"I'm looking for help in figuring out if 91% iso used as a solvent to infuse the salvinorin from some extracts I bought onto corn starch will also remove the lipids and I'm guessing plant fats that are necessary for quidding methods (sublingual and buccal absorptions) ? I'm assuming because I'm trying something with already standardized extracts that someone created for use with regular leaf there will already be much of the tannins and other components useful for sublingual methods removed from the salvia during the original extraction process used to make the fortified leaf. I'm hoping it's a crude extract. So I'm wondering from someone with a scientific mind with knowledge in chemistry if they think 91% isopropyl would still be a good solvent for extracting the salvinorin from the already bought extracts or if too much of the tannins were removed if I should use vegetable glycerin with white vinegar instead. The original creator of this Tek for a proper quid method used 3 washes of 91% iso with regular leaf not extract for his most potent results. Originally he used vegetable glycerin with white vinegar and it worked too . So to round up my main question do you think I could successfuly extract the salvinorin A from extract not from regular leaf with 3 warm 91% iso washes or should I try 1 wash because the might remove all the tannins and lipids or whatever it is I need for sublingual absorption. I plan on using this very responsibly in very small amounts for subtle doses. I am 30 and don't want to smoke because of cov19 and I'm going to be safe and cautious and am responsible. I've had experience with hash extractions before so I know to be careful with working with solvents and I don't plan on having any of this near open flames, sparks or hear surfaces. For the warm iso I plan on just using hot tap water in a bowl. And I will take the precautions to ventilate and not breathe in the iso as well. Please if anyone can help me figure out what won't remove too much of the tannins or lipids or whatever it's called and how many washes with iso they'd guesstimate would be best to go about this",4,2020-04-01 12:58:56,chemistry

It's been used for a while in a few countries mainly in the medical, agricultural and hotel industry (amongst others)

"" It turns out that zapping salt water with low-voltage electricity creates a couple of powerful yet nontoxic cleaning agents. Sodium ions are converted into sodium hydroxide, an alkaline liquid that cleans and degreases like detergent, but without the scrubbing bubbles. Chloride ions become hypochlorous acid, a potent disinfectant known as acid water ""

A Korean company sells a version of this for a very expensive price:

Are preprint papers really needed?,"I've taken inspiration from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/frsd16/the_best_thing_you_can_do_to_fight_covid19_is/) from our /r/Physics brothers and sisters, that I recommend you to read. I'm not a great writer, I'll try to be as clear as I can.

Our job (organic, medicinal, computational... whatever floats your boat) is **crucial** in this time of need. And for this reason, we need to be careful with what we say.

Similarly to [this physics preprint service](https://arxiv.org), this [chemistry preprint server](https://chemrxiv.org) is slammed with [new research](https://chemrxiv.org/?q=title%3A%22COVID-19%22%20OR%20title%3A%22SARS%20COV%202%22%20OR%20title%3A%22coronavirus%22%20OR%20description%3A%22COVID-19%22%20OR%20description%3A%22SARS%20COV%202%22%20OR%20description%3A%22coronavirus%22&amp;searchMode=1) everyday. 

Now, I (as a lowly PhD student) am not in the position of deciding whether a piece of research is ""good"" or not, nor if it really shows the ""urgency"" that these kind of services were made for. But what if the computational paper **you** published there, suggesting that the pharmaceutically active ingredient of a simple cough syrup could prevent the entry of the virus in the cells, is picked up by a journalist in need of something to write on? What if that article pushes people to drink cough syrup as if it is nothing, due to the fear of contracting the virus?

For sure, the ""Big Pharma"" would have evaluated the exact same scenario, reaching the conclusion that the cough syrup wouldn't have been an effective cure and was not worth pursuing further. And now, bypassing all that rational thinking, your preprint paper pushed people into potentially poisoning themselves.

So, is a ""not-so-valuable"" publication worth the lives of people? What do you think?",25,2020-03-31 08:02:47,chemistry

8603,fs6dvt,Chemistry PhD Decision,"I applied to schools based on the research professors were doing at each and hoped that when I visited I would be able to feel which school was the best fit for me. I have visited three schools and I really liked them all. I connected really well with at least one professor at each school and am very interested in the research being done at all the schools. All stipends and living expenses are equally weighted. Below I've listed the factors that I am considering for each school.

School A: This school is a higher ranked school with a larger program. This makes it more prestigious, but it also has the largest research groups with about 10 grad students per group. I am a small town girl, so I always feel more comfortable in smaller, close-knit groups. I have three professors I would definitely like to study under and there was one professor I really felt like I have a good connection to. However, this school feels very big and overwhelming to me. This is a very small contributing factor, but it is also the furthest from my boyfriend. (This is a small factor because I am not the type of person to pick a school based on where my boyfriend is and he is also in the Navy so he will be going on 6 month deployments and changing bases in a few years anyways.)

School B: I absolutely loved the people here. They were so kind and welcoming but the facilities and instrumentation are not as nice or new as School A. I only see myself working with one professor, but I know she would make a great adviser for me and I like her research. The distance is closer to my boyfriend, so visiting every now and then would be easier than School A.

School C: The professors were all very welcoming. The professor I would want to work with hosted my visit, and straight up told me that he really wanted me to go there and that he thinks I would be a great addition to his research lab. This makes me feel like I would be able to individual attention from my adviser, especially since the research groups are only have 3-4 grad students. I would love to work with him and am really interested in his research. The professors I met with also talked about how they like to push their students to make publications as a first author and I really think that opportunity will be great for me. The only downside of this school is that it is in a city and that have always been a little overwhelming to me even though the city is small. I'm nervous that I would have a hard time being comfortable there. Another perk is that it would be close enough to my boyfriend's base so that we could live together and cut down on living expenses until he has to move.",12,2020-03-30 23:29:15,chemistry

However, he realizes that if the plum pudding model isn't accurate, then it would statistically take an ungodly amount of time to see a result that would prove it. So he was like ""lol nope. Where are my interns/assistants?"" And then he gets Geiger and Marsden to sit in a dark room and watch the foil being bombarded for hours till an alpha particle gets deflected at a crazy angle.

I've looked up other sources, but they just say that Geiger and Marsden performed the experiment under Rutherford. Would it be inaccurate to portray things like this?",12,2020-03-30 03:29:16,chemistry

I have been wondering lately, about how easily your typical moisturizer can trap and stick to hydrocarbons and stuff.



If they can trap water under them so that they nourish the skin with the help of humectants, what about other materials?


I ask this because I can easily come into contact with indoxacarb and lead on a daily basis, the latter being due to the likely usage of lead paint in my house, and the former due to many things in my house contacting roach gel. 



I have cuts on my hands due to soap overuse. I'm just worried the humectants can cause indoxacarb and lead to stick to them, bring them under the skin, into the cut, directly givining it a pathway into my bloodstream.

But I think it is not actually poisonous:  Our bodies convert methanol into formaldehyde, which is toxic.   (There was an episode of the TV show House in which a prisoner on Death Row drank some methanol-containing toner.  House treated the prisoner by giving him ordinary ethyl alcohol,which competed in that prisoner's body for an enzyme which caused the oxidation of the methyl alcohol, thereby saving his life.   

Most of us avoid drinking auto anti-freeze, because ""it's poisonous"":   But I think it is n ot actually poisonous:  Our bodies convert ethylene glycol, the ordinary constituent of auto anti-freeze, into oxalic acid, which is toxic.  (since the early 1970, a chemical called ""Bitrex"" has been used to make auto antifreeze extremely bitter, causing people and animals to avoid drinking it.)

There is a chemical trade-named Compound 1080, which is sodium fluoroacetate, which is used to kill animals.  I read, decades ago, that the actual killing agent is sodium fluorocitrate:  The body converts Sodium fluoroacetate into fluorocitrate.

8812,fqfpkd,Quinine Dosing in Peruvian Cinchona Bark,"Quinine from the bark of the Peruvian cinchona tree is the historical natural remedy for malaria.  Modern synthetic derivatives of quinine are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.   Keeping in mind that interest in these things is probably driven by their potential - as yet NOT proven - to treat coronavirus, this leads to an interesting question about cinchona bark.   How can you convert a given dose of conchina officinalis into a dose of quinine?

It seems to me extremely unwise to take cinchona bark as a tea since you have no idea what the concentration of the active ingredient would be in one product versus another.   Interestingly, cinchona bark is not regulated and is sold widely online.   Apparently quinine is an active ingredient in gin and tonic, and there are complaints online that custom-made syrups from cinchona bark deliver up to twice as high as dose of quinine as is allowed under regulations for gin and tonic.     High doses of quinine can be fatal, so it was a surprise to me that it's herbal source is not tightly regulated.

Would dosing of quinine be any more predictable starting from a tincture of conchina officinalis rather than from cinchona bark?   One tincture of conchina officinalis lists whole plant extract of 400 mg and herbal equivalent of 2000 mg.   What does that imply relative to the amount of quinine that might be in the product?   That could be expressed as a range of doses given the imprecise nature of the source.

This post is not a recommendation to take any drug or herb.   Personally, I think you would be crazy to self medicate with anything like this.  I am simply expressing a pure curiosity about chemistry and how to calculate the dosing of an herb.",0,2020-03-28 02:40:56,chemistry

Specifically asking from the standpoint of something like pyrotechnics, and I'll use copper as an example:

In pyrotechnics we use various copper compounds in the presence of chlorine donors to produce blue colored flames. The most common compounds used are cupric oxide, copper carbonate, or (my favorite) copper oxychloride. A big goal with blue stars is to keep the flame envelope small and *keep the combustion temperature low*. I've always sort of operated under the assumption that all copper salts burn at roughly the same temperature and that the fuels/oxidizers used in the compositions are the primary things that influence the temperature of the reaction.

Recently, however, I've reduced a usable amount of elemental copper powder from a few solutions, and it's about the consistency of other copper salts I use for coloring flames. I initially scoffed at the prospect of trying to make blue stars using elemental copper, because it I assumed it ""burns too hot"", but now I'm second guessing that. 

I know that things like atomic radius can dramatically affect the *melting* point of compounds, but is this also true of combustion reactions? If the oxidation state of copper and the compound that it's in affect combustion temperature, wouldn't it make the most sense to use a copper compound with a very low melting point over one with a high melting point? Or does that matter at all?

&amp;#x200B;

I am teaching in a chemistry program that has shifted to completely online, and we are being told to prepare for next term to also be online. Next term I am involved in practicals, and it sure is tough to do practical synthetic chemistry online. One of the options we are weighing up is to have the students watch a video of a synthesis and to write a report based on that. This would mean we need a good video of someone carrying out a synthesis (either in a university teaching lab, or in a well set-up home lab). So far all that I have been able to find are people explaining how a reaction works, rather than exclusively doing it. I don't want the mechanisms etc that I would normally say are a good idea, since I want them to come up with that. We can't make the video ourselves either, since we are compulsorily working from home for the foreseeable future. This would not be the whole course, but it is one component we could do wholly online and where we can work on their observation and description skills.

  
To give an idea of the sort of reactions that we would be replacing, this is a second year undergraduate organic chemistry and their first reactions are synthesis of paracetamol (acetaminophen) and aspirin. They do this by acetylation in both cases,  with a focus on different selectivities and reactivities needed. It doesn't have to be this, but something similar would be great.

8867,fq0su0,Classes to take to focus more on Applied Chem/ Engineering,"tl;dr: What classes should I take in a physics and chemistry major to be closer to engineering for grad school

I'm currently a  second year Chemistry (BS)/Physics (BA) double major looking to go to grad school for probably Material Science Engineering as it seems to be the best combination of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering. Financially and research wise, it seems as though material science engineering has great potential for me.  My ultimate goal is to do meaningful research but also be able to run my own research firm eventually.

My question is how should I structure my Chemistry and Physics classes now to get more of an engineering side of things instead of just the pure science. My school allows for a good bit of choice in electives in the Physics major after taking the required classes. I already have Calc 1-3 under my belt and will be taking differential equations next semester. I will also be taking Experimental Physics. Analytical Chemistry, and Biochem, along with a possible gen ed or business class.

For the finance/business side of things, would you guys recommend taking classes in school or just reading books outside of class to build those skills.

---

Hi everyone, I distill my own alcohol and enjoy reading r/firewater. There seems to be a number of tables, charts and articles that explain that silicone and ethanol are fairly good friends. The firewater community seems rather against using silicone in place of lead-free solder to attach pipes together because hot ethanol vapour doesn't seem to be well regarded with silicone joints. Can y'all weigh in on that? The total area exposed to the vapour will be the space between the pipe and fittings, which is fairly small, but there are a dozen or so of them.


My eldest brother is a pipefitter and says great things about attaching metal using silicone -- he often has to use a pry bar to pull gaskets and flanges apart that have silicone in there. I expect to solder 3"" copper pipe together, but it's a lot for a propane blow torch to do, so I'll have to sweet talk (or bribe ..) my welder brother into helping me use an oxyacetylene torch to solder the pipes.",2,2020-03-26 09:32:56,chemistry

9047,foemei,Synthesis of pure esters from long-chain alcohols using Fischer esterification,"Fischer esterification is straightforward when making esters from small alcohols, up to 5-carbon alcohols, because water washes can remove any remaining alcohol in workup.

Once you get to 6 carbons and higher, water washes are unable to remove the alcohol from the crude ester, and this affects the smell.

Larger esters, such as octyl acetate and nonyl acetate, have interesting smells. octyl acetate is citrus, orange, earthy, while nonyl acetate is mushroom, but the presence of residual 1-octanol and 1-nonanol can contaminate the smell.

One way is to have the reaction go to completion, so that all the alcohol is used up. Use an excess of carboxylic acid, since it can be easily neutralized to its carboxylate salt and extracted with water. Instead of using acid chlorides or anhydrides, which are harder to get, you can use the Dean-Stark method for fischer esterification, which dissolves all reactants and catalysts in toluene, and uses a Dean-stark trap to capture formed water. A nice thing about this method is that you can track reaction progress by looking at the volume of water in the trap, and once water stops forming, the reaction is done.",0,2020-03-24 17:26:14,chemistry

9127,fo2ug1,Behaviour of molten metal interacting with polylactic acid," Hello all!  


I am kinda shooting in the dark here. I'm a mechanical engineering student with very little knowledge of chemistry. I'm trying to figure out a proces for casting a 3d printed model by directly pouring molten iron (1400C) on top of it.  


The model is coated by a ceramic coating and put in a sand container. The molten metal 'interacts' with the PLA model by melting and evaporating(?) the PLA. The metal will take the shape of the 3D printed model inside the ceramic coating shell, leaving a casted product. I have done a few tests which came out decent, I am however eager to know about what *exactly* happens when these two materials (fluid metal, and PLA) interact with eachother.  


What happens to the PLA, how fast does this happen, what kind of rest products are left behind, how much gas does the PLA produce? Information like this would be useful for me to know, to maybe screen for other printing materials other than PLA. I'm basically trying to analytically see what happens with the material.  


For example, I want as little gas production from the material, because this gas needs to leave via the ceramic coating. So if I can screen a material beforehand this would be useful.  


Would anyone know how I can figure this out, maybe some useful online tools/databases/literature?  


I hope I am asking this in the right place!  


Thanks in advance.

I can confirm it is HCN because the fraction came over between 26 and 30°C gas-phase temperature and it proceeded to burn after ignition. My theory nr. **1)** is that there was a small amount of water in the vapor phase, and, that it effectively worked like an azeotrope, just for melting points, i.e. reducing it. But it wouldn't be me if I hadn't searched for another possibility: **2)** I made the -5°C measurement with a laser thermometer, which can produce faulty results when the laser hits the object at an angle (kinda amorphous structure, so that is possible), or when the material is translucid (which it wasn't, it was some milky-white-ish); so perhaps the HCN did evaporate but by virtue of that cooled down the rest to a point where it would be solid.

9194,fnjjmq,Can't Find Bleach Anywhere... What about diluting a Clorox toilet cleaning puck?,"Hey folks -- as many are aware, there is a serious shortage of household sanitizing/disinfecting supplies. I have nothing except about 40 mL of 70% isopropyl alcohol and a shit ton of simple green which does nothing except smell OK but does not disinfect anything. I have checked numerous stores over the weekend and there is simply nothing in stock.

I have a single 100g puck of Clorox toilet bowl cleaner that's been sitting under my sink for months, unused. https://www.amazon.com/Clorox-Automatic-Toilet-Cleaner-Tablets/dp/B00UNT65FM

Anyone have thoughts about diluting this puck for disinfecting uses outside of the toilet?

It's been a minute since my college chemistry courses, but for a thought exercise:

My toilet is 6 L/flush, which is average. The packaging says this puck should last 3 months at 10 flushes per day (sounds generous), but in theory and assuming that's based on the average volume per flush in the toilet industry, that's 6 L/fush * 10 flushes/day * 90 days = 5,400 L at a concentration adequate to kill common bacterial pathogens (I am unsure its effectiveness against coronaviridae).

I have a spray bottle with markings up to 25 oz / 739 mL.

Assuming the marketing is true: 100 g / 54,000 mL = 0.00185185185 g/mL --&gt; we'll just round that to 0.002 g/mL

0.002 g/mL * 739 mL = 1.4 g of the puck per spray bottle. Could I simply (and safely w/ appropriate PPE I have on-hand) break this puck up, measure it out, and call it a day for household sanitizing purposes?

9212,fnd56g,Chemistry Childhood memories - What are yours?,"Hi!  
&amp;nbsp;  
So, many of us who got a background in chemistry probably have held an interest  
in the subject for many years, possibly back into our childhood. And some of us  
might have experimented in the 'hobby lab' even back then. Probably with primitive  
methods, and not for scientific merit or practical reasons but simply to satify  
our curiosity. What are your own memories of that time, that still stand out to  
you even today? I'll start with two stories of my own.  
&amp;nbsp;  
*The Mysterious Glow*  
So, I think I was in my early teens back then. Around 14. This was in the 80s,  
before the internet. If you wanted to learn about chemistry, or any subject really,  
you'd either hit up the library or poke your teacher at school.  
My interests were all over the place. Biology, chemistry, geology... I was an avid  
collector of minerals and fossils, hunting for new finds everyday after school. And  
when the weather was bad and I had to stay indoors, well... time to put my newest  
finds to the test. Minerals were identified and categorized, subjected to diverse  
tests with acids, heated in a mini furnace, often just to see what would happen.  
&amp;nbsp;  
One day I had just come across a nice sample of fluorite. Part of it got pulverized.  
Now, this wasn't just some common oxide, silicate, carbonate. This was something  
unusual to me. So.. let's see what happens if we heat this up. It was a cold winter  
day, the room was dark, my simple crucible was set up on the heat proof surface of  
the wood-fired kitchen stove...  
Adding a teaspoon of the powdered mineral to the already hot crucible, the strangest,  
eeriest glow suddenly filled the room! All purple-blueish, with hints of violet!  
There was no fire... but there was LIGHT! I MADE LIGHT! A marvellous discovery  
that was! But...what was it, exactly? Once the glow subsided, the powder seemed  
physically unchanged, but heating it a second time did not result in any glow.  
So... something must have happened to it. A Mystery!  
The answer had me stumped for weeks, till I found the right resources at the library.  
THERMOLUMINISCENSE! The release of ionizing radiation previously  
absorbed by the mineral, in the form of visible light! And I HAD DISCOVERED IT!  
Well, or so young me at least was feeling. And what an exhilerating feeling it was.  
&amp;nbsp;  
*You made ammonia from WHAT?*  
About a year later experiments in the little 'hobby lab' were still going strong.  
I had made good friends with the chemistry teacher at school, if I needed chemicals  
and it was just small amounts and nothing obviously dangerous, I could get my supplies  
there. Among those supplies was some magnesium.  
Now, back then I wanted to experiment with home-made fireproof materials. Ceramics  
mostly. And to start out, I needed a small supply of magnesium oxide. Nothing easier  
than that, let's burn a small amount of the magnesium I had. So I piled maybe 2-3  
spoonfuls of the silvery white metal shavings on a stone surface, lit it, then waited  
for it all to burn without looking into the pretty white light all too much. So bright,  
so beautiful. Not like the light of a flame, but powerful as that of a star!  
When the fire had subsided, I was left with my pile of magnesium oxide... or so I thought.  
The outside of the burned remains was bright white, as you'd expect from MgO to be.  
But why was much of the inside a greyish yellow? Whatever, this was my oxide, let's  
now all mix it with water to form a slurry. Except, as soon as I did that, the strong  
stench of ammonia filled the room! IMPOSSIBLE! There's no nitrogen in MnO! And none  
in water either! Preposterous! HOW COULD THIS BE! The smell was proof enough that  
ammonia had formed. The hydrogen I could explain, this could have come from the water.  
But... the nitrogen? Wait... I burned this in AIR! And air is mostly nitrogen! Could it  
be? Shuffling around stochiatric formulas, I came up with a solution that worked out  
on paper. Magnesium...NITRIDE?! I had made Magnesium nitride! Found a way to fix  
nitrogen from air! Not the expected result of my little experiment AT ALL, but... this  
was exciting! Of course I showed my results to my teacher. They TOO were suprised at  
first by the results, but later on actually used the reaction as an example of why  
reaction parameters matter, and how usually 'inert' and easily overlooked by-reagents  
in your reaction can lead to entirely different results than what is expected on paper.

9219,fnbak2,"Table for memorizing Polyatomic Ions roughly organized by element, charge, prefixes and endings.","I'd like to share this table, but more than that, I'd like to ask you for suggestions on how you would group polyatomic ions to make it easier to memorize. 

I've made this table after watching the lesson below. So it is NOT complete, it just includes what is mentioned in the lesson (I also don't think we need to memorize all the polyatomic ions that exist, right?). 

It consists of rough associations just for the sake of memorization. For example, I could make these three big chunks (green, orange and blue) and other small chunks which I find much easier to memorize and reconstruct by associating some pattern of prefixes, endings, elements and charges.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I associate:

\- With Cl, Br and I, things are completely regular: same affixes, same number of oxigens and charge -1. 

\- N, S and P start with three pretty regular lines (in orange), charge -3 for nitride and then -1, -2, -3 respectively.

\- I associate azide with disulfide (single element formed by N and S respectively).

\- Then for S and P, we go down to hydrogen and dihydrogen (in blue). 

\- In N, from cyanide, I can get to THIOcyanate, which I associate to THIOsulfate and PYROphosphate (yellow).

\- Still in N, I get ammonium, which has a positive charge like hydronium, going down to those with oxygen and finally those with carbon on the third column. 

\- The other ones are a bit left out. 

I also use Anki to memorize them (I highly recommend). 

If you have any suggestions... thanks!

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm applying to a university in like a week or so and I'm pretty sure I'd like to do something involving chemistry. In fact, I've narrowed it down to the two (probably classic) choices: Chemistry or Chemical Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked into both opportunities and all the info I seem to find all suggest the same thing: Chemists do stuff in labs and chemical engineers do stuff in factories. I'd like to do a bit of both maybe, I'm not sure, but I'd like to actually learn about chemistry and put that knowledge to use - maybe product design or idk - and the university of technology ( here's the link if you're interested [https://www.aalto.fi/en](https://www.aalto.fi/en) ) where I could study ChemEng is quite active when it comes to innovation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have no issue with maths or physics, I like them both a lot, but what I am afraid of is getting into chemical engineering and then finding out that it's really not that much chemistry and more of just thermodynamics and optimization of the Haber-Bosch process. I'd really like to be able to look at something and know how it can be used to make another thing - or to look at a reaction and know what happens and why it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd like your input. I know this isn't a decision you can make for me, but if you have the time to tell me about your career and education and what it involved or just comment some ideas on this topic, that would help me out a lot.

Recently I was reminiscing with a middle school friend of mine and a memory I had long forgotten suddenly sprang into mind! Grade 7 chem class (2005)  one of my classmates had broken a thermometer during a lab experiment and panicked; they threw out the broken glass but for some reason had poured the Mercury (say 0.7 grams as per typical thermometers apparently) into my water bottle which I drank not long after.

I found out a couple years later in passing as it became ""one of those funny stories"" and I never took it seriously... but now I'm seriously contemplating the repercussions of that incident?

What are your opinions or recommendations?

PS
1. Not mad at all at my classmate nor ever have been, we've all done irrational things,

2. Not seeking medical advice per se, just opinions from learned people in the field,

9276,fmtjt5,I believe I have discovered an optimization of the synthesis of silver acetylide double salt.,"I was researching a new experiment where I synthesize silver acetylide double salt (btw the rules of this subreddit allow for me to discuss this and it is legal to synthesize high explosives so long as you do not transport, sell, transfer to another person, or store them and they remain on your property) and I had seen a wide variety of colors from other people's product and slight differences in their method of synthesis. I read on sciencemadness that the best and  least sensitive (from friction and shock) double salt is formed when the precipitate is perfectly white. I had struggled to make my precipitate perfectly white and almost gave up. My previous experiments used varying amounts of heat, nitric acid, utilized a scrubber solution for the acetylene, and the timing of when the acetylene is allowed to bubble through the solution. The first two attemtps resulted in a tan precipitate that liked to turn greyish even when left in almost complete darkness. The next four attemtps left me with a white product encased in a layer of black and was also semi prone to turning greyish with little light. Then I changed things up. I bubbled acetylene through acetone since acetylene is very soluble in acetone. I added my solution of dilute nitric acid and diluted silver nitrate and the whitest precipitate I have seen formed immediately. This was really good news. I tested the product and it is very powerful when dry and rips through aluminum foil like nothing in milligram amounts. The color seemed to remain consistent even with a decent amount of light (not sunlight). I plan to test the varying color products in terms of sensitivity and power and might post my results. I haven't heard or seen of anyone else making silver acetylide double salt this way and I have looked everywhere. I am really excited since I feel like I may have finally been able to contribute to the science community instead of following someone else's experiments.",2,2020-03-21 22:58:39,chemistry
9277,fmt74e,Deciding where to go (Chemistry PhD),"Hi y’all,

So over the past month I’ve been having a lot of trouble deciding where I want to get my PhD. I was hoping to get some insight on how you all decided between your final two places. The places I’m deciding between are Princeton Chemistry and the Chemical Biology Interface (CBI) program at JHU. I’ve visited both places and feel very torn. I have multiple professors I’d like to work with at each school so the science isn’t a problem at either. 

I’m not sure what I want to do after grad school and I feel like Princeton is better suited to set me up for Pharma/Industry while JHU is better for medical/NIH research career. I don’t know which is a better broad stepping stone to the future.

Any insight at all is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",3,2020-03-21 22:35:05,chemistry

If the electrons are delocalized throughout the structure, and electrons are what give a substance it's physical resistance, then you shouldn't be able to penetrate the ""pores"" in the graphene structure as the electron orbitals overlap and turn the entire thing into a molecular plane.

My sister takes 'MMS' (Miracle mineral supplement)  drops with 0,3% chlorine dioxide in it. I googled, it's dangerous and not meant to be swallowed. 

3 questions: 

1) I read that chlorine dioxide is very unstable and not easy to transport. Her MMS drops is already in water with chlorine dioxide form. Is it broken down already? (She keeps it in the fridge at 8 degrees C, and Wikipedia says it only becomes gas at &gt;11 degrees C) 
2) her MMS AChlorine Dioxide concentration is only 0.3%. I read that in EU levels over 0,01% (0,1mg/L) are forbidden in drinking water (it's used in every tenth of German drinking water purification stations). But I also read that when tested with 2,4% concentrations with humans, it did not show any harmful results. So is 0,3% chlorine dioxide really that bad? 
3) It stated that even in low concentrations, it can burn the oesophagus, cause kidney disease and some other pathologies. On the other hand I read that in low %, it is antiviral, antibacterial (against - gram bacteria) and antifungal. I think she wants to use the MMS against Coronavirus infection (which starts in the throat...). what do you think about this?

However I didn't find much after a bit of googling. I only found stuff like computed properties and documents on weird organic copper(I) nitrate complexes (absolutely not my area). So I decided to try and make some. 

I started with a copper chloride solution (pcb etchant) and added a solution of ascorbic acid to it. This precipitated out copper(I) chloride. Then I washed the precipitate with a bit of water. I then removed the water and redissolved the copper(I) chloride in some fairly conc. hydrochloric acid (it forms some sort of a soluble complex) and added a solution of potassium carbonate. This precipitated orange copper(I) carbonate. Again I washed the solid with water and added some dilute nitric acid to it. It should react to form copper(I) nitrate, water and CO2. As I expected it bubbled and changed its colour from an orange to a white. The product was an insoluble white powder.

So I definitly made something. But i'm not sure if it's the right product. After all there should be a lot more information on this substance if its that easy to prepare. I would like to hear what you think about it or why there's so little info.",7,2020-03-20 16:11:03,chemistry

Currently in my fourth year and final year of a Chemistry Single Major - and it has never dawned on me that I have never been thought about radical reactions. Is there any reason behind this (e.g. rarity or hard to control i.e. so DAMMMN reactive)?. 

Radical chemistry actually appears moderatley often (eg, gringard synthesis, radical polymerisation).

Basically i have two main questions:

(1) is radical chemistry taught elsewhere?

(2) is there any resources to explain a little radical chemistry to me?

A former supervisor of mine was just laid off and reached out to me looking for a LinkedIn endorsement. He did not offer to reciprocate or give me endorsements. 

My experience with him did not warrant a LinkedIn endorsement and if anyone had asked me I would never have given excellent feedback. As a scientist I didn't usually agree with his ideas or approach, as a supervisor his communication skills left a lot to be desired. He is somebody who I would hope would never use me as a reference. He was my hiring manager but as soon as I caught onto his management style, I figured out a way to make a department transfer and went for it.

I left the company a few months ago and I'm back in grad school now, so I don't think that there should be any consequences for telling him no, but I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to help me say it in a way that 1) puts the responsibility back on him and 2) doesn't leave him holding a grudge against me when I'm trying to just be professional.

1. If I want to make a Buffer at 3.9pH I’ve read that HCOOH is the optimal acid, but what’s the reasoning for that?

2. In practical example if I wanted to use NaOH and HCOOH but one component is stronger than the other say I have a 2.5 molar NaOH, and add that to 1.0L HCOOH how would I need to get my 3.9pH? Would I have to double the NaOH?",4,2020-03-20 12:58:14,chemistry

I’m finding conflicting information on efficacy, but it looks like in proper concentration it can be used as a hand sanitizer. The idea right now is to use the stock of various restaurants/restaurant supply companies and figure out how to process it for our EMTs etc.

My questions are:
What specific compounds would work? Dymethyl Benzyl Ammonium Chloride Dihydrate (the most common)? From what I can find it works on enveloped lipid containing viruses and works with other SARS related coronaviruses.

What dilution is it effective at?

What would an ideal dilution carrier be? Distilled water?

The ph change within the cell could be used to trigger the breakdown of the adenosine+TEA making the environment inside toxic to the virus.

In my free time, I love studying ancient chemistry.

I read a work by johann Glauber , one of the first chemical engeneer called ""la consolation des navigants "". At one point he talks about ""spirit of salt"" aka HCl.

I know this author already covered the synthesis of HCl by distilling sea salt (NaCl) with roman vitriol (FeSO4,n H2O). The mechanism is pretty straight forward : the sulfate decompose into sulfuric acid and react with NaCl to produce HCl.

This mechanism is well known and still used today.

However in this work he talks about another way he makes his ""spirit of salt"". He takes clay and cook it into little bals. Once done he let them absorb a concentrated solution of NaCl. After that he dry distill the balls into a receiver containing water.

I must say I don't understand how salt could decompose into either Cl2 or HCl with heat just like that. I didn't saw any modern day equivalent of this mechanism. Also what difference could clay make compared to trying to distill a pile of salt (wich obviously doesn't work).

What do you think ? Is it theoretically possible or is it just another mistake in old chemistry books ? What is the mechanism behind it ? Could it be another compound that would have been mistaken for HCl ?

Say that my molecule has a LUMO of -2.5 eV. The LUMO, in this case, is lower even than the cathode work function, which in my opinion should lead to decreased electron injection.

The lab is ill-equipped for handling such hazardous material, and before we bring anything on site, I want to make sure we implement strong safety measures for storage, handling and disposal. The hydrazine in particular is concerning. 

If you have experience routinely handling amines, please share any safety pointers you can think of. 

Available equipment: 

* A dedicated base cabinet
* A dedicated flammable cabinet
* Fume hood
* half-mask respirators with VOC/n95 cartridges
* 37F fridge, but it's not in a well-vented area

Example: Morphine is not just an opiate; it is, chemically speaking, a base, independent of any effect it might have on the human body.  Morphine for human/animal consumption is usually conjugated to hydrochloric acid (producing morphine hydrochloride), sulphuric acid (... sulphate), or acetic anhydride (... diacetate, Heroin®), but any acid will do.  Even, for example, pentobarbitone (an old-school sedative-anxiolytic, normally sold as the sodium salt); if you heat up morphine with methylbutylpentylbarbituric acid, you'll get the Nembutal salt of morphine (a product that isn't marketed; it's just, well, for the sake of argument).  If you heat up morphine with gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, you'll get morphine oxybate (gamma-hydroxybutyrate).

The hydrogen carbonate ion is amphiprotic. So too is hydrogen sulfide ion, HSO3-. Another amphiprotic substance is the dihydrogen phosphate ion, H2PO4- (formed from phosphoric acid, H3PO4). In solution (as the sodium or potassium salt), H2PO4- tends to undergo both the following:

**H2PO4- + H2O ⇌ H3PO4 + OH-**

**H2PO4- + H2O ⇌ HPO42- + H3O+**

It is acting first as a base (forming conjugate acid, H3PO4) and then as an acid (forming the conjugate base, HPO42-), and is therefore amphiprotic.

With hydrochloric acid,

**H2PO4- + HCl → H3PO4 + Cl-**

With sodium hydroxide,

**H2PO4- + OH-** **→ H2O + HPO42-**

# Amphoteric vs Amphiprotic

Amphiprotic substances are a subset of a larger set of substances classed as amphoteric. **Hydrogen carbonate and dihydrogen phosphate are amphiprotic and amphoteric. On the other hand, aluminium and zinc oxides and hydroxides are amphoteric but not amphiprotic.**",0,2020-03-16 07:57:07,chemistry

I'm trying to understand how the reaction works, specifically, how does the pH gets calculated.

I understand that the reaction will sit in an equilibrium as neither are strong. I think Ka and Kb (or maybe pKa and pKb?) can be found for either the reactant or products, but that's about it. I know that the reaction will produce CO2 and sodium citrate.

My question is: how do you calculate the pH of the solution? Or, please point me to online resources where I could learn more about the reaction, as most resource only touch buffers (strong + weak) and not weak+weak

Tonight was the first time using the tea tree, and I may have accidentally mixed the two together. I reuse gloves to apply my ketoconazole and without thinking I used the same glove to apply the tea tree tonight. I added a few drops to the palm of my hand before using one of my gloves fingers to dab it on the ringworm. On the palm of my hand, I started to feel a burning/stinging sensation and when I looked down, I saw a bunch of little white spots. It was so weird! I’ve been using tea tree oil for other applications for years and this is the first time anything like this ever happened. 

The spots were pretty easily wiped away with a bit of carrier oil, so it was as if it was something happening *above* my skin and not a reaction *with* my skin.

The [WHO sanitizer recipes](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf) are a good place to start:  
  
- 93.7% ethanol 96%
- 4.7% H2O2 3%
- 1.6% glycerol

Isopropanol can be substituted for ethanol, but this is getting hard to find now. My only problem is that they do not include a gelling agent. The guide says this is for cost reasons. However, I believe gelled recipes are so much easier to use that the extra cost is justified.

Most of the OTC recipes that have been circulating rely on aloe vera as a thickener, which has subsequently sold out everywhere. Even with aloe, the resultant gel is pretty thin.

In my own experimentation, I have determined that carbopol-940 (something I have in stock) precipitates in 65+% ethanol using NaOH as a neutralizer. I might order some TEA since that [supposedly helps with high ethanol concentrations](https://pharmlabs.unc.edu/labs/gels/agents.htm).  
  
[Agar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JrevHbZyD8) has been tried. Protein-based gelling agents will probably denature so they are all out.  
  
[Chitosan 1% w/w](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20050182021A1) seems like a possibility. I'll update this post after some tests.  
  
Commercially it looks like one of the (many) carbomer product lines is used. Which one, however, seems to be a trade secret. Carbomer-940 is the only one available on eBay. Based on some other patents, I've requested a sample of Ultrez-10, but have yet to hear back.

Hi all, 

I am a first year chem graduate student. Due to circumstances involving a personal issue, I did not do well at all during undergraduate. I ended up having a 3.18/4.00 GPA  and slightly above average GRE scores. I did not get into any of my top 5 choices, but I did get into a grad school that was further down the list. 

Since I have been here, I have skyrocketed my GPA, even though I'm taking graduate level classes, and I am soon to publish my first first-authorship paper. The issue is that this department has zero work ethic. When I came to grad school, I was thinking of being constantly busy and everyone was going to have that same mentality of efficiency. 

I know my professor will be a strong leader in the field (winning multiple awards, lots of funding, collaborations, etc.), but I also know I can just as easily find a professor like that somewhere else. I'm considering getting my master's degree here and moving on to a higher tier graduate school with a better work ethic and reputation. 

What do you guys think? I've been anguishing over this for about 6 months now and if I stay, I'll be fine. It's just the big ""what if"" is scaring me. What do you think?",8,2020-03-14 10:53:42,chemistry

However the room also contains a different airborne vapour or gas, you can tell it is present because of say, it’s smell or it’s effect on respiration. 

How would you go about proving the existence of this substance and, if possible, identifying it.

I have thought of the following: absorption spectra, GCMS, solubility and PH, using specific sensors (e.g. CO can be detected with an electronic sensor) even old school animal based detection (e.g. canary in coal mine). The lower tech the detection method the better.

Just saw this, and am recounting how many times I have poked myself with a needle in the lab. Looks like 100μL of DCM can really mess up a finger. Warning: several NSFL images 

Here's my hastily put together TL;DR:

&gt; they both rushed into my office on a Monday morning at 9:15 am. The PhD student asked me, “Seb, Nicolas just poked himself with a needle and the finger looks weird, what do you think?”   This was the first stage of the injury - the picture shown above was taken roughly 10– 15 min after the incident.

\~ 2 hours later at the hospital:

&gt; After a surgeon evaluated the wound at 10:30 am, the decision was made that an emergency operation was required immediately. Nicolas was taken to the operating room, and this is when, from my perspective, a very long and anxious wait began. The surgery started at 1:15 pm and lasted almost 2 h. The surgeon had to remove all of the dead flesh from around the puncture wound and the area underwent intense cleaning to reduce the possibility of subsequent infection and gangrene.  To reconstruct his finger, a piece of skin was taken from Nicolas’s arm and grafted over the wound.  The [Supporting Information](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/acscentsci.0c00100/suppl_file/oc0c00100_si_001.pdf) provides an image showing the condition of the finger 18 h after the operation. A few weeks after the operation, the surgeon shared that on first seeing the injury he thought he may have had to amputate the finger because of the extent of the damage

I am on holiday and with all of the corona virus panic I decided to buy a thermometer to check myself while I travel. The only one I could find was an old school thermometer. I took the thermometer back to my room, but decided that since it was cheap, maybe I should check if it is accurate? 

How to do that? Simple, put it in boiling water and it should say 100 right? Clearly I'm an idiot because as soon as I put it an a glass of hot water the thing cracked. To my dismay I look down, and see a small (5mm ish) silver bead. I know enough science that Mercury can fuck you up, though I did recall that it had to be in its gas form for it to do big damage.

The drop was submerged, but because the water was hot i panicked that it might start boiling or giving off gas. I resisted the temptation to flush it, and instead jammed a bunch off tissue in the top of the glass to sort of plug it. I then turned on the extractor fan a few minutes later in an attempt to make a makeshift fume hood. I then put it in a plastic bag, and put it outside in the air.

When I checked the drop was still the same size and submerged. I didn't see any bubbles coming off it, so I figure if it did give off gas it wasn't that much (I hope). Luckily, the whole thing was contained in the glass, so no cleanup needed thank god.

I am mildly concerned if I could have been exposed to some gas from this while I ""chernobyled"" this whole mess. Is that likely, and given the small volume, am I at risk of mercury poisoning? Also, I need to dispose of this, and I was thinking of finding a large trash bin and chucking the whole sealed thing in there. I'm a hypochondriac, so unfortunately... It's not the best situation.

I’m currently a freshman as a chemistry major, and I wish to attain a PhD in chemistry or a closely related field like biochemistry, bioengineering, materials engineering, molecular biology, etc.

My question perhaps is aimed towards those who have gone down a similar path to the one in one. My question is such: how did you find the area of research you wanted to spend years studying, out of all of the wonderful and interesting things there are to study in chemistry and beyond?

I’m interested in so many different topics and fields that I feel lost trying to find an area that brings me that feeling of wonder and awe. I try reading some recent journal publications, but if there’s too much jargon or vocabulary that I don’t know, then it quickly becomes uninteresting but I feel that it’s unfair to judge them like that as well. A specific example would be most organic chemistry articles.

Any advice would be wonderful!

But how? If the electron is able to emit energy then there must be some lower energy influence. If the electrons absorb energy from its surroundings, wouldn’t it only take enough energy to make it neutral with its environment? If the energy around the atom is equal, the energy can’t be emitted can it? If it’s higher energy than the electron, it would absorb energy. My best guess is that the atom would have to migrate towards a lower energy environment in order to spit out the photon and return to ground state. ? I mean if the electron has high energy then it will move away from the nucleus and feel less influence from it right? I can’t understand how the electron returning to ground state results in a photon release because it seems to me it’s the other way around, it returns to ground state because it releases a photon.

Please excuse me if this question does not suit the subreddit. I couldn't decide where to post. r/chemistry or r/physics but thought posting here would make a bit more sense.

I've got about 2.1L of 100% isopropyl alcohol (I've used it to clean electronics) but since I have more lying around and hand sanitizers are getting very very rare where I live, I've decided to use some of the left overs to create 70% isopropyl alcohol. And yes. I am using distilled water to dilute.

Long story short, my starting concentration is 100%.

And starting volume is 2.1L

I want to make 70% alcohol using distilled water.

I've probably did my calculation wrong but I've mixed 900mL of distilled water to 2.1L of Isopropyl alcohol but I'm beginning to think if the calculation was right.

An answer I found on [**Quora**](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-use-water-to-dilute-99-isopropyl-alcohol-to-91) (written by David Belair) seems to back my calculation but I just want to be sure since my friend told me I should calculate this using mass not volume.

Is it recommended to use heating around 100 deg C to assist this and lose the CO2 or must I first acidify the reaction and then heat the reaction based on this [mechanism](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0040402018308019-sc13.jpg)?

I would assume that this can only work once protonated or else it just cannot give the ketone at all. 

If anyone can recommend the ideal conditions and work up I would be very grateful. 

Thank you!",1,2020-03-11 18:17:07,chemistry
9905,fh67lu,Good Representatives of Gas Elements in Tiny Element Collection?,"I’m putting together a periodic table project which involves encapsulating elements in resin, the maximum available space for each element is about 12x12x6mm which has made sourcing some elements quite difficult and I’m looking for suggestions on what to go for to get my hands on them!

Ideally, if anyone knows of a company or someone who would do small batches (10-20) of tiny ampoules of these for a reasonable price, that’d be my perfect scenario, something like the tiny 10mg ampoules of Sodium, Potassium, Rubidium and Caesium that are on the market.

Alternatively, I’ve been looking at representations of the elements to replace them, mostly tiny bulbs and electronics, but for a lot of bulbs this size, I’m struggling to find out if they’re in a vacuum or contain a gas, and when they contain a halogen, it’s hard to tell which one! For other things such as Oxygen and Helium, I’m really not sure at all what to use to represent them. If anyone has any thoughts or suggestions, I’m open to them.

For Iodine, I’m going to try and encapsulate pure Iodine, but I’m not sure how successful this is likely to be and a suggestion would be more than welcome!

The elements I’m struggling with are;

	• Helium

	• Argon

	• Nitrogen

	• Oxygen

	• Chlorine

	• Bromine

	• Iodine (maybe)

The ones I’ve figured out but would appreciate a better suggestion for are;

	• Neon (tiny neon bulb)

	• Xenon (tiny xenon bulb)

	• Krypton (tiny krypton bulb)

	• Fluorine (fluorite octahedron)

	• Mercury (tiny tilt switch)

	• Lithium (button battery)

For radioactive elements, I’m including mostly some uranium or thorium ore for each of them and the americium ‘button’ from smoke detectors as my Americium and Neptunium samples.

I’m quite aware that obtaining actual Plutonium (or anything beyond Americium) isn’t really possible, but if there’s something that would be a good representative of it or any of the others, I’d be interested to hear it, although I’ve ruled them all out currently.",1,2020-03-11 18:01:39,chemistry

I am in my final year of graduate school but was given the opportunity to offer a section of organic chemistry two for non major undergraduates this year.  Teaching has been fun, students have been patient, and I have learned a great deal about teaching. 

Normally students meet for out of class exams and those with documented needs take their exams at a testing center able to accommodate them. With a shut down of in person classes being pretty likely at some point, I am wondering how to best administer knowledge assessments during this time. Are timed online exams fair to students who might not have Wifi in their homes?  Any take home exam becomes a group exam and seems ineffective.

I am in contact with my university and with more experienced professors in the department and am sure general practices and advice will be passed along.  Overall, just some thoughts and was hoping to start a discussion or hear what others are planning.

9935,fh0464,Very strange issues with VWD,"TLDR: I'm asking if anyone has seen a similar issue with a VWD or DAD that's stumped me and all the scientists I work with (with probably 250 cumulative years of analytical experience). 

long story short I have an HPLC-UV-CAD instrument that's producing erroneous UV data. 100 injections into a 200 injection sequence, the UV chromatogram starts reporting random peaks of consistent peak shape, but at random retention's and intensities. CAD data is nominal. 

All evidence suggests these ""peaks"" are either artifacts, electrical noise, or simply the instrument reporting instrument-controller related test chromatograms instead of collected UV Data. This conclusion is based on the fact the CAD data looks normal (especially since its a universal detector while UV is selective), the baseline noise in UV is consistent with levels of noise produced by the A/D box (evidence that the reported chromatograms are not collected chromatograms), and the fact that the chromatography as reported by the UV channel is inconsistent with known and expected chromatographic behavior (interestingly, all peaks look identical although scaled differently i.e. peak shape and tailing factors are identical). 

We tend to think the issue is something to do with module communication (this instrument is plugged into two different interfaces running two different CDS's). I've attempted to reproduce the issue, and trouble shoot it in a variety of ways, undoing, redoing connections, changing cables and power cycling the instrument modules, but the issue comes and goes at random.

I was wondering if anyone has ever seen the same, or even a remotely similar issue. This is a cGMP validated instrument that undergoes PM and calibration every six months and performance parameters are rigorously tracked. If this was a non GMP instrument I'd just toss the UV module, but, considering the bureaucratic nightmare that could spawn, I'm trying my best to get to the heart of the issue.

The dry seaweed loses 80% of its mass upon calcination, and literature reports an ash content of 20% dry weight for this seaweed species, suggesting that nearly only ash remains. The highly oxidative treatment that follows should rid the sample of any remaining organic compounds, and what remains should only be the seaweed salts, along with chloride and nitrate. The presence of organic compounds may be an interferent in later stages, suggesting that the method is failing in removing them at some step.

Upon seeing the recent post about the student mixing some potassium dichromate with a few other chemicals to ""see what would happen"", because ""their teacher allowed it"", I think this question is worth discussing :


Are ""in-lab reaction"" posts well fit for this sub when there is an obvious lack of security measures in place ? Are they not encouraging dangerous lab practices ? Should they be removed ?


The post I cited above is just an exemple, but I think it is a good one. OP's obviously a young student, but ""removing the gloves to take the photo"", while manipulating dangerous chemicals outside a fume hood, in an open vial, directly above one's notebook is wrong on about every level of lab practices. 


I am a mere lurker in this sub, but I work in the field. I know that safety measures sometime are hard to follow well while still being able to work correctly. I too sometime keep the hood up or briefly manipulate without a lab coat, no bad faith here. My point is that this sub is kind of a showcase on the world of chemistry for a lot of laymens and students : we should not encourage dangerous behaviors.


I don't think we should enforce a very harsh policy on which posts are allowed, but a little discernment would not hurt. Is OP performing an acid-base titration of citric acid with the hood glass a little too high ? Or is he playing with a block a metal-Na above a faucet, next to a bottle of t-BuLi ?


I have recently been forwarded the images of the aftermath of an accidental injection of &lt;100uL dichloromethane. &lt;100uL is REALLY not that much, much less than what was in the vial of the above-mentionned post, although it is a very different chemical. Well, the images were unsettling to say the least.


Anyway, I think the topic is worth discussing, as ""you should wear PPE"" is amongst the comments I see the most here.

9985,fgmb6m,Questions about a Copper Zinc Battery,"So I know how a copper zinc battery usually works, with the copper strip, zinc strip, and their solutions, with a salt bridge. But what is the purpose of the solutions? And how does this work with a stack of pennies (primarily zinc) and nickels (primarily copper), with a price of paper towel or something soaked in salt water or vinegar? It is the salt water the solution or the salt bridge, or something else entirely?",3,2020-03-10 17:21:44,chemistry

9987,fgls5l,Calcium Chloride Anhydrous vs Dihydrate,"If I have a package of calcium chloride, is there any way I can determine if I have anhydrous or dihydrate. 

There is minimal to no information on the label that helps except saying that it is Food Grade. It is white and shaped like small balls with a rough surface. 

I use it to remineralize my di water for my aquarium, but I need to know the correct chemical formula to get the measurement right. 

Thanks!",2,2020-03-10 16:49:27,chemistry

Unfortunately had some traditional wood Ash on my hands. Was wondering what would happen if it were to be mixed with lead or mercury or cadmium salts and oxides that are very easily found in paints here.

.. Since it's Holi season, I reckon, they can mix easily with ash as a lot of people rub Ash on their forehead",3,2020-03-10 14:44:43,chemistry
