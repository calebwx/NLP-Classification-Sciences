ghkmwa,Synthetic Challenge #130," **Intro**

Welcome back to Week 130 of Synthetic Challenge. With everything going on the world, hope everyone in the community is safe. Hopefully this challenge will distract you while you're on a work from home adventure. Stay home, don't go to the lab!

Since the topic has been a bit on the downlow for a couple of weeks, I have decided to attempt revival with everyone's favorites, nucleic acid derivates.

Too easy? Too hard? Let me know, I'd appreciate any feedback and suggestion on what you think so far about the Synthetic Challenges and what you'd like to see in the future. If you have any suggestions for future molecules, I'd be excited to incorporate them for future challenges!

Thank you so much for your support and I hope you will enjoy this week's challenge. Hope you'll have fun and thanks for participating!

**Rules**

The challenge now contains three synthetic products labelled A, B, and C. Feel free to attempt as many products as you like and please label which you will be attempting in your submission.

You can use any commercially available starting material for the synthetic pathway.

Please do explain how the synthesis works and if possible reference the technique if it is novel. You do not have to solve the complete synthesis all in one go. If you do get stuck, feel free to post however much you have done and have others pitch in to crowd-source the solution.

You can post your solution as text or pictures if you want show the arrow pushing or if it's too complex to explain in words.

Please have a look at the other submissions and offer them some constructive feedback!

fgtovz,About the usage of PPE,"Hi everyone !


Upon seeing the recent post about the student mixing some potassium dichromate with a few other chemicals to ""see what would happen"", because ""their teacher allowed it"", I think this question is worth discussing :


Are ""in-lab reaction"" posts well fit for this sub when there is an obvious lack of security measures in place ? Are they not encouraging dangerous lab practices ? Should they be removed ?


The post I cited above is just an exemple, but I think it is a good one. OP's obviously a young student, but ""removing the gloves to take the photo"", while manipulating dangerous chemicals outside a fume hood, in an open vial, directly above one's notebook is wrong on about every level of lab practices. 


I am a mere lurker in this sub, but I work in the field. I know that safety measures sometime are hard to follow well while still being able to work correctly. I too sometime keep the hood up or briefly manipulate without a lab coat, no bad faith here. My point is that this sub is kind of a showcase on the world of chemistry for a lot of laymens and students : we should not encourage dangerous behaviors.


I don't think we should enforce a very harsh policy on which posts are allowed, but a little discernment would not hurt. Is OP performing an acid-base titration of citric acid with the hood glass a little too high ? Or is he playing with a block a metal-Na above a faucet, next to a bottle of t-BuLi ?


I have recently been forwarded the images of the aftermath of an accidental injection of &lt;100uL dichloromethane. &lt;100uL is REALLY not that much, much less than what was in the vial of the above-mentionned post, although it is a very different chemical. Well, the images were unsettling to say the least.


Anyway, I think the topic is worth discussing, as ""you should wear PPE"" is amongst the comments I see the most here.

I've heard that dealing with heat generated from nuclear decay in nuclear waste is a big problem, but I've been wondering if we can't just use that as a long-term power source?  I understand that there's probably two or three orders of magnitude difference between an active nuclear plant and all the world's nuclear waste in terms of thermal energy release, but even then 200KW-2MW is nothing to sneeze at, and while I haven't done the math, that actually seems like a conservative estimate.

Seems like evolution from a single cell organism all the way to being human involves billions of reactions  that decreases entropy. The response ive been given to this dilemma is that in reactions, the dissipation of heat is what still increases the overall entropy in the universe, while at the same time decreasing entropy on our own planet.

So I did an experiment on reversible and irreversible reactions via cyclic Voltammetry.

I have just submitted my last assignment as a replacement for the exams. I am already getting on the ball of looking at jobs, but I still have this voice in my head of pursuing a Master's.

My undergraduate is in a Bsc of Pharmaceutical Science, and ideally, I want to pursue a life in Analytical Chemistry.

There are a few courses that peak my interest (only a few as I live in Ireland with limited institutions), however, I am still unsure if I should progress. The undergraduate course was based a lot on Analytical techniques, organic chemistry, and other modules such as GMP and Pharmaceutical Validation.

In short, I want to know if continuing on with my studies is the right choice. In regards to science degree's, how much more beneficial would it be to complete a Master's? Would I expect it easier to find work with higher pay? Would I be the preferred candidate Vs an undergraduate who has now had a year of experience?

My aim is to create a pulsed solenoid  where I concentrate the magnetic field to a sharp point.   Why?  Oh, you know, mad-scientist reasons. 

We all know a solenoid exposed to DC current carrying wire around it has a field somewhat resembling my drawing in (A).   My first thought is that if I modify the solenoid material's shape to something like (B) or (C), I'll be able to concentrate the field flux to a much sharper point than what I can get with (A).  I also know there are limits to what I can achieve with (B) or (C) because at some flux density and material, the field lines ""leak out"" of the sides of the material and do not exit out the intended small circular concentrating point.   

Given the same current, turns, and volume of material:   in a general sense, what would work better as a concentrator?  (B) or (C)?   Something else perhaps?

I also know that in order to maximize the field, I have to give the flux a place to return ""close to"" where it exists to top/north in (B) and (C).    I have some ideas on geometries for this, but I don't know how to visualize the fields for these in-my-mind, arbitrary solids.  As to geometries, I  know how to create solid models and other mesh types in FreeCAD.  Are there any magnetics visualization software that is free to use ( my interest is non-commercial ) which would help me play around with and experiment with various geometries for this purpose, to see field lines exiting/leaking, and select parameters like material ( iron, cobalt iron, etc) , wire turns, current, wire diameter, etc?   Something I wouldn't necessarily require a PhD to operate ...

hauojl,Rhodium-phosphine bond distances in square planar and tetrahedral complexes.,"How would things like the trans and cis influences, ligand field splitting and backbonding affect the rhodium-phosphine bond lengths in the complexes shown below? The trans influence will cause the blue bonds to be longer than the pink bond. Would the pink bond actually contract due to the fact that it is trans to the water ligand? Or will both bonds experience lengthening where the blue bond just experience a greater lengthening effect than the pink bond? Then if you had to arrange the pink, blue and green bond lengths in increasing order where would the green bond length fit in? Will the P-Rh bonds in the tetrahedral complex be longer than both the blue and pink bonds due to the much smaller splitting of the tetrahedral complex compared to the square planar complex? would aspects like backbonding and spin have an effect on the bond lengths? This is a purely hypothetical question with hypothetical complexes. Both complexes are assumed to be diamagnetic.

and

What are the derived characteristics between the salamander and the pigeon?

hnmi42,Use of coffee in ICP-OES to absorb residual metallic elements?,"The post kinda sums it up. I’m an analytical chemist currently working in pharmaceuticals with a background in metals analysis for a major Zinc recycling company.
While working in the zinc lab, my head developmental chemist, who taught me a lot while working with ICP-OES, advised me to run black coffee through the system if I started getting internal standard failures or unusually high results on certain trace metals, as he said the caffeine in the coffee would clean residual metals out of the lines. Before you say “why not just change your tubing?” I know. But it worked a lot of the time when followed by a thorough diluent wash phase, and took less time than changing the tubes, breaking them in, recalibrating, etc. 
I’m curious if anyone can advise me on whether this has any validity, as my current lab is having some trouble with GFAAS and high Al results. One guess was that there could be Al contamination in the autosampler. Fortunately, we produce caffeine citrate for injection, so if the coffee/caffeine solution has any validity, then we could just make a pure caffeine solution to cleanse the autosampler lines on our Perkin Elmer GFAAS. I can’t find anything in any reliable literature using the trusty Google search, so I’m hoping you all could help me understand if this would be a viable solution to our problem.

Right now it looks like I'll be going to the University of Georgia for grad school. I plan on applying to their Integrated Life Sciences PhD program, and applying to a couple of Masters programs as a backup.

Most students in the UGA ILS program have a tuition waiver and a stipend in exchange for working as a research assistant or a teaching assistant. This pays a minimum of 28.5k a year I believe.

My first question to y'all is, since I obviously haven't started grad school yet and haven't experienced the life, is this enough to comfortably live on, or will I likely need a second job? If so, what would you recommend?

My second question pertains to a job during undergrad. I currently have 11k in student loans, but if I get a job once this quarantine is over, I can likely do my last 2 years without them. This is an attractive prospect to me, and I thought while I'm at it, I might as well try to get research or lab experience at the same time. Does anyone know of part-time jobs you can have during undergrad that would provide experience? I've looked into lab tech jobs, and most are either full-time or require a BS to apply.

I am in my final year of graduate school but was given the opportunity to offer a section of organic chemistry two for non major undergraduates this year.  Teaching has been fun, students have been patient, and I have learned a great deal about teaching. 

Normally students meet for out of class exams and those with documented needs take their exams at a testing center able to accommodate them. With a shut down of in person classes being pretty likely at some point, I am wondering how to best administer knowledge assessments during this time. Are timed online exams fair to students who might not have Wifi in their homes?  Any take home exam becomes a group exam and seems ineffective.

I am in contact with my university and with more experienced professors in the department and am sure general practices and advice will be passed along.  Overall, just some thoughts and was hoping to start a discussion or hear what others are planning.

I was watching a documentary that mentioned the expansion of space and its acceleration due to dark energy(?). At a certain point, space is will expand faster than the speed of light. 

Since the speed of light is the cosmic ""speed limit"" as it were. If space is expanding faster than light, then it seems to me that logically there should a way to move beyond the ""speed limit."" This is, however, where my limited knowledge ends.

Is there any way to manipulate this phenomenon? Would this allow for the use of travel without breaking general relativity? If so what would be required? If not, why?",2,2020-04-25 03:36:55,2,2,2,2,2

h0y0fn,Rose Bengal alternatives,"So a little bit of context,

I am currently doing an internship at a marine research lab as a chemist and have been tasked to find a suitable alternative to stain the macrozoobenthos samples with. They are currently using Rose bengal in a formalin solution (I believe 20% seawater with perhaps a little sodiumborate). This causes all samples to colour bright pink/red-ish. Sometimes the samples will not have colour at all making sorting them out kind of a pain. This is most common in samples with lots of sediment and clay.

I was wondering if anyone could help me find out how this colour comes to be or at least push me in the right direction of finding out. According to most literature I've read Rose bengal is pretty much always used for staining these sort of samples and I aim to find out why and see if there is indeed a better alternative.

hlguwi,Photon generation question,"Suppose I have a differential volume within which a stream of photons is being generated by means of radiative recombination in a semiconductor (i.e. just outside the depletion region of a p-n junction).  I know that the direction of emission is random:  if we assume that the volume is located at the origin of a spherical coordinate system, then the direction of the wave vector **k** of any emitted photon is a function of (theta) and (phi), with (theta) and (phi) as uncorrelated random variables each uniformly-distributed over \[0, 2\*pi).  In other words, this differential volume looks like a point-source.

My question pertains to the **phase** of the emitted photons:  I wouldn't think that the phase - i.e. the (alpha) term in the EXP(i\*(**k** dot **r** \- (omega)\*t - (alpha))) factor in the expression for the amplitude of the electric field corresponding to a photon - could be uniformly-distributed over \[0, 2\*pi), because if you sum the EXP(i\*(**k** dot **r** \- (omega)\*t - (alpha))) value over such a distribution, you would get zero.

So, my question is:  What is the distribution of the phases of the photons generated in this scenario, and what physical mechanism makes this distribution be something other than uniform over \[0, 2\*pi)?",9,2020-07-04 23:41:13,2,2,2,2,2

i959na,Question about potential effects of asteroid mining on Earth's behavior in space...,"Hey all! I'm a physics layman with a question. I apologize in advance if this question should be directed to another more specific physics sub or if this a repeat question. I searched the sub for ""asteroid mining"" but didn't see anything relevant.  

TL;DR - Could introducing more mass over time via asteroid mining and the way we distribute that mass across the planet have a meaningful impact on Earth's rotation, orbit, gravitational pull, etc...?  


As I understand it, the Earth's mass (and its distribution) is an important factor in many things including but not limited to the Earth's rotation about its axis, the Earth's orbit around the sun, the Earth's gravitational pull, etc... With the advent of asteroid mining on the horizon it made me wonder if there could be any unintended consequences to this really cool technological advancement. The first thing that jumped out to me is that we will be artificially(?) introducing more mass into the system. I understand the earth weighs something like 6x10\^21 tons while ejecting and accepting roughly equivalent amounts of mass every year without our help (I keep seeing \~50,000 tons in/out). I would think it would take an insane amount of mass increase to have any meaningful impact on the behaviors I mentioned previously. That being said, I once read online (so it must be true!) that the construction of the Hoover dam actually had a measurable impact on Earth's rotation (a small fraction of a microsecond iirc) essentially due to just changing mass/weight distribution of the land and even more so the water.  


It may take quite a while but barring any human intervention, such as deliberate mass ejections to help offset mass gains from mined asteroids (just the first potential solution that comes to mind), is there any meaningful threat to Earth's behavior in space due to a large increase in mass over many decades or centuries of asteroid mining? Would it matter how we distribute that new mass across the planet? Anyone know of a good paper or discussion on this topic?

g0q0xq,How to find Genes location relative to one another?,"Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project for an upper division undergrad biology class. For my project I'm trying to develop a method to remove a gene entirely. I know there are probably a thousand things wrong with this idea, and part of the project is to talk about all of them. The assignment was basically to come up with a potential cure for cancer, so obviously not many solutions we come up with are gonna be ideal.

Anyway, I'm trying to find the best way to determine what other genes are next to this one, or even better to find action sites for restriction endonucleases. I've really just been trying to look around on NCBI, but it doesn't seem like the best way to do it and I'm sure there's a better way.

I'm making tinctures, and I'm wondering about preservatives that can be used. I have heard of using:

\- Ethanol (Alcohol)

\- Glycerin

\- Vinegar

What about using citric acid as your sole preservative? (Diluted in water, of course)

I have done some googling on the subject, and I have only found recipies that include citric acid as a preservative, rather than solely citric acid. If vinegar works as a preservative, why wouldn't citric acid work too, as long as you get the pH low enough?

I was excited to get some cheap DCM so I set up a fractional distillation. Of course, I'm smart enough to do it in a well ventilated area and no better place than outside, right? 
Well, a thought occurs to me now that I've been sitting here for four hours maintaining my water bath at 53° C and staring at roughly 250 ml (so far) of what I hope to be usable solvent. There's probably a good reason DCM is stored in amber glass or brown plastic bottles in the lab. Don't judge me, I swear I'm usually smarter than this and think ahead more. Just got a little too excited to finally get my hands on some DCM, as I've had some projects on the back burner requiring it but it's really not worth it to me to pay the usual exorbitant shipping fee. 
I looked up DCM photosensitivity on Google and didn't find much, but the one article I did find relevant to what I was looking for makes me think I'm not going to be getting roughly $30 worth of DCM for the price of two year old paint stripper after all.

I took introductory chemistry and biochem 3 years ago... but we never went into how to use MS data for analysis (and nothing on NMR). I have a few questions I hope this community can help with. I find it's hard to discover simplified material that answers my specific questions while also being understandable.

1. Does a larger peak area in MS data mean there is a higher concentration of the metabolite? How about for NMR data? Is there even a difference in what the data from NMR and MS is telling you?
2. If you have a standard solutions made for a known metabolite that means the peak area generated for that metabolite can be converted to a concentration (this is my understanding, please roast me if I'm wrong). Let's say you have some metabolites with a known standard solutions that can be converted to concentration. Then you have some that don't have standard solutions and are left as peak area. Traditionally, a statistics education would says to simply standardize (subtract mean and divide by the standard error) each metabolite to make things no longer on unit scale. However, I'm not sure if that makes sense for peak area data as I'm not sure what a larger peak area value means. I assume this okay as you can think of the peak area as just some continuous value so I don't see why everything couldn't just be standardized and then analyzed.
3. Any general tips on how to pre-process metabolites before analyzing it when no standard solution is available? Even textbooks you'd recommend?

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I couldn't find the brush today and so opted to use an old scrubby dish sponge. I had been using this sponge for a while, so it was time to retire it.  


Unfortunately, I didn't think to rinse it thoroughly first, so there may have been residual dish soap inside. I have already rinsed down the bath tub walls etc. with some hot water, but I also sprayed some of the diluted bleach mixture onto the sponge directly in order to wipe down the sink. I did spray some clean cold water onto the sink to rinse it a bit and then let it dry.  


But now, I'm a bit worried that I may have created toxic gases. The bathroom does have a humidity fan, but it doesn't turn on unless it senses 60% humidity. At this point I have placed a Molekule air purifier in the bathroom with the doors closed, hoping that it pushing the air out the vent even without the fan running.  


Should I be worried? How long until it would be safe to go back in? Am I overreacting? I have a headache slightly and am a bit dizzy, but this happens any time I use bleach in there by itself. Sink seems to be dry already, just a bit of water left in the tub area.

hm2h0i,Are most people doing calibration curves statistically incorrectly?,"I am originally a Bioengineering major who had to take a bunch of chem classes and then later did an MS in Biostat.

One of the very basic things we learned in the beginning is that during a linear regression by OLS the errors have to be independent and also homoscedastic (ie have constant *absolute* error across the range).

However, in a lot of data that arises in analytical chem, this is not the case. First of all people using serial dilution invalidates this right off the bat. I’ve worked with chemists and advised them not to use this method unless they are willing to do Linear or Generalized Linear Mixed Models. 

But besides that usually in most instruments the error increases with the value itself. The usual way to deal with it is Weighted Least Squares or alternatively some type of Generalized Linear Model with a Non-Normal distribution like the Gamma for proportional errors (const relative errors)


With all the emphasis in the gen chem curriculum on sig figs and absolute vs relative error it seems bothersome that this is a glaring error in the chem education. The most common method used for a Calibration curve is actuallt wrong. Many papers about this but its still uncorrected.

Same goes for the whole Michaelis Menten Lineweaver Burke plot that is mathematically invalid. Inverting Y manually distorts the errors, and its best to do a Normal GLM with an inverse link or equivalently a Nonlinear Least sq model. 

Why exactlt is this stuff perpetuated? It seems like this exacerbates the reproducibility crisis. i’ve seen lot of data where in fact OLS and ANOVA are totally inappropriate to use. The thing is ANOVA is an special case of OLS so has the same assumptions. In some cases people have data below the LOD and its a non-trivial advanced statistical task to deal with it

Isn’t all this contributing to reproducibility issues?",2,2020-07-06 01:30:53,2,1,1,1,1

Title: New Weapons to Fight Antibiotic Resistance

Where: twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch

When: Thursday 7/16, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: The ability to manage bacterial infections with the discovery and development of antibiotics was arguably one of the most important advancements in modern medicine. This advancement is now being threatened by the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. New solutions are urgently needed and despite the fact that phage therapy has frequently been touted as one of those new solutions, there are no approved phage therapeutics on the market. Here we briefly discuss how we ended up in this situation and the key technical challenges that have prevented phage therapy from living up to its potential. We outline a path to overcoming these technical challenges and bringing phage therapy to the market as a powerful solution to help us manage bacterial infections and save lives in an age of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",6,2020-07-16 12:22:18,0,0,0,0,0

So I'm applying to a university in like a week or so and I'm pretty sure I'd like to do something involving chemistry. In fact, I've narrowed it down to the two (probably classic) choices: Chemistry or Chemical Engineering.

&amp;#x200B;

I've looked into both opportunities and all the info I seem to find all suggest the same thing: Chemists do stuff in labs and chemical engineers do stuff in factories. I'd like to do a bit of both maybe, I'm not sure, but I'd like to actually learn about chemistry and put that knowledge to use - maybe product design or idk - and the university of technology ( here's the link if you're interested [https://www.aalto.fi/en](https://www.aalto.fi/en) ) where I could study ChemEng is quite active when it comes to innovation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have no issue with maths or physics, I like them both a lot, but what I am afraid of is getting into chemical engineering and then finding out that it's really not that much chemistry and more of just thermodynamics and optimization of the Haber-Bosch process. I'd really like to be able to look at something and know how it can be used to make another thing - or to look at a reaction and know what happens and why it happens.

&amp;#x200B;

So I'd like your input. I know this isn't a decision you can make for me, but if you have the time to tell me about your career and education and what it involved or just comment some ideas on this topic, that would help me out a lot.

&amp;#x200B;

fd9zs0,Crazy thought on event horizon of black holes,"I finally got around to reading Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time and I quite enjoyed it, but I have had this thought since reading it.

Since the size of a star is determined by the force pushing out of the nuclear reaction within the star equalling the star’s gravitation pull. As well as other things on the atomic level such as the energy of electrons not being able to escape the nuclear forces, which would make up the size of an atom. 

Could it be plausible to think that when a star collapses to a black hole it creates its own spacetime region within the event horizon, and at the core in its spacetime is negative mass. Since entropy will be decreasing within the black hole which disobeys the 2nd law of thermodynamics, and would make time go backwards.  We cannot see it as it hasn't happened yet, so nothing is there, just a black hole.

Then the event horizon of a black hole is would then be where the force pulling in from its gravitational pull in our spacetime is equal to the force pushing out of the negative mass within the black hole’s spacetime. This interaction would take place in other dimensions, but we would observe the way we do.

In that case you could come up with all sorts of things about the event horizon, such as you cannot cross it in our spacetime. Perhaps when matter collides with it, it annihilates to negative energy within the black hole, or it goes off into imaginary time.

Crazy thought I know, but it keeps popping in my head. Bit of a different take on it than normal thoughts, where light just cannot escape.",5,2020-03-04 02:18:36,2,2,2,2,2

I am an electrician by trade, and only have a very basic understanding of galvanic corrosion. 

1. Does the galvanic corrosion of Tin/Lead/Copper ever cause a solder joint to fail? Will a solder joint of (lead-free) Sn/Ag/Cu joining two copper leads undergo any galvanic corrosion?
2. Do rosin fluxes still continue to corrode a circuit board after the solder joint is made?
3. Waterbased  plumbing flux cause too much corrosion to an electronic circuit and therefore  rosin based fluxes are recommend for a electronic circuit board. Why are water based fluxes (inorganic acids) okay on a plumbing fitting but not electronic circuit board?

However, my teacher gave me feedback saying to research if there is a nasal spray method that might be better because the solution might run out of the nose if it is not sprayed.

feu7hr,[Question] What causes these oscillations in sound waves?,"High school senior here, studying this just for fun.

I know that a sine sound wave is classified as being a pure sound, meaning that it oscillates at only one frequency (please correct me if I'm wrong). That being said, in the frequency spectrum shown in the image, a sine wave would be a simple line, which doesn't happen when I play more that one at a time.

As you can see, there are oscillations around the wave frequency line. What does this mean and why does it happen?

Note for my fellow musicians: I am playing a C, another C an octave higher, a G (its perfect fifth) and an E (its major third), which are C's harmonics. I figured this information might help.

Thanks in advance!

gjtsel,Electrolysis for a aquarium,"Hello everyone.

I don't know if they will be able to answer this for me, if this is the appropriate reddit.

&amp;#x200B;

The truth is that I tried to make a ""doctor chihiros"" that is supposed to be a device that by electrolysis would help inhibit algae in an aquarium.

I made a ""diy"" version of hundreds of videos on youtube.

&amp;#x200B;

It is very simple: two stainless steel metal networks are used facing each other, without touching each other, and they are each connected to a pole (positive or negative) of a transformer. This generates a lot of visible small particles.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, in the middle of the network, red particles began to be generated, with just a few minutes of use ... as if it were rust (for now ""stainless steel"" is not seen to be rusty ... if this is possible, but these particles are seen, which are then pushed by the same bubbles into all the water in the aquarium).

&amp;#x200B;

Rust is not good in an aquarium, it can kill fish, etc. So I would like to be sure of what is happening here.

Aquarium water is tap drinking water, which I also add calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate to to increase the hardness of the water (which is what my fish need).

&amp;#x200B;

I saw that this red is generated to several (in YouTube videos), although not many show it in the video where they teach you how to do it. What can this be red? Can I make this same device for electrolysis with two aluminum nets? If so, what kind of reaction could happen in the water? Would you change something to be aluminum?

&amp;#x200B;

I am Lorenzo, 22. I am currently studying Applied Biology at HAS University in the Netherlands and I am looking for an internship. I am originally from the Caribbean and I love the tropics (worldwide). So now I am searching for an internship in the tropics that fits the criteria provided by my university. 

In the Netherlands, places that provide quality internships are usually universities, commercial companies or private companies that focus on improving the agricultural sector. In my case everything that has to do with plants, ecology, animals and (growing) food. What we as students must do during an internship is to write a scientific report about a project or experiment that we conduct during our stay. Topics that interest me are; 

1. Improving crops by means of selection and genetic markers (e.g. seed breeding)

2. Discovering ways to a more sustainable form of farming (e.g. indoor farms, biological control) 

3. Finding ways to preserve precious ecosystems (e.g. the rainforest) and maintain (endangered) animal populations in the wild

4. Marine Biology and the preservation of marine life and ecosystems (e.g. coral reefs)

5. I am open to various other fields in biology which may not have crossed my mind or are still unknown to me!

If you know a place, company, university or family business that might be suitable and is open to receive interns, or maybe you have a contact in the tropics that could help me find one, I would love to hear from you!

Same goes for potential. Only when there's a difference in potential or voltage is there an energy movement. This can also be called as a disturbance in the order of universe i.e universe wants potential to be the same everywhere. Maybe it has got to do with entropy or something.

Hi guys, 

So I am a little bit confused on what's the exact difference between pluripotent and totipotent cells. From what I know, totipotent cells can transform into any cell type, and pluripotent cells can transform into any cell type except the placenta. Also I have been taught that you can create a whole organism from totipotent cells, but not pluripotent.

I don't get how though. Does it have something to do with the placenta?

Also, if totipotent cells can create a whole organism from one cell, does that mean that you can create a human being from these?

What happens to these cells as we age? Like are they still there? Because if so, then technically shouldn't we be immortal?

i8gs2g,Viability of self studying higher level physics,"I am interested in learning and being up to date with the frontiers of certain areas of physics but not just at the laymen level. I’d like to know the physics and mathematics behind it. For example, I was trying to learn about the unification of electromagnetism with the weak force and found that it was far over my head. I know this isn’t the newest research but it is modern physics and felt like if I couldn’t understand this then I’m even further away from what is being studied now. 

I’m not a gifted individual in terms of mathematics or physics, only curious. I’m half way through a master program in applied physics and although my career might take me away from physics it is still a subject I’m extremely interested in and will continue studying.

f52c78,Newbie Question Regarding Infinity,"Highly intellegent quantum physicists, who have obtained their PHD, state the following:

If the universe is infinite (many of them think that this is the case), then this infinite universe must contain every possible configuration. In other words, anything/everything that you think, exits in the universe. For instance, they will argue that their is a monkey in the universe who is currently writing Shakespeare.

I understand their argument from a philosophical outlook, but I have an objection.

I think their wrong, but I know that in actuality, I am wrong in thinking that their wrong; therefore, I am seeking clarity from someone who has a firm grasp on this concept.

Here is my hiccup:

Why can't the universe be infinitely novel and unpredictable? The quantum physicist says, well infinity contains EVERYTHING, but they use the word ""contain,"" and this word stems from a finite paradigm.

I understand how the infinite universe is infinitely novel, but I do not understand how it is predictable. Assuming a monkey is writing Shakespeare assumes predictive power. Again, the assumption is derived from the following proposition, ""infinity contains everything, even the predictable.""

fpchmu,Hot ethanol vapour and silicone joints in copper pipe,"tl;dr How does r/chemistry feel about hot ethanol vapour in the presence of silicone joints from a food safety perspective? Will the silicone leach in or weaken the joint over time?

---

Hi everyone, I distill my own alcohol and enjoy reading r/firewater. There seems to be a number of tables, charts and articles that explain that silicone and ethanol are fairly good friends. The firewater community seems rather against using silicone in place of lead-free solder to attach pipes together because hot ethanol vapour doesn't seem to be well regarded with silicone joints. Can y'all weigh in on that? The total area exposed to the vapour will be the space between the pipe and fittings, which is fairly small, but there are a dozen or so of them.


My eldest brother is a pipefitter and says great things about attaching metal using silicone -- he often has to use a pry bar to pull gaskets and flanges apart that have silicone in there. I expect to solder 3"" copper pipe together, but it's a lot for a propane blow torch to do, so I'll have to sweet talk (or bribe ..) my welder brother into helping me use an oxyacetylene torch to solder the pipes.",2,2020-03-26 09:32:56,1,1,1,1,1

[closed],"I have little experience with mathematics beyond single-variable  calculus, but I'm very curious about how physicists understand reality. I  like reading and watching popular science, but I always feel like I'm  being conceptually shortchanged: either the analogies are too vague  (gravity bends space just like a piece of tissue!), or else I don't  quite grasp where the concepts come from – how they were developed and  why they work. I'd love to go the long way and learn all the gritty  details, but that's a project for several years and I'm wondering if  there's a way to make a smart compromise. For instance: one can learn  what a differential is, or acquire an intuition for it, without going  through an entire book on calculus. What's the closest I could get for  other concepts, so as to help me make more sense from relativity and  quantum mechanics than what you get from Brian Greene and the likes?

How hard is it to get a permanent position as a G5 biologist? I honestly would study anything but i have the most experience with animals, and a fair bit with plants. A little bit of my background...
I graduated last year with a degree in animal science and a minor in rangeland resources. Since then, i spent 6 months working on the livestock side of a sustainable ranch (3 as an intern, 3 as a seasonal employee) and then 6 more months as a naturalist intern (though with the pandemic i only had students for 3)
I also have done a summer internship doing animal care at a zoo and volunteer experience at a wildlife hospital. Overall, i feel like i have a pretty decent resume. Maybe a little lacking on the actual data collection and management side of things. The problem, however, are my grades. I did not do well in college. I was not doing great mentally. 

With the forest service applications always asking for just a resume and you transcripts, no cover letter or anything of that sort, do i stand a chance of being hired anywhere for a permanent position? I understand i may have to look for internship/seasonal work but after moving 8 times in less than i year i would really like to stay in one place for a little while. Sorry for the long boring post

I intended to analyse the effect of pH on catalyse activity using potato and hydrogen peroxide. I had three test tubes: one controlled (10mL 6% H2O2), one acidic (5mL 6% H2O2 + 5mL 1M HCl) and one basic (5mL 6% H2O2 + 5mL 1M NaOH). I then measured the number of bubbles produced in these test tubes for each solution in cm. The answers were as followed: controlled - 0.9cm, acidic - 0.5cm and basic 0.1cm. I'm unsure how these results are even possible when upon research catalyse only work between 7-11pH and I had already predicted that the best outcome would be from the basic solution as H2O2 is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, producing a near-neutral solution. Any help or idea to what I am doing wrong would be appreciated and help as to what the true pH of each of these solutions are.

The sample is a semi-course black powder. I've tried acid digestion in hydrochloric acid, nitric acid and aqua regia. The nitric acid performed the worst and after heating turned faint yellow in color. The aqua regia performed slightly better than the HCl and after heating, both solutions were yellow/orange in colour. I suspected that the yellow color might be an indication of the presence of iron so I performed a quick test with ammonium thiocyanate. The solution turned dark red indicating the presence of iron.

My issue with the acid digestion is that I am getting a strange almost fluffy, transparent, gel-like substance that does not dissolve in the acid. I have a suspicion that this might be silica, but it could be anything. I only have access the HCl, HNO3, H2SO4 and H3PO4.

gdaoqb,I have two questions about Matter,"First, is it possible for matter to be at complete rest molecularly? By that I mean; is it possible for a substance, say gold, to exist molecularly assembled with absolute zero motion. 
An example would be akin to astronomy, as we draw a constellation by assigned stars into a pattern, would it be possible to take pieces of matter at complete,absolute rest and “draw”/“assign” a molecule of gold configuration?
I know nothing is supposed to be at rest, but if matter did reach an absolute, complete rest?

Or maybe a better visual is to take an existing molecule of cold and then strip it of the energy to stay attached but not in such a way to damage the structure. So, instead of disintegrated the gold by wrecking its structure but can you leave it in place and remove all of its energy?

The other question is since matter is conserved, is there a progression to that? Example if I lose a pound of body weight, does the matter I am no longer carrying stay in the form I lost it in or can it/does it change into whichever forms suit the loss?
Does water lost mean water,itself, gained or is it conserved by component? Molecules and energy?
What happens when energy slows down and becomes matter,  thereby adding one kind of “content” or when matter speeds up into energy?

These might be dumb questions, I don’t know. I was thinking how dark matter might exist and I had the tough that it is a form of organized matter that has no motion of any kind but still mAintains structure integrity.",11,2020-05-04 07:27:43,2,2,2,2,2
gamc2q,Epirium Bio EB- 002," 

I am 16 years old. My goals are to become an anesthesiologist and also to research future technological treatments for my muscle condition, Minicore Myopathy, which is a form of Muscular Dystrophy. My condition is non-progressive and I can walk independently though I have weak lungs and heart. I hope to be able to do research both in college and after to help find cures and developments for my condition. My disease doesn't get a lot of love in the research department.

I'm interested in this so much because I frequently look up therapies that are being used for other diseases but could also apply to be. While you guys are using this therapy for Becker's it could also apply to my condition. As the formation of mini cores on muscle biopsies in Minicore Myopathy has been linked to Mitochondrial absence or dysfunction. This treatment could help me tremendously as it would not only promote mitochondrial biogenesis in me but it would also promote other key proteins that are important in muscle growth and repair (Over-expression, a theory which I am currently studying). I would love to find out more about this treatment and if I can possibly use it in the future. This therapy has immense potential to help many Muscular Dystrophies, not only Becker's like you guys already know. This would especially help me out as my genetic mutation still hasn't been found so having something to overexpressed other genes to compensate for my unknown faulty one is good. I wanted to know if you guys knew about this and if it could theoretically work for me. Alright thank you so much for your work and stay well!

g5zpcj,How to calculate molarity of sulfuric acid,"We want to determine the actual molarity of an unknown sample H2SO4. Therefore we titrate the unknown sample with NaOH (1M, f = 1.002).

2 NaOH + 1 H2SO4 → 1 Na2SO4 + 2 H2O

Valid at the equivalence point:

2x #mmol H2SO4 = 1x #mmol NaOH

Suppose you titrate 20.00 ml H2SO4 with 11.00 ml NaOH. What is then the actual molarity of the sulfuric acid (in mmol / ml)?

molarity = n / V

V H2SO4 = 20.00 mL

How do i find n?

n NaOH = m x V

= 1 x 11 = 11 moles

and then 2x #mmol H2SO4 = 1x #mmol NaOH

so 11 x 2 = 22 mmole H2SO4

thus m = 22 / 20 = 1,1 mmoles/mL ?",1,2020-04-22 06:48:56,1,1,1,1,1

Now the 1st step is obviously the deprotonation of the alpha-hydrogen on the malonitrile, but the only mechanism I have been able to find shows water acting as the base to remove the hydrogen. 

Water has a pKa \~14 and H30 is \~0 but how can the product be a stronger acid than the starting acid? Similarly, the pKa for an activated methylene hydrogen is \~11 and though I can't find  a figure for the alkoxide it will undoubtedly be extremely high, so we also have the product being a stronger base than the starting base.

CN-CH2-CN + H20 &lt;-&gt; CN-CH-CN + H30

I feel like I am missing something fundamental here but I thought  that the equilibrium  would favour the weaker acid/base being produced, but I just can't that squares with the pKa values?

It goes like this: Rutherford designs the gold-foil experiment to see if the plum-pudding model is accurate. However, he realizes that if the plum pudding model isn't accurate, then it would statistically take an ungodly amount of time to see a result that would prove it. So he was like ""lol nope. Where are my interns/assistants?"" And then he gets Geiger and Marsden to sit in a dark room and watch the foil being bombarded for hours till an alpha particle gets deflected at a crazy angle.

f789hj,Water saturation in living space through humidifier,"Don't know if I'm in the right place, please delete if not.

I live in an attic apartment in a very old house (\~400 years old) that was renovated 1/2 year ago. The room height in the middle of the living room is \~4.5 meters. I calculated the volume of the room and came up with \~155m3. This is without the other rooms and will certainly not be 100% correct. Whether I close the doors of the other rooms or not makes practically no difference.

We use a [Venta LW45 CP](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-comfort-plus-airwasher?c=74) humidifier which can humidify 80m2 according to Venta. Venta states that the 80m2 are at 2,5m room height and so it would be 200m2. What exactly humidify means I can not say, but since according to various Internet sites, an air humidity of 40-60% in living rooms is given, I simply take 45% as an assumption.

I assume that the outside air also has an influence on how well a humidifier works. If it has only 30% humidity outside it will be more difficult to reach 45% inside than if it has 60% humidity outside, right?

With only the [Venta LW45 CP](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-comfort-plus-airwasher?c=74) we can reach \~35 humidity in our living room, if I additionally place an older [Venta LW45](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw45-airwasher?c=74) which can humidify 75m2 according to Venta we can reach \~38%, also an additional [LW25](https://www.venta-luftwaescher.ch/en/lw25-airwasher?c=74) which can humidify 40m2 according to Venta increases the humidity to only \~42-45%. The numbers vary, I think it is mainly due to the weather, if it is humid outside then they are higher.

So what can be the problem, does the humidity go away somewhere? Could the massive wooden beams in the roof ""absorb"" the moisture or is it the new plaster walls?

I pour about \~7 litres of water into the two humidifiers every morning and \~5 litres or more in the evening. So every day more than 10 liters of water will evaporate and we still have such dry air, what could be the reason? 1 litre water evaporated is how much % humidity in 155m3?

We have a super modern floor heating system in the apartment which can be controlled by mobile phone. We can make a heating plan and reduce the heat output even when we are not at home. Is it possible that the temperature drop overnight and during the day changes humidity?

Basically my question is whether the amount of water I add daily(\~10 litre) would not bring more than 35-38% into the room?",4,2020-02-21 02:33:49,1,2,2,2,2

go9kno,Question regarding expression of multi-subunit protein complexes,"Hello all!

I was doing some literature research (going to keep it vague unless further detail is needed). I am looking at if there are examples of certain protein complexes known to retain their function even without one or more of the usual subunits. For example, say most bacteria have complex protABC that does function X. I am looking for species that only have part of that complex, for example protAB, but can still do function X.

I read one study that found that a certain microbial group contributed a large amount to expression of only ONE subunit of a two-subunit complex, and there was no detectable expression of the other subunit. This contrasts with other papers regarding this protein complex which seem to always refer to the two subunits together, implying there are no known cases of them functioning on their own.

Would this alone be enough to validate a claim that this microbial group does not express/need that subunit, at least in the environmental conditions from which it was sampled? Or, are there likely other factors that could be in play that I am not thinking of that would make that claim invalid? Basically, could I put this microbial group down as an example that does not need/use the second subunit?

The paper was published two years ago and I have not found any follow-ups regarding the part I am interested in. The authors also did not make any claims about the subunits, they just included a table that showed no expression of the one subunit from this microbial group.

Hopefully this makes sense. Thank you in advance for any responses!",2,2020-05-21 20:08:38,0,0,0,0,0

heyj6f,Can dark energy alone can explain gravity better than the hypothetical bending of space-time in the general theory of relativity?,"I believe so, but I would love to hear any well reasoned arguments for why I am wrong.  


The first reason I believe this is Occam's razor. The simplest or least counter-intuitive explanation that is adequate is the best explanation. A theory of gravity that only requires dark energy is simpler and less convoluted than a theory that requires not only a hypothetical entity like dark energy, but \*also\* the inconceivable, hypothetical, metaphorical and invisible bending of space &amp; time that we have no direct evidence of.

&amp;#x200B;

The second is that neutrinos \*must\* contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe that without dark energy is contrary to the predictions of the general theory of relativity. Dark energy may also contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe while having a much greater total effect such that these two factors alone are enough to explain gravity without the general theory. In fact, the neutrinos we have observed may simply be large neutrinos, and dark energy may simply be made of smaller neutrinos, or smaller particles that are otherwise similar to neutrinos, that we have not observed directly, and can so far only observe as gravitational attraction and the accelerating expansion of the known universe.

&amp;#x200B;

When a large enough number of neutrinos travel through a large enough object such as a planet, some of the total momentum of the neutrinos is lost. This means that the neutrino field traveling though a moon of a planet after traveling through that planet has less energy than the neutrino field passing through that moon from all other directions. This means that the neutrinos cause a net force on the moon in the direction of the earth, making neutrinos at least one component of the observed amount of attraction between a moon and its planet, even if it's a tiny or negligible portion of the observed amount of attraction. The total attraction between massive objects created by known neutrinos as a percentage of the total observed attraction can be and should be calculated by scientists, but it may be only a tiny and negligible component of total attraction between massive objects. If so, and observed neutrinos are actually large neutrinos, and dark energy is the sum of all smaller unobserved neutrinos and neutrino-like energy, and has a much greater total energy than individually observed large neutrinos, this alone would be enough to explain gravity \*and\* the accelerating expansion of the known universe, since the total energy of the dark energy field and large neutrino field may be unevenly distributed, such that there is indeed a centre of all galaxies in the current galactic explosion that includes all known galaxies, and the only place where the neutrino field is roughly even in all directions is the centre of this intergalactic explosion, and such that this uneven neutrino field has a net outward energy at all non-central points of the intergalactic explosion, and such that this unevenness increases with distance from the centre of the explosion. (It is important to note here that Hubble's claim that there is no centre to ""the universe"", which he appears to have equated with the intergalactic explosion that all known objects are part of, was based on the fact that it is impossible for us to determine a centre simply based on the relative movement of galaxies. If he was referring to the intergalactic explosion containing all known objeccts, his argument appears to have effectively been ""We can't determine a centre of our intergalactic explosion. Therefore, there is no centre"", which is not a valid argument. In fact, if the dark energy  theory of gravity is correct, the directly measurable component of the neutrino field energy may have a non-zero net direction at all points of the intergalactic explosion except for the centre and this may reflect the degree and magnitude of the net direction of dark energy, which may allow us to determine that there is a centre of the intergalactic explosion, and determine in which direction and how far it is from ourselves). Since even the smallest observed neutrinos have been calculated to be at least 6 million times smaller than an electron, the sum of all dark energy and large neutrinos could also account for the gravitational force between subatomic particles, even photons, assuming that dark energy can exert force on photons. This could imply either that at least some neutrinos affect photons, or else that dark energy is made of something other than neutrinos, but with the same capacity as neutrinos to pass through large massive objects and transfer a portion of their energy to those massive objects.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that this dark energy theory of gravity is already a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity given the reasons I gave at the start, but there is a way to provide more evidence in the form of providing more accurate predictions than the general theory of the exact difference in gravitational force between objects of difference size. The iteration of the dark energy theory of gravity described here predicts that an object that is twice as massive will \*not\* have exactly twice the apparent gravitational pull, and instead will have slightly less than twice the apparent gravitational pull, as some of the energy of the dark energy has already been lost by the time it reaches the middle of the massive object. So if we can accurately estimate the mass of an object without relying on gravity, and find that the observed attraction is even a tiny bit less than would would be predicted by the general theory of relativity for larger objects or a tiny bit more than predicted for smaller objects, then that would prove even further that either the dark energy or neutrino theory of gravity is a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity. However, the difference may be so tiny that it is much smaller than the margin of error of our current methods and therefore not measurable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a theory I actually came up with in high school and it's one of the reasons I went on to do physics at university. But the physics instruction at my university was so unbearably boring that I transferred to other subjects for my second year. I only shared my theory with a few other people in high school and lost interest after I transferred out of physics. However, I am putting theory here in case those stronger and more determined than me in finishing a physics degree are looking for something to investigate, will choose this a a topic for investigation, and either prove or disprove this theory, or prove that it's less plausible or more plausible than the theory of general relativity as an explanation for both gravity and the accelerating expansion of the galactic explosion that all known galaxies are part of.

But the difference is so small that after 6 months there are still a few green leaves on there. And there is a lone krill/shrimp like creature surviving on what i thing is alge. I found this result pretty interesting so decided to make a second. And learn from my previous jar to hopefully maintain biodiversoty a bit longer.

But i only know the names of about 2 of the creatures in there.

Ill try to describe everything. DM me if you want to help me out.

2 slugs with a shell that looks like a spiral cone. Roughly 3 mm in length.

2 slugs that have a shell that looks like a rolled up rope, relatively flat.

3 brine shrimp

4 things that look like krill/shrimp. These are small but in my other jar 1 of them grew to a lenght of 1cm.

1 dead rainworm that accidentaly came in woth the soil 

1 tik like creature 1mm body, 2mm if you count the legs. It might be a tik but i dont know of they can sirvive underwater for 5 days.


1 thing that looks like a little leech. Roughly 9mm long and pretty much just flat and gray.

1 thing with a body shaped like an oval, 2 (legs) with broad(er) ends it uses to swim, brown.

fddw7y,What determines electromagnetic wave frequency?,"Hello. I’ve learned a bit about em waves. I always  believed that the frequency of the electricity solely determined the frequency for emitting waves. For example: if a circuit oscillates at 1 ghz,the em wave would also oscillate at 1ghz per second.

But I really didn’t think deeply about that. Now I’m hearing that the antenna length contributes to the frequency emitted. Well,I guess wavelength and frequency are 2 sides of the same coin. And antenna length is associated with wavelength. 

Can anyone clarify this for me? 

I also am very confused with 1/4 and full dipole stuff. I can’t understand how exactly this works. I look at things differently than many people. I don’t like using conventional methods,such as conventional current. I look at em waves as a bunch of photons oscillating in waveform(unless observed according to the double slit experiment,which then they’d be a point particle somehow... I think?) Well I can’t understand that if a photon is the smallest quantum bit of energy at whatever given frequency/wavelength,how does antenna length really relate to that for receiving? Multiple electrons or atoms don’t absorb and share a single photon. Does length have to do with a higher probability that the photon will strike an electron within that region?






Sorry if I sound dumb to you smart folks. I’m not smart at all. Equations will confuse me. I’m genuinely interested in learning how things work without extreme math stuff. 




Any helpful attempts to explain this to me would be greatly appreciated! I really hope someone smart can put my mind to rest.

I tried it 5 times but yellow oil always forms after staying on the bottom. I suppose this chemical wasn't stored properly because it's very yellow color (maybe some polymerization takes place). Do anyone know what can be an issue here? Or is it ordinary for NBu4OH?

I've found that I have no interest and passion, save for writing, in the media industry and I really would like to switch over to a life sciences field, particularly marine or wildlife biology. Research, conservation and education are my three main interests, and I'm looking at continuing my education in order to accomplish this. I could use some advice on which path to take, though!

1) I could pursue a second undergrad degree and essentially start over from scratch. Take a few remedial courses, get field and lab experience, network and move on to a graduate program afterwards (hopefully with a chance to have it paid for if I do well enough). It'd be less time than my last degree, and cheaper too. It would take longer than trying to go right into grad school, though, and from what I've been reading would do little beyond get me into the field. 

2) I could take remedial courses and get some kind of research experience so that I can compete for grad school somewhere. It'd be nice to not have to get another bachelor's, and I'd be more involved in work that would truly interest me I believe. I worry that I'd be missing out in valuable experience from the undergrad degree though, and would be at a disadvantage compared to more STEM focused graduates. I also doubt I'd get any kind of assistantship/TA position with my non-STEM background so cost would be a concern.  

Some have said that I should focus on doing science communications or wildlife media rather than go into research, but I'm not sure that's right for me. 

I realize that potential salary earnings in life sciences aren't that hot beyond getting tenure, and that's one reason I haven't fully jumped into this path yet. 

Any advice would be appreciated, can answer any questions yall might have!

I'm actually a french biology student (in developmental biology and stem cells), i'll  start my 4th year of studying and i have already done the second semester so i have a 6 months free period during which i'd like to do an internship in another country.  

I'd like to study organoids development  or cell therapy based on stem cells as i allready did this year and the thing is i don't really know how to find labs able to take me or interested especially with the COVID,

I’m not sure if this is the correct place to post this question, but long story short I had an old student of mine who is now in the 11th grade email me asking about audiobooks on chemistry and physics. This student was very bright when I had him in the 8th grade, but I’ll admit audiobooks are out of my wheelhouse (I’ve never listened to one). Are there any audiobooks that would be good for someone going into 12th grade or even on the level of a freshman college course? Thank you.",2,2020-05-12 21:30:25,0,2,2,2,1

I have always loved animals and when I was able to save a fly from drowning, I did so with pleasure. Growing up, I wanted to become a normal veterinarian. But know that I am 18 years old and that I know more precisely what I want to do in life.

But I don't know which pad to take to get there. I want to go around the world to save animals from unacceptable stages of captivity, protect their normal habitat and help conserve endangered species. And I want to do it for as many species as possible.

But I doubt that veterinary studies are really the best choice to get there ... So if anyone knows how to get there and if veterinary studies are the best thing to do or not in my case, I would really like to read your advice!",5,2020-07-15 13:17:35,0,0,0,0,0

gu2oqg,Yelp For Chemistry: Would Love the Community's Thoughts,"Hi All,

I created [https://scibase.co](https://scibase.co) a few years ago to help tackle the reproducibility issue in chemistry. Due to some personal issues unrelated to the site, I never got to spend as much time on it as I wanted. I never wanted to take the site down because I always intended to come back to it, but life intervened. It's now been a few years and - because it costs me a reasonable amount of money to run and maintain - I either need to push forward with it, sell it, or shut it down. 

While I spent a lot of time and money developing it and believe there's some really good/useful functionality there, if folks don't find it useful and/or have some specific suggestions on how to quickly and easily make it useful, then I'll probably shut it down.

If any of you are interested, I'd love for you to take a look and give me your honest feedback. *Keep in mind that the site is a bit old now so some of the functionality probably doesn't work correctly any more (for example, the browser plugin).* Keep that in mind when taking a look.

My ultimate goal would be to make it useful enough for people to actually use and contribute to - any ideas to that end are welcome. The ultimate metric I'll be using to decide where to shut it down or not is the number of reviews that are getting posted.

Thanks,

Brendan

glv2tw,Doubt in Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology course content,"Hi All

I am currently going through Prof. Robert Sapolsky's Human Behavioral Biology lectures on youtube: 
[Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNnIGh9g6fA&amp;feature=share)

I'm finding it very informative. But at the same time I have some doubts, so I was wondering if there's a forum for the same. It'll be great if you can share any discussion forum where I can post the doubts.

One particular doubt I have is based on the 3rd lecture, where he talks about infanticide in species other than humans. What I was wondering, is that if a female is already pregnant or nursing a baby, and then some male (not the father) comes along and kills the baby and impregnates the female with his sperm and leaves to impregnate other females. How does this system sustain itself, since now other male can come and kill the baby and this cycle just keeps going. Where does this cycle end?

Please let me know if more info is required from my end for you to answer this question.

Thanks",21,2020-05-18 00:06:41,0,0,0,0,0
ft2lfi,Is this a different take on Grand Unified Theory?,"Full  disclosure I'm not scientist but I do enjoy reading up on this stuff so  it's likely I just don't understand the subject matter but nevertheless  I would love to engage in a thought provoking conversation.

My  understanding of Grand Unified Theory is essentially there was one  force that broke into Gravity (the weakest of the four fundamental  forces) and ElectroNuclear force.  ENF then Broke into ElectroWeak  Interaction and Strong Nuclear Force (the strongest of fundamental  forces).  ElectroWeak then broken into Weak Nuclear force (second  strongest fundamental force) and ElectroMagnetism (the third strongest  force).

My thought is that since  these forces continually get weaker and weaker the more they break  apart, wouldn't it make sense that Gravity is the derivative of  ElectroMagnetism?  Or is there a justification to this anomaly?",5,2020-04-01 11:06:26,2,2,2,2,2

I know that we create laws/theories/ideas to illustrate and measure how the universe works, but why does it work in that way in the first place? If the universe was a game, why are the rules set in the way they are?

[**Seeing the Unseeable: Capturing an Image of a Black Hole**](https://april.aps.org/program/seeing-the-unseeable-capturing-an-image-of-a-black-hole/)  
Black holes are cosmic objects so small and dense that nothing, not even light, can escape their gravitational pull. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) captured a photograph of a black hole—a new milestone in scientific history. How was this accomplished? Watch the public lecture to find out from Dr. Sheperd Doeleman, the director of the EHT project.

The lecture will go live on **April 18, 2020 at 7:00 p.m. ET**.

Hello, when I got my blood tested for the type during my second pregnancy it said that I have O+, however both my parents have A+ (as far as they know), and I had always tested as A+ before. In order to confirm that I do in fact have O+ now, I did the test 6 months after giving birth and it still came out as O+. Does anyone know why and how it could have happened. I never had bone marrow transplant, malignancy, blood transplant or any autoimmune diseases. I only had a plasma transplant(it was my own plasma) when I was 16, I am going to be 39 this year. So, if anyone has any ideas or knows about why it would have happened, I would love to know.

I've recently struggling about a simple problem which includes the bernoulli equation. I have just basic knowledge about hydro mechanics from my physics class, so it's possible that i misunderstood the concept of bernoulli's equation which leads to my errors. I just want to understand were do i make my mistakes in the statement. So, my concrete question is why is the hydraulic power not equal on both sides of a tube (the bigger and smaller one). In this problem is not included static pressure, the smaller and bigger side of the tube are on the same height. The hydraulic power that a pump delivers through a tube is equal P=Q(flow) *p(pressure). Since the flow is always the same on both sides, Q1=Q2, but the pressure decreases on the smaller side, p1&gt;p2, which leads that the output power flow on the smaller side is smaller P2=Q*p2, which is impossible. I understand that bernoulli's equation states that the sum of all input energy has to be equal in all points, but why does that not work with power flow? I know that the power consumption is calculated by the pressure difference as P=(p1-p2)*Q, but that still does not makes sense with my concept of understanding, so i definitely do make mistakes but i don't know were. I hope you can help me with my struggling. My English is not my first language so i apologize for my bad grammar.",1,2020-05-27 10:28:10,2,2,2,2,2

hb3qic,"Brainstorming ideas for removing ammonia smell from cat litter. Nontoxic, solid acids?","Apologies if this isn't a good place for this, I'm working toward an education in chemistry and thought it would be best to tackle the problem from a chemical approach.


So, despite cleaning it out often, my cat's box always REEKS of ammonia unless I replace all the litter. Doesn't matter how well or how often I clean it, the smell never seems to go away. 


My first thought was to toss baking soda into it on the off chance it would reduce the odor by forming ammonium sodium carbonate with ammonia gas. That did not work. My next thought is some sort of stronger acid/base reaction with a solid acid that won't harm the cat. Boric acid is pretty mild, mild enough to be used in eye drops and doesn't absorb much through the skin, but is toxic when ingested. However, it will neutralize ammonia incredibly well (as a Lewis acid, not just a Brønsted one). My only concern is, would the contact the cat would have with the litter be enough to be toxic? I'd think just with his paws wouldn't affect him, but I don't want to take a risk.


Does anyone have any other ideas for relatively nontoxic solid acids I can use? Maybe stearic acid finely ground? I can reacidify all natural soap, obviously anything with SLS or other sulfonate soaps are out of the question, but good old fashioned lye-and-lard soap. Remove the glycerin, dissolve remaining sodium stearate/alkanoate in water, reacidify with HCl, stearic acid should fall out of solution. Mix liberally with litter, it should form ammonium stearate on reaction with the ammonia gas. Totally harmless to the cat. 


I don't want to spray vinegar or phosphoric acid around his box, sure that would neutralize well but it would smell bad and discourage him from using it.


I can't seem to find a litter that handles the smell, and I can't exactly afford to give him a brand new pan of litter every day. I already clean it every day or every other day, and even fresh after cleaning it smells.  Any other ideas on non-toxic odor removal?",13,2020-06-17 19:21:43,1,1,1,1,1

fdv8qs,[Grade 12 Biology: Bacteria and virus] Help me with this question please!,"1. Describe how a virus proliferates and spreads, and explain as thoroughly as you can why a doctor does not prescribe antibiotics against these invaders.

A virus propagates by entering a host cell. It starts by the virus attaching to the host cell and then enters it, then the virus releases its nucleic acids in the form of DNA to initiate replication. We then go into the process called protein synthesis when the virus needs its new proteins. We thus have virus propagation by forming new virus particles called virions. For plants, the process occurs by the virus entering its host (the plant) through a hole in the cell wall, and this can have several causes such as insect damage. Similarly, this happens in humans as well, and many died during the First and Second World Wars due to viral infection that spread through injuries to the body of the war and there were no cures for these diseases either.

The doctor does not prescribe antibiotics for viruses because it is used in cases of infections with bacteria and fungi, however, it has no effect on viruses. Viral infections can in most cases be treated / prevented with vaccine agents. Another side effect of treating with antibiotics is that we get bacteria that are resistant to the antibiotic, which makes it much more difficult to treat an infection. Once the body gets too many resistant bacteria against the antibiotic, this can be passed on to other people and then there are certainly big problems to get rid of this infection.

One reason why doctors also doubt about treating with antibiotics is because the body has bacteria that go into the normal flora category and help the body against infection and degradation of our food. When you take these antibiotics, the body will lose these benign bacteria.",2,2020-03-05 07:28:27,0,0,0,0,0

I get that spin exists in all direction before it's observed, and it collapses into only one when it's observed.

However, in the case of schrodinger's cat, everyone says that the cat's both dead and alive before we open the box, which has nothing to do with observing particles.

So I always thought that schrodinger's cat was just a fun story for children and people who never studied science, but recently I noticed that professors also say that the cat's both alive and dead before we open the box.

""This got Einstein wondering whether the transformation that preserved the structure of Maxwell’s equations was merely a mathematical trick or whether there was something fundamental about it. He wondered whether time and space were absolute, or whether the principle of invariance of the laws of physics should be paramount.

In 1905, Einstein decided that it is the invariance of the laws of physics that should have the highest status, and postulated the principle of relativity: that all inertial frames are equivalent, the observer’s motion (with constant velocity) is irrelevant, and that all laws of physics should have the same form in all inertial frames.

Hello folks, I am 23 years old in the San Francisco Bay Area. I still live at home. I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Microbiology with a Minor in Chemistry, my GPA is average. My parents helped me pay for college and I have no debt. My parents' family income is high even for this area.

 At first, I thought I wanted to be a doctor, but by the third/fourth year of education, I decided that I would not pursue that. At that point it was too late to change. I am thinking of becoming a scientist/researcher. I have no experience in the industry. I am struggling to find a job here. In order to get more options or find better jobs, I would have to get a Masters or a Ph.D. 

In general, I am would like to get to work ASAP and move out and start living. 

I am open to changing careers, particularly Computer Engineering even if it means starting over. 

I am willing to work for a few years make some money and go back to college for another bachelor's in Computer engineering.

Some of my questions are:

Should I focus on getting a job in this industry? 

Should I pursue even more higher education? 

Should I try to get a second bachelor's?",5,2020-06-08 17:23:27,0,0,1,0,0

I read somewhere that measles was considered one of the most contagious airborne viruses and the coronavirus is more contagious than even that. Reasons for this include its ability to rapidly multiply in the throat in a very short number of days which leads to spreading the viral load and also that the viral load contained per sneeze droplet on average was also extraordinarily high. In conjunction with the fact that the virus also has a random (and possibly quite long) number of days before someone may show symptoms (2-14 days) or even if they show symptoms at all, all the while the person remains potentially infectious to others, is this as bad as a virus can get in terms of spreading quickly?

Of course, it can be reasoned on the other hand that of in fact the virus had like a 95% kill rate it wouldn't spread very much at all because word about something with a death rate that high would stop it (more or less).

I was basically wondering what type of projects I can do on my own time now that I'm on summer break that can actually be useful and pertinent for my CV, and also something that can potentially get me more involved in chemistry (I'm aware that there's not much a student my age can do alone that will be revolutionary, but something interesting requiring me to learn more than I know now).

I know most side projects in science require skills in coding, which is why I started learning Python but I saw that most computational chemistry-type side projects are done on C++ rather than Python, but I'm not too sure.

Consider a uniform charged cylinder which statement to apply Gauss's law holds true

1. The cylinder is infinite and the gaussian surface is finite
2. The cylinder is any length and the gaussian surface is smaller than that length.

Personally I would say it is 1, the gaussian surface can be infinite but that was not given the cylinder has to be infinite otherwise you would need to use coulombs law to consider effects on the edges of them, however if I take a cylinder of 2 m and take the gaussian surface equals 1nm we would assume the cylinder to be infinite.

fqks4i,SARS-CoV 2 and long term implications,"Hello,

I’ve just been recently debating when things will return to normal.

I think the only viable option that gives us a shot at returning to normal life is effective prevention/treatment.

As for prevention, that seems nigh impossible. Incubation periods of a respiratory illness spread via small aerosol that has periods up to 49 days in outliers is insane and makes me worry about any containment/normalcy in the next year.

So far the deadlines of the disease by itself doesn’t seem dangerous, but it’s transmission is worrying.

So what if you don’t die during this circulation - it’s so contagious paired with reports of infection via the already multiple existing strains is worrying too.

This is a jumbled post, I went down a rabbit hole of studies that aren’t being talked about because of the implications they have of the severity, but so far from what I see about

A) reinfection 

B) incubation 

C) the nature of the virus - has some of the same components that makes a HIV vaccine challenging

D) long term damage 

We are going to see billions of people directly effected by this virus in my own personal opinion.

I’m interested to hear anyone else who shares my sentiment, after reading early studies coming from China about the actual nature/biology of the virus in early January I came to the conclusion it would be like this in America but not as bad as it is currently.

I know this goes against the general opinion and I very would could be wrong - but this is going to be long, and devastating to society. 

The consensus with many in academia is that this virus isn’t a major disruption to society, I’d argue everyone in power is shouting that because they realize the potential this virus has to destabilize a lot of what we take for granted.

I don’t think this is a doomsday virus that kills the world in any way shape or form, but from what I’m seeing I think this virus is going to have serious long term implications for our world.",0,2020-03-28 09:05:53,0,0,0,0,0

Interestingly, cinchona bark is not regulated and is sold widely online.   Apparently quinine is an active ingredient in gin and tonic, and there are complaints online that custom-made syrups from cinchona bark deliver up to twice as high as dose of quinine as is allowed under regulations for gin and tonic.     High doses of quinine can be fatal, so it was a surprise to me that it's herbal source is not tightly regulated.

Would dosing of quinine be any more predictable starting from a tincture of conchina officinalis rather than from cinchona bark?   One tincture of conchina officinalis lists whole plant extract of 400 mg and herbal equivalent of 2000 mg.   What does that imply relative to the amount of quinine that might be in the product?   That could be expressed as a range of doses given the imprecise nature of the source.

This post is not a recommendation to take any drug or herb.   Personally, I think you would be crazy to self medicate with anything like this.  I am simply expressing a pure curiosity about chemistry and how to calculate the dosing of an herb.",0,2020-03-28 02:40:56,1,1,1,1,1

I've been wondering about this for a long time, and there's no better time than right now to ask what the survivability rate is for pathogens on different non host objects. 

Fruit and vegetables shouldn't be washed the way you properly wash your hands. An orange will do well, but lettuce will be ruined. Seeing as Listeria and E. Coli can travel all the way with vegetables, what's the chance of getting infected by the flu or Listeria by the person handling your Iceberg? 

If someone infected with the pathogen touches an inorganic object made of plastic, metal or wood, how long will these pathogens survive on their own? Will a low temperature extend or reduce their lifespan?

gy4h78,Why can't we reuse mask?," 

I've always ""knew"" that I should either use disposable mask, or sanitized them after every use. It's a very rooted educatoin as I survived SARS in Hogn Kong. Then I heard the opinion of someone else and logically, it seems like they are correct. And I am very confused right now.

We don't need to wash mask because virus, like COVID-19 needs a host to duplicate. So even if there is a few COVID-19 on there, they won't be able to duplicate. After say... 30 days, they will just starve to death. So reusing unwashed mask have a very low risk as the number of COVID 19 will remain few on the mask as they don't duplicate.

I could not argue with that logic. That got me thinking though, wouldn't that apply to all pathogen?

As a mask is not the ideal medium, wouldn't all pathogen be unable to duplicate much on a mask? Say if we were to soak the mask in some salted water first, wouldn't that hugely decrease the amount of pathogen who can survive being on the mask? And if we were to never wash the mask, would the waste product of the mask eventually makes whatever is living on the mask uninhabitable?

This not washing mask logic defied everything I have been taught. Please counter this logic.",8,2020-06-06 21:44:35,0,0,0,0,0

I am unsure what to think?,"I’ve asked a similar question on this subreddit before and everyone has been very helpful so I’d like to ask for some advice in regard to how to interpret these results. The theory of the study is that these results suggest oxidative stress which can cause cancer.

Study:

Introduction: The present study aimed to assess the levels of salivary enzymes, protein and oxidant-antioxidant system in young college-going cell phone users.

Materials and Methods: The cell users (students) were categorized in to two groups – less mobile users and high mobile users, based on the duration and frequency of cell use. Unstimulated whole saliva samples of the volunteers were analysed for amylase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehdye (MDA) and glutathione (GSH).

Results: High mobile users had significantly higher levels of amylase (p = 0.001), LDH (p = 0.002) and MDA (p = 0.002) in saliva, when compared to less mobile users. The marginal decrease in salivary total proteins, GSH and flow rate were statistically not significant (p &gt;0.05).

Conclusion: Significant changes in salivary enzymes and MDA suggest adverse effect of high use of cell phones on cell health.

Every time a measurement is made and the wave function collapses this collapse is ""informed"" to all other subatomic particles in the universe. 

Entanglement could also be thought of having a third party included like our consciousness. Each time we make a decision, we associate the different outcomes to either a ""good"" or ""bad"" outcome. If I was God, I would be connected to this part of consciousness to better determine whether someone deserves to go to hell or not;  If our experiences in the universe were to be directly connected with one another as one neural network and adapt to us the same way we adapt to our environment, being able to determine who deserves heaven and who doesn't would ultimately be determined by the decisions and actions we participate in and what we associate them with. 

Ultimately, this thought experiment conforms by all the rules of quantum mechanics and everyday physics. Newton's third law of motion of every action resulting in an equal opposite reaction would be held true by the collapse of the wave function whenever we make a decision. The collapse of the wave function on all associated particles triggers a reaction by all the particles affected by this collapse creating a chain reaction throughout the whole universe that can be thought of as a tick rate. Every time the wave function collapses and the entangled particles settle for a result; the result is recorded in a third entanglement which we can call the memory of the universe. 

The universe as well as us humans is a product of self-learning and adaptation. The further we dig into the most complex rules of quantum mechanics the easier it becomes to understand how the universe has evolved into what it is today and how consciousness and memory are at play. 

If we think of the universe as a simulation and us the participants as the subjects of such; then there must be a reason to our existence. Due to the way our consciousness is entangled to the universe around us, finding or creating a reason to our own existence is entangled to our future and therefore exposes the illusion of free will. 

Accepting that free will doesn't exist and that our existence has a purpose that we have yet to understand is the best way humanity can move forward. We must evolve and throw away everything that we determine is bad for us humans as it as well is bad for the universe; this makes sense due to the way we have consciously given it this value.",0,2020-03-07 15:42:38,2,2,2,2,2

fzd2pa,"No, mixing alcohol and bleach doesn't produce copious amounts of chloroform.","I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but the bots on r/YSK removed this because they think it's about coronavirus. Regardless, I think that r/chemistry would appreciate the work that I put in writing this. Feel free to share with anyone.

With the novel coronavirus going around, people are getting desperate trying to find newer and better ways to clean. It seems a common mentality is ""if A is a good cleaner and B is a good cleaner, mixing A and B must produce a SUPER cleaner capable of even more."" Just look at the recent TIFUs and you'll see that in the past couple weeks there's been plenty of people mixing bleach and ammonia. Most people know that mixing bleach and ammonia is bad and makes toxic gas, but now new information is circling the internet that mixing bleach and alcohol produces chloroform. Perhaps the best example is in a [new TIFU post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/fz4t5g/tifu_by_accidentally_making_chloroform/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). Some people are in disbelief while others are accusing OP of sharing the recipe for chloroform. I hope to clear a couple things up in this post. 

**1. First off, it is never a good idea to mix household products unless instructed to do so.** The combination of A and B is not usually a better cleaner. In fact it is often worse because of unintended chemical reactions, such as the mixture of bleach and ammonia which produces toxic chloramine. Even if your reaction doesn't produce toxic products, you can still neutralize one or both of the original cleaners, causing inactivity. A good example is the combination of drain cleaner (very basic) and toilet bowl cleaner (very acidic) to produce a neutral salt. Not to mention, such reactions can be dangerous in and of themselves because they tend to be exothermic (meaning they get very hot, and may boil or splatter unexpectedly). Therefore, I strongly recommend doing some research before mixing any household products. 

**2. Not all alcohol is the same.** Two different types of alcohol are frequently used in sanitizers: isopropyl alcohol and ethyl alcohol. They differ by the number of carbon atoms in the molecules. Isopropyl has three carbon atoms, and ethyl alcohol has two. Before chloroform can form, the bleach first must oxidize the alcohol to form a carbon-oxygen double bond. When ethyl alcohol is oxidized, it forms acetic acid, which is in vinegar. This will not lead to chloroform. Isopropyl alcohol, because of the arrangement of atoms, cannot be oxidized into an acid. Instead, the oxidation forms acetone, which is found in nail polish remover. Acetone further reacts with bleach to form chloroform. So to summarize: bleach reacts with both types of household alcohol. In neither circumstance do you make a better cleaner, but the reaction will only proceed to chloroform with isopropyl alcohol. 

**3. The haloform reaction is VERY exothermic.** The reaction by which bleach transfers chlorine to acetone and produces chloroform releases tons of heat. When the haloform reaction is done in a chemistry lab, it is usually done on ice. Without ice it can get incredibly hot and can boil without warning, splashing you with hot bleach. I'd argue that the biggest hazard when mixing bleach and alcohol is this heat, not the chloroform. 

**4. After all that, you really only make a teeny-tiny amount of chloroform!** I think this is perhaps the biggest misconception. It's easy to imagine someone mixing a gallon of bleach and a pint of alcohol and BAM they have a bucket of chloroform to take out their enemies. This can't be further from the truth. What they actually end up with is a bucket of saltwater and alcohol with maybe a teaspoon of chloroform in the bottom. The reason: chemicals only react in specific proportions. In order to oxidize one molecule of isopropyl alcohol to acetone, you need one molecule of bleach. Then, for the haloform reaction, you need three more molecules of bleach. That means that four molecules of bleach are needed for every molecule of alcohol. The issue is that bleach is super dilute. There isn't enough bleach in bleach to make this reaction efficient! It's like baking: if you had twenty boxes of cake mix, but only two eggs, you can only make one cake! So, according to some quick calculations, one teaspoon (5 mL) of isopropyl alcohol requires 300 mL (1.25 cups) of fresh bleach. If the reaction doesn't go to completion you can get chloroacetone which is quite irritating to the eyes. So according to the math, you're going to need many gallons of bleach to make any sizable amount of chloroform, so much that you'd probably look suspicious buying it.

**So, to recap: No, you're not going to put yourself to sleep by mixing bleach and alcohol**, so don't freak out! The biggest hazard is the heat formation, which can be mitigated by keeping everything cold.  However, there is **no reason to do it because the reaction consumes the bleach** which lessens the disinfectant nature of the mixture. Just **don't mix any cleaners unless you've done the research first!** Be safe everyone!

heyp3u,Can dark energy alone explain gravity better than the hypothetical bending of space-time in the general theory of relativity?,"I believe so, but I would love to hear any well reasoned arguments for why I am wrong.

The first reason I believe this is Occam's razor. The simplest or least counter-intuitive explanation that is adequate is the best explanation. A theory of gravity that only requires dark energy is simpler and less convoluted than a theory that requires not only a hypothetical entity like dark energy, but \*also\* the inconceivable, hypothetical, metaphorical and invisible bending of space &amp; time that we have no direct evidence of.

&amp;#x200B;

The second is that neutrinos \*must\* contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe that without dark energy is contrary to the predictions of the general theory of relativity. Dark energy may also contribute to the observed amount of attraction between massive objects that we call gravity and may also contribute to the accelerating expansion of the known universe while having a much greater total effect such that these two factors alone are enough to explain gravity without the general theory. In fact, the neutrinos we have observed may simply be large neutrinos, and dark energy may simply be made of smaller neutrinos, or smaller particles that are otherwise similar to neutrinos, that we have not observed directly, and can so far only observe as gravitational attraction and the accelerating expansion of the known universe.

&amp;#x200B;

When a large enough number of neutrinos travel through a large enough object such as a planet, some of the total momentum of the neutrinos is lost. This means that the neutrino field traveling though a moon of a planet after traveling through that planet has less energy than the neutrino field passing through that moon from all other directions. This means that the neutrinos cause a net force on the moon in the direction of the earth. The same is true in the opposite direction, creating a less force on the planet by the unevenness in the neutrino field created by the moon, making neutrinos at least one component of the observed amount of attraction between a moon and its planet, even if it's a tiny or negligible portion of the observed amount of attraction. The total attraction between massive objects created by known neutrinos as a percentage of the total observed attraction can be and should be calculated by scientists, but it may be only a tiny and negligible component of total attraction between massive objects. If so, and observed neutrinos are actually large neutrinos, and dark energy is the sum of all smaller unobserved neutrinos and neutrino-like energy, and has a much greater total energy than individually observed large neutrinos, this alone would be enough to explain gravity \*and\* the accelerating expansion of the known universe, since the total energy of the dark energy field and large neutrino field may be unevenly distributed, such that there is indeed a centre of all galaxies in the current galactic explosion that includes all known galaxies, and the only place where the neutrino field is roughly even in all directions is the centre of this intergalactic explosion, and such that this uneven neutrino field has a net outward energy at all non-central points of the intergalactic explosion, and such that this unevenness increases with distance from the centre of the explosion. (It is important to note here that Hubble's claim that there is no centre to ""the universe"", which he appears to have equated with the intergalactic explosion that all known objects are part of, was based on the fact that it is impossible for us to determine a centre simply based on the relative movement of galaxies. If he was referring to the intergalactic explosion containing all known objeccts, his argument appears to have effectively been ""We can't determine a centre of our intergalactic explosion. Therefore, there is no centre"", which is not a valid argument. In fact, if the dark energy  theory of gravity is correct, the directly measurable component of the neutrino field energy may have a non-zero net direction at all points of the intergalactic explosion except for the centre and this may reflect the degree and magnitude of the net direction of dark energy, which may allow us to determine that there is a centre of the intergalactic explosion, and determine in which direction and how far it is from ourselves). Since even the smallest observed neutrinos have been calculated to be at least 6 million times smaller than an electron, the sum of all dark energy and large neutrinos could also account for the gravitational force between subatomic particles, even photons, assuming that dark energy can exert force on photons. This could imply either that at least some neutrinos affect photons, or else that dark energy is made of something other than neutrinos, but with the same capacity as neutrinos to pass through large massive objects and transfer a portion of their energy to those massive objects.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that this dark energy theory of gravity is already a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity given the reasons I gave at the start, but there is a way to provide more evidence in the form of providing more accurate predictions than the general theory of the exact difference in gravitational force between objects of difference size. The iteration of the dark energy theory of gravity described here predicts that an object that is twice as massive will \*not\* have exactly twice the apparent gravitational pull, and instead will have slightly less than twice the apparent gravitational pull, as some of the energy of the dark energy has already been lost by the time it reaches the middle of the massive object. So if we can accurately estimate the mass of an object without relying on gravity, and find that the observed attraction is even a tiny bit less than would would be predicted by the general theory of relativity for larger objects or a tiny bit more than predicted for smaller objects, then that would prove even further that either the dark energy or neutrino theory of gravity is a better explanation for gravity than the general theory of relativity. However, the difference may be so tiny that it is much smaller than the margin of error of our current methods and therefore not measurable.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a theory I actually came up with in school (2006 or earlier) and it's one of the reasons I went on to do physics at university. But the physics instruction at my university was so unbearably boring that I transferred to other subjects for my second year. I only shared my theory with a few other people in high school and lost interest after I transferred out of physics. However, I have described the theory here in case those stronger and more determined than me in finishing a physics degree are looking for something to investigate and may wish to choose this a a topic for investigation, and either prove or disprove this theory, or prove that it's less plausible or more plausible than the theory of general relativity as an explanation for both gravity and the accelerating expansion of the galactic explosion that all known galaxies are part of.

idyspy,Post PhD Job Opportunities [What do YOU actually do?],"Hello everyone

Four years ago during my undergraduate degree I asked what jobs are available to a physics graduate (see original post:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/4r3wqb/specific\_physics\_graduate\_career\_opportunities/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/4r3wqb/specific_physics_graduate_career_opportunities/)). 

The information provided about what many of you do for a living following from your undergraduate studies was very interesting, and more importantly, very useful in highlighting jobs and roles that I may have otherwise never have known about or considered. Following my undergraduate degree I worked in a graduate role training as a patent attorney before returning to university to begin my PhD. 

I would now like to ask the same question that I asked four years ago, but this time focusing on the opportunities available to physicists who hold PhD's. 

I would like to know what jobs you hold (whether academic or in industry, finance etc.), how you found out about the role, what if any additional training did you do for the role, what you may expect in terms of  career/salary progression in your field, and finally your personal thoughts about the roles you hold. 

I hope that this post will help inform people who are currently doing or who have recently finished a PhD in physics understand what options are available to them in the world of work. 

I look forward to reading about what you all do for a living. 

TL,DR: PhD holders, tell us about what you now do for work?",0,2020-08-21 10:26:58,0,2,2,2,2

I'm reading a few papers that present the average pairwise relatedness (based on molecular data and pedigree data) and SD for males within animal groups. I'm interested in knowing whether these groups include unrelated males, but only very few studies present their pairwise relatedness data (either on the main text or on the supplementary info). For example, I'm seeing a study that says that they found some males to be highly related within groups, and then present the average pairwise relatedness= 0.30 +- 0.10 -&gt; given these two points of information, I'm very tempted to assume that some male dyads are not related at all, but with averages you never know...  


So I wanted to know if there's some sort of a guideline or rule of thumb as to what average R value gives us a pretty good idea that there are unrelated dyads within the group? Can anyone recommend a paper that might be helpful for me to read?

I'm  beginning the process of self studying chemistry to get ahead of my  classes next year so I can prepare for USNCO.

I do have some experience  with introductory chemistry from middle school.

I'm wondering if I should go the textbook, some sort of online course, or khan academy route, *or*  a combination of all three. Either way, I'm planning on taking notes  from the material and taking the quizzes if provided, and if any  memorization is required I will make flashcards with Anki. Does this  sound good?

I'm pretty motivated  and since schoolwork is light and summer is right around the corner I'm  willing to put in up to a few hours a day. I want to get to AP Chem  material as fast as possible but I also want to make sure I fully  comprehend everything,

I have a  relative who homeschooed highschool intro chem as well as AP chem who  has most of the lab materials left over and is willing to send me them. I  understand many of the labs can be crucial to understanding.

First of all, I like to introduce myself: my name is Danilo, I'm a Biology graduating student from Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil. I new in the Reddit, so sorry if I disagree in any way in this platform.

I see a lot of people in these days saying and asking about ""functions of a X estructure"", for example: what the function of vestigial organs? So here goes the answer: there is no function in any biological structure (BS). Not at all. Why?

We can define ""function"" thinking in the purpose of these ""things"". A chair have a purpose, a function. A TV, a cellphone, a pencil, etc, all these things have a function. So, why a BS doesn't have a porpouse? Because they evolve naturally, there is no mind behind this process. After all, a BS exists by sheer probability, luckily.

So, in conclusion, personally I prefer to use ""functionality"" or ""operation"", because this way, the weight of the proposition of the existence of a creator is left aside.

Captive breeding resulting in reintroduction into the natural environments has been a popular method of conversationalists to help preserve endangered species. However, [it has been noticed](https://www.uwosh.edu/facstaff/mcpheem/private-docs/cv-documents/McPhee%202003%20BC.pdf) that generations of captive breeding reduces the pressures of natural selection, allowing for a wider deviance from the instinctual behaviors that strictly existed in the previous wild-caught generations. Because of this, many reintroduced captive bred species are not very successful in their natural habitats.

These findings call for change in animal conservation. Although conversationalists have the good intent of growing and saving diminishing species, are current methods inadvertently making them weaker and less fit?

For example, if Person A’s body is in the process of defeating the virus, does Person B constantly coughing more of the virus into A’s face affect that A’s body’s viral load to any significant degree?

How can A fully be rid of the virus if more keeps getting coughed into his face? I see that reinfection for the coronavirus at least is either due to not having enough antibodies yet or due to the virus possibly being biphasic.

I thought that logically A would stay sick if B, whose condition isn’t improving, constantly coughs in his face, but my friend with a PhD in biology told me that A’s illness wouldn’t be affected by B because it would be an insignificant number of viruses and also because A’s body is already fighting the viruses.

To better understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 and develop effective countermeasures against it, antibody-based immunoassays will be essential. 

https://preview.redd.it/g8e9wzovkg151.png?width=349&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9bd8bc6cdff11f9f6e9fbdb0fc5353f25504890

As 2019-nCoV and SARS N proteins have 90% homologous similarities, it is allowed that antibodies and antigens to SARS N protein to be used for diagnostic testing for 2019-nCoV. Diagnostic testing for the novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV is undertaken with 2 main approaches: genome sequencing and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Sequencing was used primarily in the early days of the outbreak for initial identification of this novel virus and is largely a tool of viral discovery. 

l rRT-PCR: Almost all diagnostic testing for nCoV is done using rRT-PCR. PCR mixes and enzymes are extensively used in fast, sensitive molecular tests. RNA was extracted and tested by real-time RT-PCR with 2019-nCoV–specific primers and probes. If two targets (open reading frame 1a or 1b, nucleocapsid protein) tested positive by specific real-time RT-PCR, the case would be considered to be laboratory-confirmed. A cycle threshold value (Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive test, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting. If the repeated Ct-value was less than 40 and an obvious peak was observed, or if the repeated Ct-value was less than 37, the retest was deemed positive. The genome was identified in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid from the patient by one of three methods: Sanger sequencing, Illumina sequencing, or nanopore sequencing. Respiratory specimens were inoculated in cells for viral isolation in enhanced biosafety laboratory 3 facilities at the China CDC.

Gene synthesis:   
 As the virus has been identified, most sequencing is being undertaken to further research in order to characterize it and monitor for viral mutation. Advances in gene synthesis mean that subunit vaccines can be developed quickly from one or more antigen-presenting viral genes or peptide sequences, which circumvents the need for scientists to handle live and potentially dangerous pathogens, and eliminates the time needed to clone DNA fragments.",0,2020-05-28 02:32:05,0,0,0,0,0

g8wlwe,Hearing Impairment During Old Age,"Hearing Impairment During Old Age 

Age-related hearing impairment (ARHI) is the result of genetic predispositions combined with various environmental factors that affect the inner ear and accumulate during a lifetime. Several genes may be involved in old age hearing loss. Mitochondrial DNA common deletion levels in human cochlear tissue are related to the severity of hearing loss in individuals with age-related hearing loss. In addition, it appears that reactive oxygen species formation and cell death are key events in the development of the disease. The environmental factors contributing to age-related hearing loss cannot be specifically determined but may include smoking, exposure to loud noise, and the use of drugs which include antibiotics such as gentamicin, streptomycin, tobramycin, loop diuretics, and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). ARHI does not follow a single pattern and may potentially be accompanied by either one or more of the following: an age-dependent loss of sensory hair cells and/or auditory nerve fibers, and degeneration of the cochlear tissues.

I have been wondering lately, about how easily your typical moisturizer can trap and stick to hydrocarbons and stuff.



If they can trap water under them so that they nourish the skin with the help of humectants, what about other materials?


I ask this because I can easily come into contact with indoxacarb and lead on a daily basis, the latter being due to the likely usage of lead paint in my house, and the former due to many things in my house contacting roach gel. 



I have cuts on my hands due to soap overuse. I'm just worried the humectants can cause indoxacarb and lead to stick to them, bring them under the skin, into the cut, directly givining it a pathway into my bloodstream.

hdg319,"Tell me if it's impossible so I won't waste 400 dollars, please!","Hi, 

I posted this in r/chemistry and r/DIYBeauty, but I think this is where it belongs

So basically, I am trying to formulate a skincare treatment to restore beneficial bacteria to my skin microbiome, in particular, I want to encourage s. epidermidis to ferment glycerol into acids that can kill off P. acnes. Yes, I have pretty persistent acne. I'm interested in this self-sustaining/homeostatic concept of bacteria on our skin THAT IS IN BALANCE with other bacteria, and can KEEP the balance. 

So I included loads of prebiotics, like inulin, oligosaccharides, sucrose, some plant sugars, and yeast proteins in the formulation. And of course, some bioferments. This is where I am worried (about the shelf-life, and \*\*preservative choice\*\*). 

My formulation is mainly comprised of bioferments of ingredients like rice, and it contains several strands of lactobacillus and other probiotics. Basically the formulation is chock-full of active fermented microbes, but I need to preserve the thing. Some preservations, like phenoxyethanol, is an irritant. 

I've decided to go with Silver citrate + citric acid, as well as an anti-microbial lactobacillus strand. I've included a third, gentler preservative — gluconolactone. My question is, will these preservatives kill the beneficial probiotic strands/microbes in my product? They are broad-spectrum after all. 

Please keep reading this next bit!

My formulation is currently this:

Deionised water, MC-Glucan (10%), Dimethyl Isosorbide (8%), Lactococcus Ferment Lysate (8%), Makgealli Extract (7%), Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract (7%), Hydrolized Yeast Protein (7%), Amber Extract (7%), Ophiopogon Japonicus root extract (7%), Inulin (6%), Leucidal Liquid (4%), \[water, milk proteins, bilfida ferment lysate\] (4%), \[alpha-glucan oligosaccharides, P.S. root juice, maltodextrin, lactobacillus\] (4%), Gluconolactone (3%), Bio Chelate \[water, saccharomyces zinc, saccharomyces copper, saccharomyces magnesium, saccharomyces Magnesium, saccharomyces Iron, saccharomyces Silicon\] (2%), Hydrolyzed hemp protein (2%), Silverion \[silver citrate, citric acid\] (0.15%)

Any glaring mistakes? Luckily this is a water-based, oil-free project, so I didn't have to add emulsifiers. Any stabilizers necessary? I estimate the final pH (after adjusting, of course) to be 5.8.

I'm worried about the amount of microorganisms in this, and the preservatives used. Will they kill all the beneficial microbes? Anyone know of a preservative/preservative system that is broad-spectrum, but is gentle and does not attack certain strains of commensialistic/beneficial bacteria?

I realize that was a kind of snoozy read, but if you have any suggestions/knowledge about cosmetic chemistry and bacteria, PLEASE reply!

A. an Environment where one species of insects is fed and taken care of over time, but air inside is a bit more saturated with oxygen, or at least find a mixture of air similar to an Earlier Permian period's Atmosphere which IDK if thats even possible. And then Record the results, finding if they get larger over generations. (this will have to be a quickly reproducing species that can still be at least monitored if not have a few generations to measure)  


B. An Environment with a totally self-sustaining ecosystem that can be monitored, again same variables with the Atmosphere. It would have predator and prey insects along with scavengers and other fauna. Obviously flora will be present in both i just didnt list it.  


List of Constant Variables:  
Insect species being observed (as well as food/prey insects)  
Atmospheric Composition

&amp;#x200B;

My question is : Given that burning matter for energy is pathetically inefficient and given that both fission and fusion yield only .08% and .7% conversion efficiency of mass into energy respectively 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be possible to somehow turn our sun into a blackhole? To increase energy output for the recreation of mass as well as help us delay the death of the solar system and universe? If the Sun is expected to last another 5 billion years then if it were a blackhole it could last much longer, it would allow us to use more of the energy to recreate matter which would eventually be resent back into the blackhole in a timely manner convenient for us and it would allow us to stay in this solar system for longer. It would either allow more humans to be born or it would prolong the existence of currently living humans 

&amp;#x200B;

All of this presupposes that the universe goes through heat death instead of a big crunch

gh0t7z,Notes on String Theory and Quantum Gravity (Feedback),"Hello everyone,

This is my first post on Reddit, so please be gentle. I noticed a recent post on string theory, and I was inspired to see so many engaged comments and general expression of interest in this area of mathematical physics. 

I'm not sure if it is appropriate, but I recently started a research blog in string theory / quantum gravity. As I have Asperger's, communication doesn't come easy when trying to write for others. I do not write in such a generally popular and accessible way as the post linked in the thread \[ [https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/ggd3t4/i\_wrote\_a\_blog\_post\_on\_finding\_gravity\_lurking\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/ggd3t4/i_wrote_a_blog_post_on_finding_gravity_lurking_in/) \], but I am trying to be accessible without losing any of the maths or important technical details.

 When it comes to string theory in general, I've started developing a series of posts that help guide the reader through Polchinski's textbooks (these are, in my opinion, the authoritative books when learning strings; but the texts can be dense). For example, the first posts in the series, as a preface to Vol. 1 of Polchinski I start with the non-relativistic string \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/notes-on-string-theory-the-nonrelativistic-string/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/notes-on-string-theory-the-nonrelativistic-string/) \] and the relativistic free-point particle \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/notes-on-string-theory-relativistic-free-point-particle/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/15/notes-on-string-theory-relativistic-free-point-particle/) \], which many will know from undergraduate physics. As a preface to Vol. 1 of Polchinski, I also build on the idea how string theory may first be developed as a generalisation of point particle theory \[ [https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/20/notes-on-string-theory-the-nambu-goto-action-for-the-relativistic-string/](https://tracingcurves.wordpress.com/2019/01/20/notes-on-string-theory-the-nambu-goto-action-for-the-relativistic-string/) \], which may help with some demystification and build some intuition. These posts can be read alongside Polchinski and perhaps more pedagogical textbooks (e.g., Zwiebach) to aid the inquisitive reader.

In string theory, the amazingly beautiful results that really bring the maths and physics to life are in the technical details! There are already a lot of popular science communications blogs (not my strength!), and so I am trying to still be maths heavy and yet more accessible and pedagogical (there is probably a limiting a point). As I am learning as I go when it comes to writing, I wanted to share these posts, firstly, and also share that constructive feedback on the posts would be helpful when writing future entries. For example, are complete derivations more useful without skipping many steps? That is, would people like to see the maths in full? Or would people mainly like to see the key equations mixed with the use of more intuitive language?

I’ve completed all the biology classes I need with easy A’s, same with my electives. Now I’m taking algebra and chemistry, and I’m doing very very bad. I never was good at these subjects in high school, and I’m struggling a lot with them. I have so much schoolwork on top of it, i find it so hard to get to talk to the professor and truly understand these topics. It seems like i only have time to complete assignments, but i always rush through because of all the other schoolwork i have. I just feel very discouraged because even when i do spend a lot of time studying these concepts, it takes me SO long to get it. I just feel like since I’m doing so poorly in math and chemistry, is bio even right for me? It’s mostly the math concepts of chemistry that trouble me. I can’t help but feel dumb since i don’t come from a “smart” family, especially none in STEM. My post is all over the place, i apologize. I’m on the border of passing and failing chemistry, and it’s my FIRST chem class. I guess i could use some advice or even some stories about failing some classes but coming back strong or something.

gxfdra,Can someone help me identify this food spoilage colony?,"Around Christmas, I made a simple syrup infused with clementines by boiling clementines in a concentrated simple syrup.  I then put the simple syrup in a jar and left it in the fridge, occasionally pulling it out to use a tablespoon or two to sweeten a cocktail.

In the last month or so, unbeknownst to me, something began to grow in the jar which was sitting at the back of my fridge:

[https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E](https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E)

Initially I thought it might be some kind of crystallization as the syrup is very thick (consistency of a runnier honey). However, upon inspection I realized that it looks more like a bacterial colony, made up of tiny even-sized circular nodules. There is no apparent smell, but I mixed a small amount with water in a beaker and the resulting liquid is somewhat opaque (similar to a yeast slurry) whereas the original syrup was crystal clear when mixed with water. 

Does anyone have ANY idea what this might be? Could it be a wild yeast of some kind? Without a microscope or other microbiology tools, is there any way I can find out more about what this might be?

For what it's worth, since I suspected that it might be yeast I have left the resulting solution in a beaker to see if it begins to ferment. Overnight, there appears to have been no obvious fermentation activity. I'll update if that changes.

Thank you in advance for any ideas. Please feel free to direct me to other subreddits if you feel they might be more able to answer.",2,2020-06-05 18:14:27,1,1,1,1,0

2. could time have never existed, and all the memory in my brain are just a state?

3. if everything paused in the entire universe, there's no way to measure how long it has paused, because the ground-state hyperfine transition of the CS-133 atom has also stopped, which defines our time.

g8jrcz,Seeking advice for a biology career,"If this is against community norms, mods, let me know and I'll take it down.

**TL;DR**: I'm a molecular biology undergrad who's scared and already on the back foot. Any advice for how to fix my prospects and actually have a future?

**Looong form**: I'm a junior studying for a B.S. in molecular biology, and I'm a wreck. My GPA isn't bad, (it's above 3 on a 4-point scale), but it isn't *good* either. More than that, my resume is as barren as a dried-up riverbed. For a number of reasons I've never had the courage to apply for any internships or lab positions, and here I am with grad school applications bearing down on me and no idea what to do. I don't mean to sound whiny or entitled, so I'm sorry off the bat if I come off that way.

I'm pretty sure I need to go to graduate school; it's necessary to begin any kind of serious career in biology. I don't know what program to apply for, and the idea of doing so terrifies me. If I had my choice, I'd probably study ecology and/or evolutionary biology, but since I chose molbio for undergrad (it seemed the ""sensible choice"" at the time compared to general biology), and since eco/evo seems difficult to find any sort of job security in, I'll probably have to apply for a microbiology M.S. or something like that, with the end goal of working in biotech or pharma. I wouldn't like it as much, but that can't be the deciding factor. What masters degrees would you recommend?

Regardless of what I go for, the process terrifies me b/c I don't have a GPA that screams ""exceptional academician,"" nor do I have any experience outside of instructional labs that could make up for it. On top of that, I know from the undergrad app process that I interview like a rotting tree stump. I don't have much going for me, so what - outside of giving up on it all right now - would somebody with experience here recommend that I do?

Of course there's always the option of graduating with the B.S. and trying to take a gap year or two before applying for grad school. Here I'd run into similar issues: Say I try to find an internship or job to build up my resume during this time. How could I? Where would it make sense for me to apply? I don't have anything to offer to begin with, so how could I get hired or accepted? And if I eventually apply to grad school, would the gap year or two look bad? I'm fairly certain I could swing the GRE studying on my own, but while we're here what advice would you give about that? Are the subject tests worth the hassle?

Thanks a *million* to anyone who reads all of this nonsense, and to anyone with any advice at all. I value it immensely - because I really need it. Cheers!",10,2020-04-26 13:39:18,0,0,0,0,0

hhhfhd,To waive or not to waive remaining classes.,"Hi folks, I was wondering if any of you had advice as to a situation I find myself in.

I received an email from the department chair yesterday, in which he offered to waive two classes that are otherwise required for the Environmental Chemistry degree I've been workings towards. One of them is a senior level Marine Science fieldwork class, which I was actually going to ask to be waived anyway as the subject material of that class is something I've already been doing to assist in the research of the Marine Science chair. The other class is a class on meteorology, which will be offered next spring. One I complete those two courses next spring I will be finished with my bachelors. 

Now here is the question: do I waive meteorology and graduate a semester early, and use online resources to teach myself meteorology? Or do I stay and take the course, and find other interesting classes to take as otherwise I'd be commuting to school for that class only? Otherwise, would it be feasible to ask if there's a possibility to do it as an independent study course where I can still graduate a semester early but at least get some credit for learning the material?

I'm not entirely sure what the course entails and it's only offered once a year as there aren't many people who need it (there are maybe 6 EnviroChem majors tops at my school including myself), but I don't want to risk shortchanging myself when it comes to job applications as Marine chemistry and atmospheric chemistry are my main interests.",4,2020-06-28 11:32:43,0,1,1,1,1

hyk2bq,Thoughts on human neck growth?,"Hi, I am a 27 year old male. From being a toddler through middle adolescence, I had a short neck. I eventually grew to become 6’ tall. I don’t have an extremely long neck, but from clavicle to chin is ~3 1/2”. 

Could neck length be in response to nutrition or lack of nutrition? My family initially had good income up until I was about 9 years old. Then my dad lost his job and his industry changed. I was fed, but regular meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner weren’t consistent. My dad still works, but he has made less money ever since. I have recently put on 30 lbs from working out this past year and learning about my body’s nutritional needs (I need to eat a lot of food to maintain or gain weight - as an ecotmorph) 

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",4,2020-07-26 21:39:54,0,0,0,0,0

flv1qg,Need help with positive &amp; negative pressure airflow for PCR laboratory,"Hi there! I am with a company who is lucky enough to be expanding our operations into a new building. Our PCR laboratory will feature 3 rooms: A reagent prep room, a sample preparation room (DNA extraction) and a post-PCR laboratory. Since we are designing the building, we get to decide what air flow we need throughout this unidirectional workflow. 

Now. It's clear to me that the reagent prep room, the ""cleanest room"", needs positive pressure to keep contaminants out. Also clear - the post-PCR room needs negative pressure to keep amplicon contaminants IN. What is not clear to me is how to treat the extraction room. 

In both of my previous labs, we didn't have the luxury of having a separate room for DNA extraction. DNA extraction was considered a ""pre-PCR"" activity and done under positive pressure in the pre-PCR area. HOWEVER, upon further research, I've found multiple sources which say the DNA extraction room, being ""dirtier"" than the reagent prep room, should have negative pressure like the post-PCR room for the reason of keeping DNA inside the room and nowhere else. 

This resource, on page 13, shows that the nucleic acid prep room should have negative pressure, and then on page 16 shows an example floor plan with POSITIVE pressure in the extraction room! https://www.aphl.org/programs/newborn_screening/Documents/2015_Molecular-Workshop/Molecular-Laboratory-Design-QAQC-Considerations.pdf

I have found conflicting sources online about what to do about this. I would really appreciate any insight. For context, our rooms are separated by a shared hallway. My concern with putting negative pressure in the DNA extraction room is that we will pull in amplicon contamination. This is the room in which we will be opening our reaction tubes to add DNA template - I wouldn't want to introduce amplicon contamination at that point.

hze7ka,Idionella/home plastic composting,"I had the idea of getting some of the organisms currently thought to consume plastic and having a kind of home plastic compost bin. I have a few questions about it though which I've not been able to find answers for.

Firstly, it seems some organisms might not break down (I think the term is mineralise) the plastic but rather just sort of shred it into smaller plastics/microplastics. I think for my project I'd probably want to avoid these.

There's also many different kinds of plastics and some break down more readily than others. I'm not a chemist or biologist so I'd probably need some advising here (I am interested in science so any insight into what this process looks like on a chemical/biological level is always cool).

The organisms I've come across are Idionella Sakaiensis, which is sold here (not sure which country that's from or how legit it is):

https://catalog.bcrc.firdi.org.tw/BcrcContent?bid=81045

And Aspergillus Tubigensis which I've found on one website you can buy online but appears to be about £300. 

Has anyone any experience with growing these organisms/doing this kind of thing? What environments do they like best/how easy are they to cultivate?

Are there any other organisms that would do a better job than these two and/or which are more readily available?

Initially I thought I might have a community of various organisms as some might break down the plastic into a form that others can work with, but I don't know if they'd live well together. I heard once that some fungi and bacteria are really competitive and kind of chemically attack each other and this is why we can get some antibacterial drugs from fungi, because fungi use antibacterials already against their bacterial foes. Nature is great. Greature. 

Never done anything like this before so any input would be appreciated. Maybe it'd be like releasing the grey goo growing these things in our plastic world.

hn0e3a,how soon should TGF-b inhibitors be used to inhibit fibrosis after tearing a soft tissue?,"When I say TGF-b inhibitors I mean taking curcumin which inhibits it.  Ive read that TGF-b inhibitors are effective to inhibit the formation for internal fibrosis/scar tissue, im wondering how soon could they be used after tearing a soft tissue to minimize scar tissue formation in the torn soft tissue?

 Reason I ask is because perhaps TGF-b inhibitors would inhibit healing of the tissue if used too early in the healing process? 

 im reading here “Exogenous TGF-beta stimulates the formation of granulation tissue which increases the rate of wound closure in full thickness skin wounds. The chronic expression of TGF beta can stimulate the formation of scar tissue”, am I right in saying this means that you shouldn’t use TGF-β inhibitor  until a wound has closed on the skin/surface? https://www.researchgate.net/post/what_is_the_role_of_TGF-beta_in_wound_healing

ievr4n,I would like your thoughts on this,"Hi everyone,

Ever since quarantine began, I’ve been stock trading to make some extra cash on the side, and recently, I’ve gotten pretty heavy into it. Now you might be wondering what that has to do with this sub, so let me tell you just that. 

I invested in a biotech company called IBIO, which has been working along with other companies to aid the world in this Covid race. That being said, their manufacturing process is really interesting and I think it’ll be quite valuable for vaccine creation. Their stock was at $2.00 per share back a few months ago and then it jumped all the way to $7.5 in late July before tanking recently all the way below $2.00. The price first dropped to around $3.00 after the announcement of the Russian vaccine came about, but then it tanked further due to a bearish market that was caused by an insider selling by a shareholder named Dart. The rumors being passed around are that Dart did it for one of two reasons:

1. IBIO can’t receive government funding if they have more than a certain percentage (25% I think) of foreign ownership, and Dart is a foreign owner who had more ownership than that percentage.

2. Dart’s other businesses aren’t performing as well due to the Covid situation, and he potentially wanted to put his funds there to help them recover.

That being said, no other insider selling has occurred since then despite how much the price tanked. So that tells me that these insiders still believe in the upside of the stock and that the downtrend is based on panic selling pretty much.

I’m here because you all have some biological education background and I was wondering what you all think of the work IBIO is doing. I’ve done my own fair of research on the company, but I don’t know much from a biological perspective and would like to hear your opinions in that regard. Is what they’re doing revolutionary? Are there any potential drawbacks to their processes and style of making vaccines? Are the non-Covid vaccines they’re producing of high value, demand, and significance? How feasible are their goals?

If you can please help with this, I would really appreciate it because I thought I was lucky to buy the stock’s first dip post Russian vaccine news, but it tanked further on me, and now I’m kinda stuck bag holding, so I’m somewhat trying to decide if I should hold long term or sell off the shares I have (if there’s no potential in the company’s growth).

Hello, I imagine many students have moved their classes online as we have at my university. This has left my students as well as others’ feeling like they are not getting enough time with instructors to discuss the contents of their physics classes. I have come up with an idea about how to curb this a little. I am hosting a Twitch.tv stream located at Twitch.tv/physicsoh. I will be opening it up a certain times per week to make it available at no cost to students (or anyone for that matter) to come as ask questions or post suggestions (video or non) to others that our struggling.

I am a second-year graduate student studying particle physics and have been a TA of calc-based intro physics for 5 semesters including this one. I will happily take any question at an undergraduate level and hopefully be able to provide insight if not help you come to a solution using my “at home” teaching set up. 

I emphasize that this is a free service. At this time in our personal histories I believe it is important to step up and help each other out as we attempt to continue our education the only feasible way we currently can. With that said please know all questions and video submissions to the channel will be free, with instructions on the channel page. There is however a “Mature” warning simply because I am unsure or unfamiliar with my ability to screen content posted by others. When I become more fluent with this service I hope to remove the mature tag. 

The first session will be held today Saturday 3/21/2020 at 1pm Est and will end at approximately 4pm Est. The second session will be held on Monday 3/23/2020 at the same times. So, come one and all to discuss physics, have your questions answered, or just relax in our chilled study environment. Thanks, and best wishes,

It seems to me that the most logical sensor to use (accelerometers), are incredibly inaccurate due to small errors in orientation which cause immense errors over time. A research paper I read said that with only 1 degree of error in orientation the position was off by 6km after 10 minutes...

I come with a simple question. 

Items to work with  
\- 2 identical coffee cups  
\- 2 identical packets of honey, but one is crystallized solid while the other is still liquid  
\- a coffee machine to dispense hot water  
\- a room temperature environment where each item exists long enough to obtain equilibrium with the temperature

Provided that 1 packet is placed in each mug and each mug is filled up with x ounces of water, will the crystallized honey packet absorb more heat than the non crystallized honey packet since the first is in a more solid state?

I believe I found my answer online, but I wanted to pass it by you guys to get your input. I'm guessing it will take more energy to break down the crystallized bonds.

gaxs0g,Should I go for a degree in chemistry if I’m bad at calculus and inorganic?,"Hi everybody. At the beginning of this semester I decided to get an extra dose of chemistry by taking inorganic chem I as an elective along with Orgo II since I’m currently a bio major/chem minor on the premed track. I naïvely did this because I figured I could potentially go into the field of chemistry if medical school doesn’t work out just in case since I really enjoyed Orgo 2 lecture and lab more than any bio course I have taken.

Unfortunately my performance in inorganic and Calc 1 was awful than I expected due to poor work ethic and time management (Cs in both classes but A in Orgo2). And with all my classes going online only made things worse. Which is why I’ll be selecting P so that it doesn’t hurt my gpa. That being said if I ever go into the field of chemistry I’d rather be working with organic or biochemistry since those are the areas of chemistry that interest me the most. I only understood a little bit of assigning point groups, calculating lattice enthalpy, and molecular geometry, but everything else that involves mo diagrams and hcp, ccp, and all that weird cubic stuff made little to know sense to me.

I’m just worried that my bad performance is going to bite me in the back later on when I take physics, p-chem, and another 2 semesters of calculus.",4,2020-04-30 10:28:15,1,1,1,1,1

On shaking the solution yielded a not insignificant amount of white precipitate which sank to the bottom when left. I assume it a reaction between some of the additives in the gel, producing a salt of some kind? Maybe an ester at a push?

gcccgg,I'm super passionate about research but have no clue what to do! Help!,"So I'll start out by saying that I've been jumping through threads by hours and I've spent some good time reading through the biology one. I've come to recognize that this is probably a place where I can get insightful advice from people who know and so I actually went and finally created a reddit account so I can post. 

For years my dream has been to do stem cell research and this is what I want to do in the future! But I'm so confused about the steps to get there. I started college and went into biomedical engineering which at the time I thought was probably the only way I could get into research, but a few years in I've found out just how miserable I am in it because I don't like engineering and most of the BME classes in my university are mainly just focused on the designing of stuff and mechanics. Huge mistake on my part not figuring it out before. So I changed my major to Biology because I figured that if I need an MS and a PhD then I should do something that is more similar to what I want for my undergrad and then slowly start focusing on stem cells (if thats even possible). But now I'm just confused... I've been stressed out for a few months now about this all but I feel like I've reached my breaking point... so I'm also sorry about this post sounding a bit desperate.

To be honest I just really need advice... I love stem cells and I love research! I am constantly watching news about it and all my family sends me articles and stuff because they know just how passionate I am. I, in no way, want to give up this path, but I do need someone to maybe direct me a bit?

Sorry about how ranty this was but if someone here is doing research (doesn't necessarily have to be stem cells, just medical research in general), do you have any advice and important tips you could give me? Any help is really appreciated! I hope everyone's doing well right now with the state of the world. Thanks.",3,2020-05-02 14:32:16,0,0,0,0,0

i18fo8,Why is this different from dark matter? (Help!),"So as I understand it, the search dark matter is predicted by some of our best high level physical theories. As a result, many physicists believe it probably exists, and are willing to spend years, and lots of money, searching for it - despite us (so far) having no actual evidence for it's existence (beyond the theory).

On the other hand, the Drake Equation, coupled with the sheer number of planets in the universe, and the assumption that if we have one data point (earth) it's probably a non-special, average planet - implies that there really should be lots of intelligent life out there (even if it's one in a billion billion, there would still be a lot). Which is captured by the Fermi paradox. However, despite the theory saying that the simplest answer is that intelligent life is commonplace, the search for intelligent life isn't taken seriously by many physicists - to the point where saying any astronomical result could possibly be intelligent life is hugely looked down on, and can even end your career.

Why? Seems to me there are strong parallels with the search for dark matter, where the invisible thing predicted by theory is widely accepted. So why is looking for, or ascribing 'aliens' as a possible answer to a question in physics so taboo? 

(Caveat: I know there are lots of ways to massage the drake equation to make complex life be absurdly rare. That's not my point - I'm really asking why, given the *simple* answer is that intelligent life is commonplace in the galaxy (i.e. we don't have to introduce extra things like rare earth, great filters, etc. to explain why it's not), physics still treats the implication like it's virtually impossible.)",9,2020-07-31 09:27:30,2,2,2,2,2

I know it's fantasy, but it gets me thinking, and assuming all this I want to get the physics right. So I've got a few questions for you, if you don't mind. 

* assuming there is a breathable atmosphere, what would the sky look like ? 
* would it be possible to see far, far away, or would a thick atmosphere prevent us from seing unlit objects or surfaces ?
* if there actually *was* a horizon line, how different would it be than ours ? would objects on the sides of our vision angle appear closer or farther than they do on the surface ?

I hope this makes sense. Thank you for your answers.",0,2020-04-10 13:44:50,2,2,2,2,2

fkrulx,A formula to estimate the current number of infected people.,"I am an astrophysicist at Cambridge University who was recently sent to my home country due to the Corona crisis. In my boredom I have derived a simple approximation to help you estimate the number of people that are currently infected with the Corona virus. The derivation is based on the number of people that die, as that is the only parameter that is accurately tracked with the current testing shortage.

Assumptions/parameters:
The virus doubles every *td* days. A fraction *x* of infected people dies after *tx* days, while (1-*x*) heal after *th* days. Then we can derive for the number of newly infected people that:

Newly infected people (*I*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*I* = *D/x* \* 2^(*tx/td*)

Total number of infected people (*N*) per day based on the number of deaths that day (*D*):
*N* = D td / (ln(2)*x*) \* 2^(*tx/td*) \* (1-2^(*th/td*))

If we plug in the numbers that are currently floating around (*x~0.01, td~6, th=tx~20*), the formulae approximate to:
*I~1000 D*, 
*N~10000 D*
But feel free to adopt parameters that you feel are more accurate to the specific region you are looking at. As an example, this approximates about 150.000 new Iranian cases today (from 150 deaths), with an infected population at 1.5 million.

𝑏𝑦 𝐽𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑦 𝐻𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑠

Please just try to clear your mind of all preconceptions of what you were taught or currently think time to be. EVERYTHING you need to know about what time actually is and what it is NOT will be explained clearly in my following comments. Please read ALL of it with an open mind and a willingness to understand time in a different way than you did before.

You must first be sure that you having a proper understanding of what time actually is and what it is not before you begin trying to interpret theories such as the theories of special and general relativity.  Because when you apply a misunderstanding of time to your interpretation of such theories, you are bound to make some conclusions that are not true.

Einstein made a great achievement with the concept of an elastic aether he called ""space-time"" that explains the cause of gravity. But, I believe he also set back science over a hundred years in properly understanding time.  I have great confidence that a day will come when scientists will look back and laugh at how ridiculous the theory of ""relative time"" and ""time dilation"" was, and how stupid people were to actually believe it was true.

Time has no rate, it has no speed, it has no ""flow"", it has no direction, it is not a dimension, it is not a distance, it does not progress, and it is not a requirement for motion and change to occur. Clock rate retardation is not the same thing as ""time dilation"". Relative motion is not the same thing as ""relative time"", and relative motion is the only thing that clocks can ""measure"" (compare). Time equals time, and space equals space, and those two things do not equal each other. You never travel ""through time"", you only move across points in space.

Saying that ""time slows down"", is a phrase that makes no sense and has no meaning. It is tantamount to saying that temperature could slow down, that a gallon could slow down, or that a mile could slow down. It doesn't make sense, because you are describing a change in a property for those concepts that those concepts do not possess nor represent in the first place. You can't change the temperature of a gallon, because a gallon has no temperature to change, and you can't change the speed of time because time has no speed to change.

Time is not the same thing as chronology either. Chronology is the true order and progression of motion and change that is objective and has nothing do with whether you observed it or not.

It never IS a time, it only ever is a moment in chronology, or a moment in the progression of change and motion. Past, present, and future are adjectives that describe the placement of moments in chronology, not their placement in time.

Time is NOT the ""arrow for entropy"" or vice versa. It is CHRONOLOGY that is that arrow. This is because chronology and entropy are things that progress and have a direction. Time does not progress and has no direction. It doesn't make sense to think that a period of unobserved progression can be something that is progressing itself. A period in the PAST cannot change.

Entropy is the irreversible elimination of possibilities for a system, that is brought about by the progression of change and motion, not by some invisible boogeyman named time. It is not time that ages you or that causes systems to deteriorate. It is spatial motion of objects, interaction with other objects, and internal changes caused by spatial motion and interaction with other objects that causes aging and deterioration.

I am not saying that clocks do not serve a practical purpose. They do. They help us remain in sync with the rotation of the Earth, with the day, the night, and with each other. But their purpose is not to measure or represent time. I will further elaborate on the differences between time and what clocks ""measure"" in another article I will post named, ""Clocks Do Not 'Measure' What You Think They Do.""

Time is something different.

The reason for past confusion regarding time is there has been no clarity between terms, and people have tried to use the word time to describe too many different things. You can't make time be synonymous with clock rate, synonymous with motion and change, and also synonymous with chronology, because those things contradict each other. Time is not a synonym for any of those things. Time should have no synonyms. There should be no other word that describes what time describes.

So here is a list of clear terms...

Clock rate = The comparison of the motion of the hands on a clock to the motion of another object during the same period of progression.

Chronology = The true order or progression of the change and motion of objects, that is completely objective and doesn't matter if it was observed or not.

Time = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, and you missed out on observing.

History = A period of the progression of change and motion that already happened, that you were present to observe and document.

Chronology is the OBJECTIVE progression of events that does not depend on your observation as part of its definition. But time and history DO depend on your observation or lack thereof in order to define which one is which.

Time must be extrapolated, but history must not, because history was observed and time was not. So you could think of time as being the opposite of history.

You must understand that there can be two different kinds of time. There is individual time from the perspective of one observer, and there is collaborative time where multiple observers work together to compare notes or combine observations. This means there would be a personal history and a collaborative history.

So from the perspective of an observer in the US, the events that happened in China that he missed out on observing himself would be his individual time. But when the guy from China comes and tells him what happened in China while he was observing the US, and the guy from the US returns the favor, they have now eliminated some time by collaborating and making a collective history.

So, collaborative time will always be less than individual time, and collaborative documentation of chronology (collaborative history) will always be more documentation than individual documentation (individual history). You can only document what is KNOWN because it was OBSERVED. Extrapolation is not documentation.

If you could observe the progression everywhere and for everything in the universe simultaneously, then time would literally not exist FOR YOU. Because nothing would be missed by your observation, and everything would be documented history instead.

Time does not determine where and when change or motion can occur, or how fast or slow that change and motion can occur. It doesn't ""take time"" for an object to move from point A to point Z. That motion only requires a physical cause and progression of that motion through all points between A and Z.

Time is just a gap in your observation of the progression of change and motion that occurred in between two known (observed) moments in that progression.

Once mankind understands this, we will all then realize that our common goal should be to work together combining our observations to eliminate the enemy of knowledge, that is time.",4,2020-04-06 22:00:03,2,2,2,2,2

By that I mean, could black holes literally be ""cracks"" (or holes) in space time? 
I thought, it could be that what we see (or don't see) in a black hole is actually the nothingness which is filled by our universe and we see (or again, don't see) what was there before the universe.
If you think about it, black holes behave like actual holes in a lot of ways.
-They dissapear over time (the hole filling up again with space and mass?)
-Nothing can escape them (there can be no time in nothingness.)
And the radius in which they attract things is actually not that big for an object that huge (I am not to sure about that, but I think it has a pretty small radius compared to some other objects). So what if the objects that fall victim to black holes do not gravitate towards them, but rather ""fall through"" them?

Black holes are created by objects having huge amounts of mass. What if at a certain point these objects actually are so huge, that even space can't hold them and they just sort of crack it open? 

I am sorry if it is a stupid idea because of my lack of knowledge about the topic, but I just had to get some clarity if this idea is something actually possible",4,2020-07-09 05:44:17,2,2,2,2,2

Initially we have a population with say, 1 PP and 11 pp and we let the people pair up and have four children per pair. The next generation has 4 Pp and 20 pp. The proportion of those with the trait has increased.

From here, if Pp only breed with pp, the ratio stays constant but if a Pp breeds with a Pp, the ratio increases and a PP is produced which then reproduces and increases the ratio again.

Seemingly, the proportion of those with the trait can only increase (assuming no loss of reproductive capacity) so why does it not take over the population? What am I missing here?",10,2020-07-28 06:29:28,0,0,0,0,0

gnsh6q,Cobalt sulfide and concentrated acids?,"Hello, everybody!

I'm reaching out to you for help because I couldn't find any straightforward information on the internet regarding this topic.

My question is: Does CoS (cobalt sulfide) react with concentrated HCl and does it react with concentrated HNO3?

I know that most sulfides when treated with strong acids emit a gas - H2S but I'm not sure what happens in the case of Cobalt Sulfide because it is the first time I'm working with it. Does it give H2S with HCl? Does it give H2S with HNO3? Does it react at all with them?

CoS + 2 HCl (concnetrated)      --&gt; CoCl2 + H2S         ???

CoS + 2 HNO3 (concentrated) --&gt; Co(NO3)2 + H2S   ???

I know that in order to understand whether the reaction would take place or not when it's regarding two compounds with low solubility in water, I should first look at their Ksp and if the first compound is more soluble than the second - the reaction would take place. If the first compound is LESS soluble than the second (which is supposed to form during the reaction), then the reaction would not take place.

But in this case the compounds that are likely to form are respectively CoCl2 (with HCl) and Co(NO3)2 (with HNO3) which are known to be both quite soluble in water so I don't know what to do. Does that theory which I mentioned apply only when both compounds (the reactant and the product) are with low solubility in water?

In addition, I found a reaction on the internet that goes this way:

 3 CoS + 8 HNO3 = 2 NO + 4 H2O + 3 S + 3 Co(NO3)2

Is this possible and correct in any way? And if this is the correct reaction, why is it so and why does it not lead to emition of H2S like a proposed earlier?

I would be really, really thankful if some of you have the right answers to these questions because they have been torturing me for a few days already and I can't seem to find any realiable information.

I'm looking forward to seeing some of your opinions!

Thank you once again in advance!",2,2020-05-21 02:42:05,1,1,1,1,1

Also this idea makes no sense when looking the ray diagram of a converging planoconvex lens.

I already attended to all orgchem and organic analysis classes of my graduation, and I worked two years on a Organic Synthesis lab, but I still feel really insecure on this specific topic  


Can you guys recommend me any study plans? I got some books here (Pavia, Carey, Brucey...) But I also lack discipline to it.   


Thank you all in advance!",0,2020-03-27 13:40:25,1,1,1,1,1

gzzi87,Tips on Sonication of viscous oil/resin &amp; water,"I have a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator (FB 505) and I'm trying to suspend a viscous plant material oil/resin into water. The hope is to be able to get a good amount of this oil/resin into small quantities of water (eg: 1g oil in 2oz water). I have done a bunch of trials with the sonicator amplitude all the way up to 95% power, but each time, the resin continues to separate.  I have tried adding the resin to a carrier MCT oil (1/2oz) in 150 degree bath (which suspends much of it) then sonicating this mix with the 2oz water, but the combo then separates down the center. I've also tried adding two emulisifying agents (Xantham Gum &amp; Acacia Fiber) to this mix to suspend the oil mix (plant &amp; MCT). Same separation.

I haven't played much with the sonicator at low amplitudes, because my logic says that higher would mix stronger, but I'm open to reflections/ideas here.

Any advice on temperature of water, volume of water to resin etc?  Anything you know about Sonication of oils would be helpful actually! Any advice on how to use this device correctly would be greatly appreciated!

I had easy success mixing cannabis resin and water, but this particular CO2 extract plant matter is even stickier and tricky.

Thank you!

today I published my article *Visitors from afar* for my *Space Science with Python* tutorial series. This time, we will start working on comets! The next consecutive tutorials will build on each other. Each scientific or data scientific analysis requires one first step: data preparation. We obtain comet data from the Minor Planet Center and create a simple SQLite database. This database is the fundament for the next tutorials where we will make a scientific deep dive.

[Medium friends link](https://medium.com/@thomas.albin/comets-visitors-from-afar-4d432cf0f3b?source=friends_link&amp;sk=15313bd24e81936f6139bd1d81fff46d)

Besides the Python part I am thinking to write something like *Space Science in a Nutshell* articles where I would like to cover a several Solar System topics as a public outreach work. There are a lot of great articles and series on astronomy (galaxies, black holes, dark matter, ... the cool stuff), but I did not find anything that is related to our very cosmic neighbourhood. What do you thing? Please let me know. It would be more for the general public, so the experts would be bored. But in the last couple of weeks I realised that I really enjoy writing tutorials. During my research career I did a lot of public outreach presentations, guides and so on and would like to continue it at least virtually.

Same thing applies also for great astronomy software and tools like NASA HORIZONS, heavens above, and others. I think a lot of people would like to have a collection or compilation of nice astronomy software.

I hope I am not overshooting things and really hope for your feedback.

Also a second part to the question (but basically same question), for the Lepidosauromorpha and Archosauromorpha, is there a reason why they are set in that particular order? The only conclusion I come to is that their tree has less evolutionary ancestors..?

ftb4rt,"Colloidal Gold, ""Monoatomic Gold,"" and Checking Particle Size","So while I know colloidal gold and silver is legitimate, I've seen people selling ""monoatomic gold"" which I assume is actually some kind of gold ion suspended in water made from a salt extraction *(may be just a colloid with salt still left in the water? thoughts?)*

With ""monoatomic gold"" solutions being sold in stores, how can we check to see what the substance really is? How can we measure the particle size as well? Would mass spectroscopy coupled with something else be appropriate? What could that 'something else' be? 

If I were to make a colloidal gold solution at home, for example, I know that if the color looks red that means the size of the particles are 100nm or less. How can I know the exact size of the particles in this case? Is there a formula I should be looking at to estimate it, or is there a tech we can use to actually assess this? 


As an aside, the closest information i've come across to a legitimately 'monoatomic gold' in the sense that many of these companies are trying to sell it as is this: 

3 atoms of gold clustered particles derived from gold salts: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/338/6113/1452

I also came across an article about a way to dissolve gold using cyanogen bromide. Do you think dissolved gold is closer to what the spiritualists were trying to aim for with the 'monoatomic gold' concept? https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/new-compounds-make-dissolving-gold-simpler-and-safer/3010488.article",3,2020-04-01 18:25:17,1,1,1,1,1
hbdkgd,Human body muscles force and the body mass.,"According to classical mechanics for a force to lift a mass it should be slightly greater than its weight, this example is lifting a body tied with a rope in its center of gravity.

A person can use his muscle's force to lift his massive body in which his muscles's force is less than his weight.

An average  person to lift a rock of 60 kg with his arms is extremely harder than to lift himself ""60 kg "" up with his arms holding a bar.This means the muscles force used to raise his body is far less than the force used to lift a mass with the same value. 

I can jump high raising my massive 60 kg body using only my thigh's muscles but if we put a rock of 60 kg on my thighs  the thighs not only impossible to lift the 60 kg rock but there is a possibility to break my legs.

A person can walk upside down on his arms lifting his massive body which implies that he uses force far less than his weight and far less than the force needed to lift a mass with the same value"" 60 kg""

I can raise up my massive 60 kg body mass when trying to pick a fruit from a tree with only my feet and calf muscles's .In fact the lifting will be easy that I will not use my calf's and feet muscles maximum force.

The idea is when it is about a human body the muscles need a remarkably small force to lift the human which is less than the body weight  , but when it is a bout another mass the muscles need greater force which is bigger than the mass weight.",0,2020-06-18 07:21:46,2,2,0,2,2

fmutbn,Can you disinfect catheters that was before washed by rubbing alcohol first then water?,"I learned recently that you shouldn't mix Rubbing alcohol and bleach because it can cause Chloroform which is highly toxic. I don't have a liquid soap so I wash my catheters (for my neurogenic bladder) with Rubbing alcohol then I wash it after with water for 1 minute approx. Then put in a clean jar to use for later. When I ran out of clean catheters, I then soak all the used catheters in a bleach for 20 mins. Then I wash them thouroughly with water. Do you guys think that prior to soaking the catheter with bleach, there's still rubbing alcohol in it despite that I carefully washed it with water? Especially the inside of the catheter?

Note: I use old catheter for storage because I rely permanently on catheters and with COVID 19 recently,  it's much difficult for me to buy new 3 month supply of new catheter boxes.",1,2020-03-22 00:36:03,1,1,1,1,1

gi0lk2,Explaining the Zeeman Effect,"I am needing help understanding the Zeeman effect.

In principle I understand that adding an external magnetic field splits the energy levels and therefore splits the emission lines.

But is this a continuous process? Or would the magnetic field cause the electrons to line up, and the line splitting would cease, so you'd only see the splitting for a moment?

Why does a photon have the energy of the transition + the jump from the magnetic alignment?

Wouldn't the photon emitted just have the energy of the electron aligning with the field?

Does the process happen like:  Magnetic field on, electron aligns and drops in energy level, emitting a slightly higher energy photon?  And sometimes the electron aligns first, before transitioning, giving the energy of photon that would normally be given in absence of magnetic field?

Thank you!  Just trying to understand practically how the experiment was conducted and what physically is occurring.",1,2020-05-11 19:53:26,2,2,2,2,2
fiviho,Golfing &amp; UV &amp; coronavirus survival on golf greens,"I am trying to estimate how long a virus can survive on a surface that’s exposed directly to sunlight. My calculation goes as this: (1) according to an experiment I found (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17474029/), the 90% reduction of the RNA virus such as the coronavirus can be achieved with 1-8mJ/cm2 UV dose. (2) earth’s sunlight at ground level is about 32W/m2, this is 3.2mW/cm2. Therefore, am I right to say that in less than 2 seconds, 90% of corona virus on some surface can be killed with direct exposure to sunlight?

I am wondering about this as I am trying to estimate how much exposure I have going out on a golf course where I need to roll the golf ball on the green and having to pick it up multiple time during a round. According to the above calculation, it seems I am pretty safe. Let’s say someone who’s infected touched his golf ball and the ball left a few viruses on the green. I have to assume by the time my ball rolls thru that spot, it must’ve already been exposed for more than a few seconds.  Any thoughts about this estimation?",1,2020-03-14 23:00:29,0,0,0,0,2

So I see my hamster, and how fast she runs, so i got to thinking that what if a hamster was the size of a cheetah, which would run faster?

I did my math as follows: 

Cheetah can go 58mph, and I chose 58.8 inches for the size to use.

A Syrian hamster can go 6mph, and I chose 7.1 inches for the size to use.

I used speed divided by size to get .986 mph/inches for cheetah and .845 mph/inches for hamster.

gp6sh3,What units is heritability in? (It seems to be constrained between 0 and 1 - is it a percentage?),"Here's a passage from a book called Superintelligence, written by Nick Bostrom: 

&gt; Broad-sense heritability of adult IQ is usually estimated in the range of 0.5–0.8 within middle-class strata of developed nations (Bouchard 2004, 148).Narrow-sense heritability, which measures the portion of variance that isattributable to additive genetic factors, is lower (in the range 0.3–0.5) butstill  substantial  (Devlin  et  al.  1997;  Davies  et  al.  2011;  Visscher  et  al.2008).  These  estimates  could  change  for  different  populations  andenvironments,  as  heritabilities  vary  depending  on  the  population  andenvironment  being  studied.  For  example,  lower  heritabilities  have  beenfound among children and those from deprived environments (Benyaminet al. 2013; Turkheimer et al. 2003). Nisbett et al. (2012) review numerousenvironmental influences on variation in cognitive ability.

f7zojd,I believe one hundred percent that space is a superfluid medium,"Scientists currently don’t believe that space is a superfluid medium but their own observations and experiments show otherwise. Here are some experiments, observations and facts that show that maybe space is indeed a superfluid medium. 
Wave particle duality of all matter and energy -
All scientists believe that every form of matter and energy show wave particle duality, meaning that they behave as a wave as well as a particle. I believe this is a clear indication that maybe they show this duality because they are a part of the space medium. Since this medium is made up of fundamental particles, the matter which is standing wave of this medium and the energy which is traveling wave of this medium, show wave particle duality. Think of it like air and water. Air and water are both mediums that are made up of particles but waves are also being formed in them. So space is also just like these two mediums.
Conversion of matter into energy and vice versa- 
We know that matter can be converted into energy and we also know that energy can also be converted into matter. So is it wrong to assume that maybe it is possible because they are part of something which we have not discovered yet. That is the space medium. Matter which is a standing wave of this superfluid medium can be converted into energy because it is a travelling wave of this medium and vice versa. 
The double slit experiment -
The double slit experiment also proves the existence of a medium as even a single matter particle causes wave interference pattern when travelling through a double slit. I think that this happens because whenever anything moves in the superfluid space medium, waves are formed. Due to this, the waves made by the matter particle, moving through the double slit interferes with each other to make the pattern. Also when this particle is observed this pattern is destroyed because by observation we introduce more waves in the experiment that destroy the neat interference between the waves of a single particle. 
Dark matter and dark energy -
Scientists believe that alongside visible matter, there is also a lot of matter that we don’t see and observe. They call it Dark matter. Also alongside electromagnetic energy, there is a type of energy called dark energy which is responsible for the expansion of the universe, that we currently can’t observe or interact with. I believe these two unknowns are proof of the existence of the superfluid space medium. Dark matter is the medium itself, currently undetected. And dark energy are the waves being formed in this medium, some of which were formed in this medium during the big bang that are still pushing everything away from each other. Also since space medium is currently undetected, all the waves being formed in this medium that are also undetected currently, are considered as dark energy. 
Electromagnetic field and Higgs field
Scientist currently believe that there are two fields that permeates throughout the whole universe. These are called electromagnetic field and Higgs field. Higgs field gives mass to the particles and the electromagnetic field is responsible for energy. I believe that if you replace Higgs field with big space medium particle and electromagnetic field with small space medium particle and just accept that these two make the space medium that permeates throughout the entire universe then it solves all the problems and issues with our current model of Physics.
Solar sail-
   Just like wind sails that are using wind to move a boat, scientists believe that we can make a solar sail that can use sunlight to move a small spaceship. So just like waves of air and water that can push things, we have a very clear example of sunlight, which I believe is a wave of the space medium, pushing objects. Here is an article about it. Solar sails.
Nothing can’t create something 
The existence of the universe itself is the biggest proof that such a medium exists as nothing can’t create something. As scientists have clearly found that even empty space is full of energy. This energy is not coming from nothing but are just waves being formed and travelling in the superfluid space medium. 
        I think all these facts, observations and experiments prove that space is indeed a medium.

**Biology Definition:**  it is defined as the science that searches for characteristics that distinguish humans, animals, and plants from non-living things, such as growth, reproduction, nutrition etc. The biology is derived from two Greek words: 'bios' means life, and 'logos' meaning logic or study.

it is a science that specializes in studying the cellular structures of all life forms; simple ones such as bacteria that make up a cell one.

## Characteristics of living things

Living organisms are distinguished in all their forms with characteristics that distinguish them from inanimate objects. Among these characteristics are

* **Regulation**: Living organisms are distinguished by having a complex and independent structure, starting with the basic unit from which all life forms, that is, the [cell.](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-a-cell/)
* **The need for energy**: All living things need the energy they obtain in the form of food in order to carry out their metabolism and to survive.
* **Growth**: All living organisms grow and increase in size, and they can rebuild their cells when exposed to wounds.
* **Reproduction:** All living things are distinguished by their ability to produce new individuals.
* **Response**: All living things have the ability to respond to different stimuli.
* **Adaptation:** It means the ability of an organism to respond to the requirements of the environment in which it lives.

## Biology Branches

Biology is divided into many branches, including

1. Botany,
2. Biochemistry.
3. Cellular Biology.
4. Ecology.
5. Evolutionary Biology.
6. Genetics.
7. Molecular Biology.
8. Physiology,
9. Zoology

## The relationship of biology to other sciences:

Biology is a link between other natural sciences, and here are some examples that explain the relationship of biology to other sciences: \[1\] **Biophysics**: The science that uses theories of physics and mathematics to analyze some issues related to biology. \[2\] **Astrobiology**: The science that links biology and astronomy, and specializes in the study and development of extracellular life forms. \[3\] **Biogeography**: The science that explains the interpretation of the distribution of living things in the places in which they live.

\[4\] **Biomathematics**: Science that specializes in the study of topics and aspects of biology, using mathematical techniques and models. \[5\] **Bioengineering**: science that uses the principles of engineering to understand and analyze biological systems, and uses the principles of biology to analyze the principles of engineering science and its systems. \[6\] **Sociology**: the science that examines the role of biology information social construction of individuals, and their culture, and relations between them.

## Basics of biology

Among the basic concepts related to biology are the following:

* **Homeostasis:** Balance or internal stability or the ability of an organism to maintain and stable the internal temperature environment,
* **Cell Theory:** The theory of the cell developed by the scientist Rudolf Virchow in 1855 AD states that the bodies of living things consist of cells, and that living cells originate from previous living cells.
* **Gene Theory**: It states that genes are transmitted from parents to offspring through the transmission of hereditary material, knowing that genes are part of the chromosomes, and they are formed from the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid [(DNA).](https://24hoursofbiology.com/what-is-dna/)
* **Evolution**: The theory of evolution assumes that all living organisms originate from a common ancestor and that the differences that appear between living organisms are caused by genetic mutations, as the scientist Charles Darwin assumed that evolution also occurs through natural selection; that is, the living creatures that are able to adapt to its environment, which remains and inherits its characteristics to its children while living organisms that are unable to adapt to their environment die.

guu7lc,Correct Glovebox Protocol?,"Hi, I'm wondering what an appropriate protocol is for setting up a reaction on the Schlenk line, then shipping the reaction flask (containing the reaction mixture) into a glovebox for further work inside the box. Is this okay to do? Because I know glassware always have to be dried extensively before being shipped into the box, but if I ship in a reaction flask into the box, won't the outside of the glassware have some (very small) amount of moisture stuck on it?

And if this is okay to do, then do I need to evacuate the Schlenk flask (with the reaction mixture) to put it under vacuum before shipping it into a glovebox antechamber, or do I need to have it under nitrogen before putting it into an antechamber? I know these are stupid questions, it's just that I haven't used a glovebox before. Thanks.",12,2020-06-01 17:07:29,1,1,1,1,1

i610fp,Anybody ever feel like they made the wrong choice in their studies?,"I chose to be a biochemistry major at my school because I was extremely interested in taking the medicinal/organic chem courses which are offered. 

Since then I have taken the courses and I loved them, my biology courses? Not so much. I find the work tedious and I get told often by my bio professors that my analysis of biological issues is “too atomically and molecularly focused”. Whatever that means. It is really disheartening as I feel like an outcast in these classes, especially when I answer questions using my chemistry intuition and the class stares at me like I’m an alien.

I’ve done inorganic research and I love it, it’s not really hypothesis driven but more of just discovery in creating different coordination complexes and using X-Ray crystallography to determine the lattice structure. 

Physics never was a strong suit of mine considering i never took a course until my 3rd year in university, but my upcoming pchem classes seem like they are going to be much fun. I finally get to have the deeper understanding of the “gen chem” principles that were glosses over.

Through all this ranting I guess my question is, what can I do now that I realize I prefer chemistry to biology? I intended to apply to an MD/PhD program but as each day passes I think that’s more and more of a bad idea",1,2020-08-08 10:31:29,1,0,1,1,1

gcrqc4,Online science summer mentoring program (100% free),"(To the admins of the page: I apologize beforehand if this falls into the category of spam. However, it's a 100% free, online initiative which may interest some of the teachers or students here)

Dear chemists, 

I'm a teacher myself (I teach Maths &amp; Physics) but I'm also a part of a non-profit organization, the Inspiring Science Association. Our main goal is to enhance and encourage scientific vocations. We want to inspire young people to pursue a career in science by showing them how research is conducted and what it is like to be a scientist.

To do so, we have arranged the Online International Science Engagement Challenge (Online ISEC). Here, participants between the ages of 16 and 24 will have the opportunity to work on a scientific project designed to fit their interests and scientific background. These projects serve as an introduction to scientific research, while simultaneously being individualized and challenging. Students will be expected to work independently, delve into the available literature, and write a scientific report. They will work under the supervision and guidance of one of our knowledgeable mentors, who will support, guide, and encourage them throughout camp.

Online ISEC is a free, online initiative which will happen from June 29th to July 26th. Participants will choose two weeks within these dates to complete their projects. We are currently receiving applications! (Deadline is May 10)

This year I will be running some of the maths and physics projects so feel free to ask me more details. If you are interested, please check our website or contact me! Any help to spread the word around would be indeed appreciated :)

g8vooq,A brief summary of modern research.,"Out of hundreds and thousands of diseases affecting humankind, we pick up a certain disease which is mildly interesting yet well recognised by governments and grants. Now these diseases have a culprit which is often a pathogen and if you are lucky enough a mutated gene. The most important part of the research pipeline is doing fancy RNAseq or GWAS or Highthroughput protein interaction assays. This should give you a list of other proteins which interact with your protein. Now at this stage if you survey the literature you will see that all this was well studied in articles from 1970s-1990s. So you decide to identify a very specific problem with one particular article that you read one particular night when you were genuinely inspired to do science. For this you decide to employ a novel, cutting edge technique. Design a novel paradigm and design a perfect experiment with amazing control experiments which will cover all drawbacks.
But every silver lined cloud has a big dark centre. You need to order 10 highly specific, costly reagents. Which thanks to your mediocre funding are unavailable and even if available, reach you 6 months later than the date of order. The next 3 months you spend in optimization of reagents just to realize that the reagents you got were spoilt en route to you. So whatever results you got from the dialed down experiments are either faulty or incomplete. So you decide to use other technique and spend the next year through the same exact process.
Till either you are worn out or your funding.
Finally you decide to write a paper and submit it. The reviewer as cheeky and lazy as they are read one particular line and one particular result with prejudice and misconception just to give you either extremely relevant but time consuming, gut wrenching experiment or a simply a humiliating  response just for submitting a sub-par experiment. Yet, motivation thrives in you and you swallow your ego and go through the loops and get it published.
You achieve what? 2-3 citations from your own lab and some rare citations which help you to contribute to the next protein interaction culprit. All this for science? All this for knowledge? No all this is for the next disease, the next mildly interesting protein and its mildly interesting interaction, but that is well funded by the scientific community than what you have worked on for 5 years.",4,2020-04-27 02:05:27,0,0,0,0,0

gps50h,Sound of Jupiter (1970s) - Can anyone help me find out how this sound was made?,"**tl;dr** \- there are two types of recording available which are of 'Jupiter.' The scientist allegedly ran the radio waves into a synthesiser to create music. Is that what we are hearing? 

The official NASA recording, recorded by Fred Scarf, using Voyager 2's plasma wave subsystem, a 16 channel step frequency receiver. 

You can hear that it sounds... well, interesting, but kind of harsh and shitty. 

[https://youtu.be/5j5IObIReqk](https://youtu.be/5j5IObIReqk)

The version which most people know, however, sounds a lot more lush, and musical. That's this version, taken from a 90's CD of 'sounds of the planets,' which claims to have sourced the sounds from NASA: 

[https://youtu.be/UChzxK9gknM](https://youtu.be/UChzxK9gknM)

What is the relation between these two sound worlds? They are very different. 

The plasma scientist in charge of the measurements, Fred Scarf, had the 16 channel signal being run into a synthesiser back on Earth. He was converting the frequencies into some kind of music. He would perform this at certain press events to much amazement. 

The editor of *Science* wrote glowingly about one of these press conferences: 

*""Scarf creates “the sounds of space,” an eerie symphony of hisses, pops, and whistles.* \[...\] *His team played their data, which were divided into 16 frequency channels, through a 16-channel music synthesizer. The fragment of music that results is fitting accompaniment to Voyager's journey past Saturn. Slowly, dreamily, the midlevel brasses surge and ebb against a deep roll of basses and a high, floating treble. The music lasts for only a minute. But it haunts the mind.*

This description doesn't sound like either of the recordings. 

Perhaps this 'music' is what we hear on the first recording, those 'hisses, pops and whistles.' Perhaps the music made by Scarf has never been released. Perhaps it has been adapted into the more dreamy, ethereal 'Sound of Jupiter' that people listen to on YouTube.

gaj0aj,Where to get zeolite desiccate beads in EU?,"Hi.

I have recently seen a video from chemist youtuber NileRed, where he made an approximate 100% concentration of ethanol, by desiccating the 5% water content from the other 95% ethanol, using 3Å (ångströms) molecular sieve, such as Zeolite A beads.

Since most high concentrations of ethanol sold in my country are denatured to induce vomiting upon consumption, I have thought of desiccating the 60% water content of a 40% alc. vodka through multiple desiccations to make some potent potato moonshine.

Where exactly can I buy 3A desiccants that can be shipped to the EU? Tried both [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) and Ebay.co.uk , but both of these had their products either out of stock or unavailable for shipping to the EU (or Denmark in particular).",4,2020-04-29 17:13:15,1,1,1,1,1

I received a similar substance in the mail a couple of weeks ago.  I sent it for purity testing.  It is good.

Being that is was exposed to oxygen for a short time while being transferred into new bottles, will that compromise the efficacy of the substance?

I know the opposite charges will negate each other (electrons and protons) but that doesn't mean we can't have an electric field, right? It's like the case where we have a negative point charge and a positive point charge with distance r between them, where we do have an electric field but the total charge is zero. 

The reason I am asking is this : I read that if you have two opposite charged metal sheets sitting very close to each other, the electric field between them is almost homogenous. If an atom can induce an electric field around it, won't that affect the total electric field between the sheets?

fob8ix,Question on time and entanglement from a non phyisicit.,"Ey, I have a background in chemical engineering and have been working in DataAnalysis-SW-IT most of my adult life so my knowledge of physics can't be considered deep by any means but I wanted to, nevertheless, pose a question.

I think I understand that there is no an absolute time that ticks the same for all of us and that there is this thing called ""proper time"" or ""inner time"" (or something like that) which is what an observer would experience in his own frame of reference. This rate of passage of time depends on things like the velocity the observer is travelling with or gravitational fields affecting him.

I've read a bit on it in places like  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental\_testing\_of\_time\_dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_testing_of_time_dilation) where one can see how moving muons have longer lifetimes than resting ones...

Now comes the question from me...

Is the ""proper time"" of two quantum entangled particles necessarily the same? Can their clocks tick at different rates?

If it would be necessarily the same, would this imply that the state being entangled is something that we can declare to be independent of things like velocity, gravity, etc?

Perhaps a pair of particles would be entangled if and only if their internal clocks are exactly the same one. The moment something ""perturbs"" the common clock, entanglement vanishes...

Perhaps the most important question... does the question itself make at least a bit of sense?

Thanks for your sane replies and regards,

fuf5el,Need advice on working in industry then going to graduate school after undergrad," I'm going to be attending university next year as a physics major, with the intention of going to graduate school and getting a Ph.D. down the line. I love doing research, and I want to stay in academia. However, I will be taking 5 figure loans to pay for undergrad, and I think it is in my best interest to work in industry and pay those off before going to graduate school. I'll end up having a lot of debt (around 70k probably), and I don't think I'll be able to make payments on this while I'm in grad school due to having such a low salary as a Ph.D. candidate. So I want to work in industry first. I have a few concerns though - basically, I feel like I can only prepare myself for industry or grad school in undergrad, and I don't know how to set myself up to do both. Here's what I mean: to get into a good graduate program, I'll need as much research experience in undergrad as possible. But that means that I won't be able to get any industry experience, so when I'm applying to jobs after undergrad, I'll have no internships, etc. to put on my resume. Only research. Also, I feel like applying to grad school after working a few years in industry will really hurt my chances, as those will be a few years getting experience that does not relate to graduate school at all. Does anybody have experience with doing this kind of thing? Working in industry before grad school or paying off loans while in grad school? Any advice would help.

I studied plenty, I read the textbook plenty of times to understand the material and it's corresponding diagrams. I normally go to lecture and then read the textbook directly afterwards to fill in the gaps, and I usually understand most of the homework problems that are assigned. However, when the midterm comes up, the problems are so difficult that I have trouble finding a way to start. Now, I know I attend a fast-paced, difficult university (UCLA), but I can feel confident about an exam and then when I look at the problems I blank. This midterm, I was given 24 hours to do it with any resource except communication between classmates and other tutors, so it's not like it was testing anxiety. It's just that the problems are always so twisted in a way where you know the general concept it is trying to test, but not really how to go about it.

fkckqa,BRST symmetry: what does it mean?,"[BRST symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRST_quantization) is discussed in pretty much every introductory QFT class when quantizing gauge theories. It's a global symmetry of gauge theories that involves ghost fields. The conserved, nilpotent BRST charge allows us, via its cohomology, to pick out physically distinct states while modding out the redundant gauge degrees of freedom.

I have several questions about BRST symmetry. To summarize, my issue is that I understand BRST symmetry and cohomology on a superficial level, but I don't understand:

* **How could we have guessed that BRST symmetry exists without knowing about it in advance?**  
* **How do we know there aren't other global symmetries in gauge theories that we don't know about?**  
* **What is the deeper, geometrical meaning of BRST symmetry?**

The textbooks I've consulted so far (Peskin and Schroeder, Schwartz, and Srednicki) seems to pull this symmetry out of thin air. Of course, given the form of the BRST transformation, anyone can check it is a symmetry of the gauge-fixed Lagrangian. But if you just handed me the Lagrangian, how could I have guessed or known that such a symmetry exists, whose cohomology has the desired properties? Where does it come from? And what if there's another global symmetry lurking in there that we're just too dumb to see--is there a way to know that there are no other conserved charges?

I have also heard that BRST symmetry can be understood in a geometrical or topological sense, and it would be nice to learn this perspective.

Any resource recommendations on the topic are appreciated too. I started reading *Quantization of Gauge Theories* by Henneaux and Teitelboim, but it's not easy reading by any means--very abstract and technical. Something a little more concrete would be great.

I was on the fence about whether to post this in the weekly thread. My hope is that by making it a separate post, it'll spawn some nice open-ended discussion of BRST.",5,2020-03-17 15:35:45,2,2,2,2,2

I'm really interested in physics, but don't have the time for a rigorous course in it. Are there any books that aren't super technical that cover topics like classical mechanics, electricity, magnetism, quantum mechanics, space, etc. in an easily digestible way? I just want a book where these topics are introduced and the basics of them are explained, but I don't really want to be doing problem sets or refreshing my calculus. If there is nothing that covers these broad range of topics that's not a textbook, then what would be the best book on physics I could read as a novice? Thanks!",11,2020-06-23 23:09:24,2,2,2,2,2

Currently in my fourth year and final year of a Chemistry Single Major - and it has never dawned on me that I have never been thought about radical reactions. Is there any reason behind this (e.g. rarity or hard to control i.e. so DAMMMN reactive)?. 

Radical chemistry actually appears moderatley often (eg, gringard synthesis, radical polymerisation).

Basically i have two main questions:

(1) is radical chemistry taught elsewhere?

(2) is there any resources to explain a little radical chemistry to me?

gx94gx,Does the chemical Atrazine really make frogs gay?,"I've become interested in figuring out if there's any truth to the infamous Alex Jones line ""They're putting chemicals in the water that make the freaking frogs gay"". Surprisingly the topic is shrouded in controversy.

Tyrone Hayes published many studies claiming to show that low levels of the herbicide atrazine acts as a endocrine disruptor to the sexual development in African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis). In his lectures, Hayes presents images of frogs with both testes and ovaries. A 2010 Hayes study concluded that atrazine rendered 75% of male frogs sterile and turned one in 10 into females.

The controversy emerges from Hayes claiming that other studies contending his findings were influenced by funding from Syngenta, the company that developed Atrazine. His case is pretty compelling as it's told in these two articles:

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/02/10/a-valuable-reputation

https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2012/02/tyrone-hayes-atrazine-syngenta-feud-frog-endangered/

Use the model to analyze the sensitivity of the Silver Springs ecosystem to cultural eutrophication. Remember that algae is a photosynthetic producer on the first trophic level. View the graphs to see how the different trophic level populations change through the simulation.

Based on your findings with the model, answer the following questions:

What is the maximum number of producers the ecosystem can support before higher trophic levels begin to decline? The starting level was 3236. Why?

My question is this: where could I learn the basic of biology? Which resources would you recommend? It could be books, online classes (MOOC) or videos (youtube for ex). I am looking for comprehensive resources for beginners. Any topic really. (The language can be French, English or German.)

This is just for me, I am not planning to take a test or anything.

h9ywih,pH paper comes out white after bleach and vinegar solution, I was messing around with my universal pH paper and tested vinegar (pH 3.5)  and bleach (9.5). I tested both of these liquids using the paper and both times the color was clear and I was able to determine the pH. I wanted to mix the two in equal parts by volume to see if it would neutralize (out side duh). After I mixed the two liquids and the reaction settled I took a measurement again but the color squares on the paper turned white. Like pure white. The paper was able to measure concentrated bleach and vinegar on their own. Why when I mix the two did my litmus paper fail? Google says HOCI acid is formed. But I don't think that had anything to do with it. If it matters the solution was at room temperature when I took all readings. Thanks in advance.,7,2020-06-16 02:16:45,1,1,1,1,1

Longer and more frequent exposure play a role here. But just being exposed to the virus [doesn't mean you will get it](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/health/coronavirus-transmission-dose.html). Your body can fight off up to a certain amount. Even [past infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-020-0389-z) with a different corona virus [may help](https://www.wsj.com/articles/before-catching-coronavirus-some-peoples-immune-systems-are-already-primed-to-fight-it-11591959600). On the other hand, the antibodies produced in the body [may not last long](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/health/coronavirus-antibodies.html).

What I want to ask is, if you are exposed to a small amount of virus- not enough to get sick or show symptoms, can you develop temporary immunity from the virus? Can repetition of such exposure lead to a longer term immunity?

Disclaimer: I am definitely not an expert on the matter. The question is not anyway motivated by politics. Nor am I going to experiment with repeated exposures, or encourage anyone to do it (which would be foolish given how less we know about it). This is just from a point of curiosity. I would appreciate anyone sharing if any work has been done from this angle, or clarifying why this is not even a consideration. Thanks.

Edit: \[to clarify\]  
What I am interested in is a therapy instead of a vaccine. It can be live virus, neutralized virus, or even vaccines, that is administered in small doses repeatedly to achieve a longer term immunity.

Shouldn't it be 347 kJ/bond? Even in my textbook it gave me the following formula:

ΔH =  ΣnD(bonds broken) - ΣnD(bonds formed)

So just to point out the obvious, ΔH represents change in enthalpy and Σ means ""sum of"". In addition D represents the ""bond energy"" measured in kJ/mol.

The thing that confuses me is this...

In most equations I have seen thus far, the variable ""n"" normally refers to the number of moles (obviously measured in moles). But for the equation posted above, it is supposed to mean NUMBER OF BONDS... ALSO MEASURED IN MOLES.

How is your quantity of bonds supposed to be measured in moles? Yes, this equation works and gets you the right answer when used correctly... But how does it make sense?

During my Quantum Mechanics course last semester I was assigned a homework problem that some of you might remember too. It was problem 4.20 in Griffith's Quantum Mechanics ed.3, and here it is: https://imgur.com/nJSgllj.png

Essentially what the problem is asking the reader to do is to use the potential energy function for an electron in a hydrogen atom and to replace the electron mass with the earth mass. Through that, if we find earth's quantum number *n* and then drop it one energy level, the wavelength of the photon that would be emitted ends up having a wavelength of almost exactly 1 light year. Then, the question asks for your opinion of if it's a coincidence or not.

Let's say we took 1-200 Komodo dragons(male and female) and relocated them into parts of Africa where there are wild dogs, crocodiles, lions, hippos, hyenas etc etc.. What happens? 

  How would lions react to a new predator(Komodo dragon) in it's environment? Would it treat it as a threat or just like any other possible prey animal? What about hyena or crocodiles? Are Komodo dragons aggressive ?obviously they have never had to deal with other predators 

  Would the Komodo dragons die off or be killed off rather quickly or maybe they could survive and prosper? I'm curious where they would stand in the food chain ultimately especially with their  bacteria filled mouths",1,2020-06-27 15:14:04,0,0,0,0,0

They don't sink into the earth because a force diagram would show a counter force such as the earth's crust pushing away from the earth. If these forces were completely balanced with no resonance a person would be stationary in space I believe. What if for some people or objects who knows there was a skew of this force towards gravity. Their muscles would then be resisting the earth. What if then some people the force away from gravity were greater and they were held on the earth from floating away by the atmosphere for example. They might be walking on the earth and their muscles act completely differently. I believe this is the case.,18,2020-02-22 12:19:42,2,2,2,2,2

hllpv3,How to determine color of a crystal given the lowest wavelength photon that can be absorbed by it,"I had this question in a physics exam, and I've had to come back and revisit it to see if I ought to try to get it re-graded.

The question is: Given a crystal composed of an element with 4 electrons in its outer shell, which is then contaminated with nitrogen atoms (1 per 1 million), the energy gap is reduced to 2.2 eV. 

a) Find the longest wavelength photon that can be absorbed.  
This one I got right, its 564nm. 

b) Which color is the crystal, and why? 

Here is where I ran into issues. My thought process went as following: Per the Bohr model, the 2.2 eV is the energy difference between the two outmost energy levels. The atom will therefore have other, larger energy gaps, in which photons of higher energy can excite electrons. 

The electrons will be excited and eventually fall down again, transmitting a photon with energy (which also determines wavelength, color) corresponding to the energy gap between the two energy levels. Since the 564 nm wavelength corresponds to the lowest energy level difference, the other levels will transmit photons of lower wavelengths (higher energy). Therefore the atom will transmit colors &lt;= 564 nm, which is yellow, green, blue and purple. 

The multiple choice part gave us 4 options for the color: yellow, blue, white or dark red. (The lecturer admitted after the exam that none of these were really right, it was more of a orange, light red). Still though, I answered white due to it reflecting most of the colors in the spectrum.

My question then is, which part am I misunderstanding here? Is my thought process touching on some right principles, but overall wrong, or have I just misunderstood it all? 

I've been pondering on this for a couple of weeks now, and tried to google some stuff, but I haven't managed to find an explanation that makes sense to me yet. Would love any help!",1,2020-07-05 07:18:45,2,2,2,2,2

h147vu,Does a PhD lock you in a field of research ?,"Hey r/chemistry, 

Little question to PhDs here. I am currently in my first year PhD and I’m pretty anxious about my future. I am studying metal complexes that target cancer cells (lab in France btw). I hope to work in academia later, meaning I am aware I’ll have to do some postdocs. I chose my subject knowing it would be pretty wide and would teach me a lot of differents things (methods I mean) from organic synthesis to cell culture, with physico-chemical questions. But I’m afraid to be trapped in medicinal chemistry for life. 
So here’s my question : after my PhD, is it possible to do more fundamental researches and with different techniques than the ones I am currently using (postdocs) ? I developed an interest in biochemistry this year but every biochemistry postdoc offers I’ve seen so far ask for candidates able to do protein expression for example or others biomol techniques I only know in theory. I wish I could learn new things during postdocs, maybe more biochem/fundamental oriented but I only see offers but I feel recruiters want candidates who are really close to the subject’s team. Entering biochemistry lab with a medicinal chemistry curriculum seems impossible whereas I think it would be of interest to have experience in both, am I wrong ?

htsh4e,How do UV indicator cards work?,"I’ve seen cards or stickers that change color after being exposed to UV-C to indicate when a surface has been disinfected, for example. I’ve also heard of photochromic inks. Are these similar reactions? How do these things work? 

Do the reactions only work with UV or similar high energy light, or would it be possible to get a color change from the longer wavelengths in the visible spectrum? Could it be possible for an indicator sticker to be designed to change color after exposure to certain wavelengths only?

gpw74r,HEP Theory Reading Club (UF),"Hi All,

I am a graduate student in the University of Florida. Several of our students in HEP theory have established a reading club, and we are glad to invite you all.

The goal of our reading club is to read and review the content and the logic of theoretical physics textbooks. Currently, we are reading the *Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model* by Schwartz M.D. (As we progress, the material to cover will be more advanced.)

Our current members have already taken 4-5 semesters of QFT. The fact is, in class and homework the professors have no choice but to focus on the calculation more than the logic. However, when you read through any textbook, there are always some logic chains that are well or ill addressed, but cannot be explained in classes. This is the point we want to cover in the reading club.

We are meeting online each week on Tuesday. Please register for a Zoom Link using the following link if interested: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoDxKGy9Xy79gkLJPO6fkewMJnxfAEHeTkdV\_PxL38cIG2yg/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScoDxKGy9Xy79gkLJPO6fkewMJnxfAEHeTkdV_PxL38cIG2yg/viewform?usp=sf_link)",0,2020-05-24 14:55:56,2,2,2,2,2

I am finishing up my BS in Chemistry at OSU and would like some input on the next steps in my career pathway and what others have experienced in their career.

Currently, my undergraduate research is focused on the characterization of non-volatile PFAS in firefighter turnout gear. I am with a great PI who pushes me into more projects and is actively engaged in all of the grad students' work and day to day life (which I do enjoy). Also, I am the only undergraduate (actively) working with this group. Currently, I have an offer with this PI to pursue a Ph.D. either with the Department of Chemistry or Environmental and Molecular Toxicology. I am very interested in validating methods for large volume injection of organic micropollutants (specifically, PFAS) and working with collaborators to report levels of PFAS in various matrices (biota, textiles, groundwater, and soils). 

I have seen a lot of people take a year or two in industry before pursuing their Ph.D. and am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience (BS straight to MS/Ph.D.). For those who have done either, I would just like to hear your side of the story. What you did like, what you didn't like, anything you wished you knew before beginning your career, etc. Basically, any advice you can lend a young developing scientist I would love to hear.

It should demonstrate wave-particle duality by showing the interference pattern that is built as you fire a series of individual electrons through a double slit diffraction grating and onto an electron detector.

Components:

* Electron emitter emitting one electron per second (or roughly on that time scale)
* Double slit diffraction grating
* Electron detector, capable of detecting single electrons striking a 2d plane
* Vacuum enclosure (light-proof too?)

Nice-to-have: Ability to manipulate the experiment, eg replacing slits with detectors/blockers, tweaking parameters of the electron gun

The apparatus should connect to my computer (or have a built-in screen) where I can see the measurements of the electron detector graphed onto a 2d plane.

Here are some questions I have:

* Is this possible to build outside of a lab?
* Would it be insanely expensive?
* What are the hardest problems to solve?
* Could this be easily achieved by messing with an electron microscope?

Does anyone here know what would be a good  way to get rid of this deposit/build up?
We have tried water, but it seems to be doing little.
Does anyone here know if maybe vinegar, diesel or baking soda might work?

Or any other options

gkehyj,Process Chemist Job Experiences,"Hi everyone, I'll be graduating in a few days with a bachelor's in chemistry. Due to the pandemic, I have not been hearing much back from employers, and so I'll be graduating without a job in my field most likely. 

I was wondering if anyone had any experience working as a process chemist and can share their experiences, such as what the working conditions were like, pay, opportunity for promotions, and whether or not the experience was relevant in other positions/places of employment.

For context, one of the jobs I was looking at is for Gelest in the U.S, east PA. They have openings for process chemists requiring an associates degree, but preferring a bachelor's. The description says I'll be trained ""in the areas of synthetic chemistry and silicone polymer chemistry,"" and I'll ""be trained to independently carry out chemical reactions, perform purification techniques and evaluate analytical results of synthesized products.""

I will also need to be able to ""lift loads of up to 50 pounds,"" be ""responsible for operating various hand tools and pumps in a safe manner,"" and work a forklift, which seems odd. It seems like this job may be a cross between a white and blue collar position, (which I would be completely fine with, I need a job). I am concerned, however, that the job is actually just a blue collar job in chemical facility, and the chemical training mentioned would be merely about hazards. I would like some insight into whether I will gain any experience with *chemistry* that I can use in the future for other positions, and if this description is unusual for a process chemist, as I have not seen this in any other postings. If this is not going to supply me with experience in chemistry, I cannot imagine this position will advance my career opportunities.

TLDR; What have your experiences as process chemist been like (work conditions, pay, future opportunities) and is it unusual for a process chemist job description to include many blue collar job descriptions (lifting heavy loads, operating forklifts)?",7,2020-05-15 13:22:14,1,1,1,1,1

Has anyone ever completed an online biology program or does anyone recommend any? Thanks so much in advance!,1,2020-06-07 18:32:32,0,0,0,0,0
i9pjwl,Looking to get a degree in Chemistry,"Hello everyone! I need some advice if I am doing something stupid or if it will all work out in the end if I try hard enough. This post is going to be long as I need to hear what people think I should do (or not do hehe)

I’m 21 years old. I studied Nursing for 3 years but moved to America and had to start all over again. I took Pharmacology some AnaPhysio classes and other electives then I got a job in a hospital where we basically do what nurses do except for medication administration and other more rigorous responsibilities/heavier critical thinking. I did not like it; I discovered Nursing was not for me even when I am capable of doing the job well. I did not know that I was rushing myself to get my degree to take care of my family. I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ED, BDD, and social anxiety this year.

I’ve been thinking about getting a degree in History and specialize in Art History as humanities is more of my strength. I SUCK in Chemistry and Mathematics but I want to be in love with it. I love Science and I wanna learn about the littlest of things. I was thinking it may be a good change for me, something new and exciting to learn. I enrolled myself in AS in Science, and AAS in Biotechnology in a community college. Afterwards, I will get a job wit those degrees and pursue a BS in Chemistry - Biochemistry concentration (if I get accepted)

Here are my questions:
1. How stupid are my decisions?
2. If I work hard enough, can I do it? I’m DUMB in Chemistry but I wanna learn it. I’m basically starting from almost a nonexistent knowledge.
3. Are you happy with your studies/jobs? 
4. Do you have any advice?

Thank you so much!",3,2020-08-14 11:50:35,0,1,1,1,1

fuo5qz,Can You Recommend an Introductory Biology Course?,"Can you recommend a good intro bio MOOC or textbook? 

After being turned off of biology in high school, I am now coming back to it as an adult. I'm looking primarily for a motivating experience. For introductory courses, I think focusing on motivation - rather than foundations of the discipline - will actually cause more learning in the long-run, because students will want to keep learning.

I began the [Khan Academy lessons](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology) and still plan to go through them. I was expecting to be inspired by cool information about animals in the wild, the promise of understanding my own health, a take on cutting edge genetic engineering, etc. After such experiences I may want to develop a deeper understanding of those phenomena by studying more biology. Instead, I am pure *rote memorizing* properties of electrons, the London Dispersion Force, and a zillion different parts of the cell. This is exactly what made me lose interest in biology in high school.

gbhsol,Can whether or not a molecule will bind to a protein be calculated deterministically?,"I  know little to nothing about chemistry so forgive my ignorance.

From my limited understanding small molecules have certain shapes and proteins have complex shapes. Whether or not a small molecule will bind to a protein is determined by whether or not it will 'fit' into the protein at some place (is this correct?).

If this is the case, can we take a comprehensive list of all small molecules, build up their shapes in a computer, and then just try them all out against a protein of our choice to see if they can possibly bind? Meaning, whether or not they 'fit'? Or this what people already do?

Ultimately i'm trying to figure out if there is some calculation you just can use to find out if a small molecule will bind to a certain protein.

This may be a very simple question - so please forgive me. Any reading material is much appreciated, i'm not joking when I say I know nothing about chemistry.",6,2020-05-01 08:08:52,0,1,1,1,1

Also FIP has a life time recurrence which is what covid19 is seeming to have from recent reports.

fnrrir,Questions about dimethicone and its insolubility in water,"Hello, I'm wondering about dimethicone (and silicones in general) found in cosmetics such as deodorants and moisturizers. I read that dimethicone forms a water repellent film on skin. My concern is if this film completely blocks water from reaching any skin layer. So I thought I'd ask some chemists to help me understand silicones better. If anyone knowledgeable could please help answer these questions I would highly appreciate it:

1. If I were to apply deodorant with dimethicone, then I take a shower/wash my armpits with water - will the water not remove the deodorant/the film formed by the silicone? If the film is not washed off with water, how can I wash it off? 
2. Does the film **completely** block water from reaching the surface skin layer?
3. Do water based products with a dimethicone still form this water repellent film the same way as silicone based products? 

The questions might be silly but it is really important to me that I understand the effect of dimethicone. Thanks again!!",7,2020-03-23 15:55:32,1,1,1,1,1

So I have a project of etching silver using nitric acid . So I did studied chemistry but this experiment was something I had never done.  
In my country, you can't buy nitric acid due to safety reason but you can buy several nitrate salt. you can also easyly buy chlorhydric acid.  
My goal was to react dilute (23%) HCl with a excess of nitrate salt (sodium nitrate) to produce nitric acid and salt. As you know, silver don't like chloride at all and my goal was , after evrything had reacted, to distill of in order to get rid of the salt aand having pure nitric acid.  
Saddly this doesn't work well, I think I have a mix of nitric and chlorhydric acid at the end. I do get a lot of brown gaz in my apparatus (I use a lightly closed reflux system to react nitrate and HCl) though

fnqkhf,Could regular throat disinfection help against the coronavirus?,"The virus plays a *numbers game*. A game of exponentials. Of course the idea is nothing new. We have all seen the graphs. We know that the more time it has to spread, the more new victims it can infect.

This also means that the earlier we stop the spread, the less severe the overall effect.  
That's why prevention (like washing hands, staying away from others etc.) is so important.

The problem though is that you need only slip up a few times and you are out of the *numbers game* \- the virus plays it without you from then on. Washing your hands helps little when you are infected already.

When that happens, we basically accept that the virus will run it's course. The best we can do is isolate, help with the symptoms and the complications - and hope.

*Does this need to be the case?* Isn't it possible to do something even after contracting the virus?

Just to recap in very simple terms, how does the infection occur? Most of the time we introduce the virus ourselves by touching our eyes, nose and mouth. Sometimes we inhale it via contaminated air.

The eyes are probably the least of our concerns. They are are fairly well isolated from the rest of the body and while infection through the eyes can't be ruled out, until we know better we probably shouldn't focus on it too much.

The nose has fairly efficient defense mechanisms already but more importantly the nasal cavity and the mouth meet at the same place - the throat.  
**Basically the throat is the gateway into our body.** And the main entry (and exit!) point for the virus as well.

Here comes the important part. Even in the throat the rules of the *numbers game* apply.  
The virus starts to multiply and as time goes on, progresses deeper - into the stomach (where it usually gets destroyed) and to the lungs where - in serious cases - it can wreak havoc.  
Unfortunately, once the virus reaches this point we usually no longer try to play the *numbers game* against it.

But why not? Can't we stay in the game? How?  
**Throat disinfection. Regularly.** Several times a day.  
The latter is key for three simple reasons:

1. The sooner you do this if you contract the virus, the more efficient it is. (A basic rule of the *numbers game*.) You can't really know right away when you get the virus. But you don't need to, if you do disinfection regularly.
2. It's proportion based. You need many repetitions to achieve good efficiency. Of course the real dynamic is more complicated but for simplicity's sake: if you kill a flat 40% of the virus in one go, you need five to kill \~90%.
3. The virus is doing it's thing too. It's basically a race where the opponent can get up and try again. The virus will do it. You should too.

That's why it's important to do it again and again. *Rinse and repeat.* Literally.

I'm not suggestion this could be a cure. But it could be something between prevention and treatment.

* It may help *you* as it may even kill the virus before it has a chance to spread. More likely it may slow it down to give enough time for your immune system to play it's own *numbers game* successfully.
* It may help *others* by decreasing the rate at which you infect those around you. Not only it helps if you can deal with the virus early on and stop spreading it. Your throat is also the primary source through which you infect others. Keep that to a minimum and you help everyone.

In principal we should always look for ways to stay in the game. Once the virus reaches the lungs, throat disinfection is no longer effective. Could we do something similar though? What about a sauna-like treatment (hot and moist air)? Or maybe we could come up with a gaseous disinfectant that is safe to inhale.

**Debate**

1. **Argument:** This cannot work because most of the viruses are inside the cells.  
**Answer:** True - the second part that is. A virus infection has a constant dynamic. Infected cells pop one after the other releasing new viruses into the environment while at the same time in said environment free viruses continuously attack healthy cells.  
But just because you can't attack the viruses *inside* the cells, doesn't mean there's no point in attacking those that are *outside*.  
It's about disturbing this dynamic. Maybe can't eliminate the entire virus population, but again - this is about *numbers*. You don't need to achieve 100% efficiency to have positive effect. If you have a *reasonable* efficiency - you can increase it. By repetition. The key is to slow it down to give enough time for the immune system.
2. **Argument:** You lost me with the sauna nonsense. It's a debunked hoax, everyone knows that.  
**Answer:** First, I'm not saying sauna as a cure is feasible. On that later.  
Second, the sauna debunking is hardly scientific itself. Noone claims this has been really tested. The argument is mostly something like ""there is no scientific evidence that high temperature kills the coronavirus."" Except it's an established scientific fact that viruses in general *do* have a certain temperature sensitivity.  
A 60-80 °C hot air in the lungs may not kill even the majority of the free viruses, let alone all of them (not to mention the ones inside the living cells), but why don't we consider less than 100% efficiency? If it *can* kill a *reasonable* portion of it - we can play the *numbers game*. Rinse and repeat.  
The fact is we don't know the dynamics. We know simple facts like the coronavirus *can* infect people in hot and humid environments. But what are the *numbers*? Is it as efficient as in cold and dry environments?  
Third, it's about the principle. The sauna might very well be something that has absolutely no positive effect. The question still remains - is there a way to *stay in the game*?",3,2020-03-23 14:48:46,0,0,0,0,0

hccsj6,"What exactly is Quantum field theory, and why is it important?","I have recently been reading about Quantum Field Theory, Quantum Electrodynamics, and Quantum Chromodynamics. I am a 100% newbie to it, so its A LOT for me right now. 

I have seen that one example as to why this theory is so important is because of how it debunks the idea of ""action at a distance"". But I'm not too sure WHY or HOW. I know the idea of a field explains that all things within it have an effect on eachother,  but why exactly is this?

I am also caught in a conflict. Some sources I look at explain QFT to explaim the nature of things strictly through the use of fields. As in, all particles are a result of an excitation on their respective field. But some sources say that the theory explains the nature of things in a sense that makes field arbitrary - that all things act upon eachother, not because of fields, but because of particles that mediate force. I thought the entire purpose of QFT was to show us that particles aren't really a thing at all, instead FIELDS are a thing, and everything we consider ""particles"" are just a manifestation of this field as a result of vibrations. 

Next question, where do these excitations that manifest particles come from?

Next question all fields have an effect on eachother (if this is what QFT is about)?  As in, will a great enough disturbance in the electron field, have an effect on possible the electromagnetic field - resulting in photons visible to us as light?

Lastly, how many fields are there believed to be currently? 

If you read this all the way through, thank you. And all the help is appreciated, and if youre not sure how to explain it, I would equallt appreciate some sources. Have a great day.",0,2020-06-19 19:55:41,2,2,2,2,2

g0s4ns,Suggestions on things to read/study to better prime me for organic chemistry coursework?,"Hey all,

I'm an adult student currently nearing completion of a BS in biology. One thing I have put off until now is the chemistry coursework, and I will be taking Organic Chem 1 in the fall, followed by part two in my final semester. Thus far I have done well in my first two undergrad chem courses, really only struggling with some of the math since I don't study. Conceptually, I'm ahead of most of the class. 

My concern is that up until this point I have been succeeding primarily due to being a lifelong science enthusiast. I'm an avid reader and hobbyist chemist, as well as a very advanced hobbyist pyrotechnician. While I have learned a lot in my first two chem courses, much of it felt more like connecting the dots than learning fresh concepts since I already had a strong foundation of the basics (even some more complex chemistry concepts). I fear that I have been coasting a bit up until this point, and as I mentioned I don't really study at all so I miss a few math-heavy problems on every test. My lab and homework/participation points are always very high though so I still get A's.

I'm looking for some guidance as to what sorts of literature or concepts I can begin looking over now to build up my knowledge base before Organic Chemistry. I hear a lot of horror stories and while I am a high-GPA student, I am not a *good* student. It would help me greatly to know that I'm going into organic with a decent foundation so that if my study habits get the best of me I still pass the courses.

Any suggestions on anything at all would be appreciated, and I'm talking everything from academic papers to Wikipedia articles to novels. Even just a few bullet points of major concepts that I can individually research would be helpful since essentially I have no idea what to expect beyond ""the next step in chemistry"". Should I memorize all the functional groups I can? Study molecular structure? That sort of thing.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.",10,2020-04-13 16:32:19,1,1,1,1,1

And this is one thing that really bugs me: I've never understood why it is a big deal that information is apparently destroyed inside a black hole... Why information cannot be destroyed? Why is it a ""paradox""?

Information getting destroyed is something we see everyday! Whether ""information"" is an object, or a set of objects set in a specific order to create information, all these can be destroyed! That's what entropy is about! when you burn a CD, you destroy that information, and there is no way to retrieve it back! The only way to retrieve it is that you kept a perfect mapping and perfect tracking of every atom in the CD... and that's a big ""if"". Because that's the exact flaw that I see in the statement ""information cannot be destroyed"": **information doesn't persist without work! You need to do work just to preserve information.** So why on earth do scientists go around saying something that is clearly false?

I get it that this violates some principles of Quantum Mechanics. But guess what, Quantum Mechanics is a model to understand the world and not the other way around. If entropy and information getting destroyed are incompatible with Quantum Mechanics, then **why don't scientists jus accept that Quantum Mechanics has it's limits?**

g844q3,An Island Nation with Legalized Drugs," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

fjjjdj,covid 19 cure found in yogurt and kefir," 

The actual active ingredient for a drug for acute treatment and prophylactic application, is already known to medical scientists around the world as GAMMA-INTERFERON.

This substance GAMMA-INTERFERON must now only be isolated by the responsible specialists and separated from the corresponding products, which contain this high-quality defence substance against pathogens, in order to then process it into a corresponding medicine, which can be administered to humans.The substance GAMMA-INTERFERON is a natural product of chemical transformation, e.g. when milk is converted to YOGURT or KEFIR. So it is only necessary that the GAMMA-INTERFERON is removed from the mentioned products and converted into a drug.this GAMMA-INTERFERON is practically the same antidote or anti-substance against pathogens as it is produced by the human immune system itself.it also works in the same way as the natural products in terms of antibodies and defences of the human immune system.

The effect is even better if the drug is taken in larger controlled and appropriate amounts. It is able to prevent almost any disease and to nip it in the bud, even cancer of any kind, because when taken and used in appropriate quantities, it is able to destroy even the most persistent viruses, not to mention less resistant pathogens.

the high consumption of pure yogurt or kefir is the only benefit as of now. because these drugs are not done entirely correctly to work 100%.

My experience.. 
I’m a biomedical Science student so I never dissected anything. I was required to look and feel. Along with a theory test, we had to do a physical, but there was no dissection.

Towards the end I enjoyed it more than I did at the start. It took me a while. I went in pretty depressed, and it made me think.... we either end up below the ground or like this.. what’s the point!? It made my depression much worse. However I got better, and I started enjoying it more.

For me, the toughest part was the flesh. Specifically the muscles. It was rough. My favourite part was the first time seeing the spinal cord. Just like a sting ray tail. Amazing! I also love the CV system so seeing the heart was great... the blood vessels, not so much. But for sure, the muscles were my least fav. They were also the thing I had to spend the most time on because we had to name every one- deep, superficial and medial- so we had to view them a lot... I hated it.

Also, I will never, ever , forget the smell. I know it’s all the preservative, but it’s disgusting. Everytime I have to use that squirt disinfectant soap, it puts me right back in that lab. Eh.

I am in a biomedicine degree so I’m not in medical school to be a doctor. I just have a very big interest in medical science. I’ll never have to cut through a body, so I’m lucky and didn’t have to dissect or cut any of the cadavers.. Theory is my main thing and I don’t have to do the physical as much. And even though I enjoyed the lab at the end, three full semester of it was enough for me and I don’t think I will ever steps foot in one again.. I hope !

Please skip to the last paragraph to go directly to the question I am seeking the answer to. For background, please continue reading.

I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Physical Sciences. Turns out, I haven't been able to ace my grades, but they aren't trash either. Circumstances prevent me from enrolling into a PhD right now (owing to Covid-19 qnd other factors). This means I am basically useless for the next 6 months, maybe even an year. I will be taking up research projects, but there's one more thing I absolutely must and need to do.

I need a complete refresher of all the physics and mathematics I've learnt till now. I recently faced an interview and in spite of acing an exam in Quantum Field Theory, I stuttered while answering on basic concepts like inertial frames. The issue, as I figured was not that I didn't know it, but it was all so long ago and I have got lost in so many technicalities of physics since then, that I have messed up my basics. Hence I need a complete reading and study list to get going on a full refresh from high school physics, uptill graduate level physics. Feynman's lectures are definitely something I must complete throughly, alongwith as much of Landau Lifshitz as I can. But what else? Are there like ""must read for physicists"" stuff? Are there problem books that I must complete? In brief, what I qm asking for is a comprehensive liet of all that I need to do so that at the end of one year I have all five years of my Physics training at my fingertips, which I am sure many of you will agree doesn't haooen for most right after graduating.

In my backyard I have a loquat tree and when I harvested the fruit I saved all the seeds! But because I dont have room for 300 seeds to be planted in pots right now, I put most of them in paper towels in a bag or in sphagnum moss in my greenhous, and then a handful in some pots outside, I live in texas so it's quite hot here! And man have they all grown different! The ones that were in soil got knocked over and washed out of the pots during a storm so I could see how they're growing. They have 1 thick root going straight down. Pretty typical I believe for plants outside. The ones in paper towels have tons of roots! But theyre all very thin. They have roots clinging onto other seeds and through the paper towel. And the ones in sphagnum moss are very similar, lots of skinny roots. And some of the ones in moss seem to maybe have a bit of a shoot? I'm not sure yet! 

I thought it was interesting to see how they're all growing so different in different environments!",0,2020-05-25 22:15:07,0,0,0,0,0
hzc51h,Using copper acetate instead of sulfate in iron displacement reaction,"Hey everyone, simple as it can be -&gt; I want to do the electrochemical experiment of copper plating an iron nail in a copper salt solution (let the nail sit in the salt solution and watch copper build on the nail). Usually people use copper sulfate (unfortunately not in stock). **Is there any practical limitations using copper acetate instead?** 

From my point of view, there should not. Maybe the color of iron sulfate is a little off in comparison and maybe the equilibrium is a little off (so maybe its slower). The acetate is a little more toxic than the sulfate, so maybe thats a reason too that you dont see it often to be used?",3,2020-07-28 05:17:04,1,1,1,1,1

h78s7r,A Zoophile (animal sex lover) on Reddit once said...,"&gt;The gist of zoonosis is that if the animal has a zoonotic disease, you're going to get it from simply being around them and taking care of them as opposed through only sexual contact. There is no zoonotic disease that is ONLY transmitted through sexual contact. There are vaccines for most of them, and even ignoring that, they mainly crop up in third world countries or when someone is neglecting an animal. Further, if one is afraid of zoonotic diseases due to bestiality, if the person is being consistent, then they're hopefully a lifelong celibate vegan who lives isolated from other people. You're far more likely to get sick from eating undercooked/contaminated animal products, being around other humans, or having sex. 

&gt;Ah, now you've admitted to it being gross and illegal. Gross shows you're being bigoted (reason why homosexuality was banned). And btw, legality doesn't equal right or wrong so you can't really use that in the argument (again gay marriage used to be illegal in the US). All ZOOSEXUALS are kind and never force sex on their partners, whom they love &amp; very likely take better care of than non-zoos do with their pets. As zoosexuals, we hate the ones that hurt animals. Just like we'd hate human rapists.

&gt;Zoosexuality isn't a mental disorder. Most zoos are perfectly happy and healthy, even as they speak about it with their therapists. Saying that all zoos are mentally ill is literally just like how we used to say all gays were mentally ill. All in all, in the future I can see a society where we'd finally realize that zoosexuality is a valid sexual orientation and only ppl who ACTUALLY hurt their animals will go to jail/pet taken away. Ppl will look back to this time period and can't believe so many people were against zoosexuals.

Consider that the air that gets trapped in between both pipes does not circulate and it will be ""stuck"" absorbing the heat. Will this air dampen the desired effect of heating my home or with a given time both alternatives would be the same?

THE COLIN LESLIE DEAN SPECIES PARADOX

The first humans Adam and Eve gave birth to Cain and Able
so who did Cain mate with

similarly

who did the first bird mate with who did the first dog mate with

an individual of species A gives birth to a individual of the new species B so who did this new individual of new species B mate with to continue the new species
either

1)there was no one to mate with- so how did the new species B become common

or

2)a whole lot of species A gave birth toa whole lot of new individuals of species B at the same time so that these new individual members of species B could mate together

if this 2) was the way it happened
we have a major problem

it would mean something made a whole lot of members of species A give birth to a whole lot new members of species B at the same time

we are told species form due to random mutations

so

it is beyound possibility that the same random mutation took place in a whole lot of different members of species A at the same time

the other alternative is that some intelligence was at work

NOW
There is a  a dilemma

1)in order to resolve the dean paradox
the dean paradox makes you abandon the word species 
in which case  biology is destroyed

or 

2)biology  uses the word bird 
signifying it is different from its parent organism
science uses the word species

as such

you have the dean paraodox

We're supposed to wash our own stainless steel plates at the mess I eat due to the lockdown. They fill up some random plastic bottles with soap solution which we use to wash our plates. Someone left a 7UP bottle filled with a viscous, greenish liquid which I accidentally poured onto my plate. The workers say that liquid is 'phenyl' and they use it to clean toilets. I did not study chemistry at school, but I assume they probably meant a phenol-based disinfectant, which is toxic to humans iirc.

I washed that liquid off with running water, and then washed the plate for a few minutes with the soap solution they provided. Since there's a shortage of plates, I can't get a new one. 

Can I still use that plate to eat food? If not, are there any ways in which I can remove the traces of the disinfectant?

fscir6,The best you can do to fight SARS-COV-2 is... nothing? Are preprint papers really needed?,"I've taken inspiration from [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/frsd16/the_best_thing_you_can_do_to_fight_covid19_is/) from our /r/Physics brothers and sisters, that I recommend you to read. I'm not a great writer, I'll try to be as clear as I can.

Our job (organic, medicinal, computational... whatever floats your boat) is **crucial** in this time of need. And for this reason, we need to be careful with what we say.

Similarly to [this physics preprint service](https://arxiv.org), this [chemistry preprint server](https://chemrxiv.org) is slammed with [new research](https://chemrxiv.org/?q=title%3A%22COVID-19%22%20OR%20title%3A%22SARS%20COV%202%22%20OR%20title%3A%22coronavirus%22%20OR%20description%3A%22COVID-19%22%20OR%20description%3A%22SARS%20COV%202%22%20OR%20description%3A%22coronavirus%22&amp;searchMode=1) everyday. 

Now, I (as a lowly PhD student) am not in the position of deciding whether a piece of research is ""good"" or not, nor if it really shows the ""urgency"" that these kind of services were made for. But what if the computational paper **you** published there, suggesting that the pharmaceutically active ingredient of a simple cough syrup could prevent the entry of the virus in the cells, is picked up by a journalist in need of something to write on? What if that article pushes people to drink cough syrup as if it is nothing, due to the fear of contracting the virus?

For sure, the ""Big Pharma"" would have evaluated the exact same scenario, reaching the conclusion that the cough syrup wouldn't have been an effective cure and was not worth pursuing further. And now, bypassing all that rational thinking, your preprint paper pushed people into potentially poisoning themselves.

So, is a ""not-so-valuable"" publication worth the lives of people? What do you think?",25,2020-03-31 08:02:47,0,2,2,2,1

fkptvu,Immortality theory,"
Removing some stem cells from this genus of jellyfish, then inserting them in a human embrio is the leading theory on how to make homosapiens immortal.


Turritopsis dohrnii is now officially known as the only immortal creature. The secret to eternal life, as it turns out, is not just living a really, really long time. It’s all about maturity, or rather, the lack of it. The immortal jellyfish (as it is better known popularly) propagate and then, faced with the normal career path of dying, they opt instead to revert to a sexually immature stage.

It turns out that once the adult form of the 4.5 mm-wide species Turritopsis dohrnii have reproduced, they don’t die but transform themselves back into their juvenile polyp state.

grfsov,Time Travel and the Grandfather Paradox,"Hello Physicists!

I am a writer, and I am, for the first time, dipping my toes in the water writing a story that largely concerns time travel. I'm working on a story where my protagonist invents a time travel device and I'm trying to think of a way she could use it without creating a paradox. It's not really an idea I've played with before and I feel like I need some expert advice here!

My question is if my protagonist were to use her device to travel to a point in time preceding the dawn of mankind (i.e. the late Mesozoic era) before a mass extinction event using a portable time-travel device would she be able to travel backward and forward in time between these points (our present and the Mesozoic era) without incurring the Grandfather Paradox or the Butterfly Effect? My reasoning here is that any action my protagonist made while in the past would have little to no implication to the future timeline as the upcoming extinction event being both natural and inevitable is a fixed point that, in my estimations, effectively erases any and all action made by my protagonist.

I just want some reassurance that I am correct about my thought process here.

I run a youtube channel called Gumball Degree and I'm making a youtube video about acids and bases in regards to how it reacts in water. I know this sounds slightly more geared to chemistry but my video is currently about biology so I'll ask here. This is how I understand it.

When we introduce NaOH into water, it dissociates into Na+ and OH- ions. According to the Bronsted-Lowry Definition. A base is the molecule that ACCEPTS a proton. But how does it accept a proton when its in water? The answer is that we know that water sometimes have its own reactions between itself. A process that looks like this: 2\*H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH-. This reaction usually occursnot often but since NaOH also results in OH- ions, we see that NaOH's OH- ion is able to accept a proton and turn into H2O and this is why NaOH is a base in water. But the overall solution will have plenty of left over OH- because of this",5,2020-07-06 17:13:46,1,1,1,1,0

grmke6,"Implications of many-worlds interpretation, discussion","Lately there's been a lot of discussion about many-worlds interpretation in the public, like the veritasium video with millions of views and recently pushed by Sean carroll and other experts.

If there was a copy of me in another part of the normal universe (our branch), it was just like me in every aspect, but ultimately made from different parts of the universe so if I die, that one would remain alive, but it's not me. 

**But in the case of many-worlds**, some parallel me's would be exact copies of  me in every aspect physically, but also made of the same parts of the universe being at 2 places at the same time, making me all of them at the same time? wouldn't it imply immortality? Sean carroll and most defenders nowadays seem to suggest that it's not like that and that the branches are completely independent, meaning that we just die in our branch and that's it, but I don't understand why it is like that, since I don't have much knowledge about quantum mechanics.

 Can someone explain me? This idea of living forever is **completely terrifying**. Consciousness being most likely just physical (as even Sean believes) and the branches being the same particles in different places at the same time, wouldn't imply we will consciously experience all those that remain conscious for eternity? These implications if true are devastating.

fwt3is,"Choosing between engineering, physics and math for undergrad?","Hey everyone, gr11 Canadian student here, long story short but basically I've been spending the extra time on my hands thinking about post-secondary (haven't thought about this until now). So after lots of browsing around on reddit, uni program descriptions, course lists, etc. I think I've brought it down to engineering, physics, and math and I was wondering what your opinions were between these 3 (fyi, double major isn't an option at the universities here that I want to go too).

Just some background that may be helpful: since like forever I've always been fascinated by machines - I used to draw planes in elementary school and since middle school I've been making random electronic things (like a little solar-powered desk bladeless fan). Based on this, I feel like engineering may be the right choice because of its hands-on nature, but at the same time math is hands down my first ""true"" passion, as cheesy as it sounds. As a kid I was really introverted (still am) so one day decided to check out Khan Academy and I got addicted to it lol. Been doing math ever since (contests, uni lecture notes, etc). A part of me loves the idea of just sitting down for hours at a time working through things like curl or series. BUT, when I was introduced to physics in gr9 (circuits) I was again just... mesmerized. Just the idea of electrons in a wire or why gravity's equation is the way it is, etc.

Now, this is getting long, but here's some unrelated info: even though I'm extremely introverted as a ""person"", that's not the case with group projects etc. Another thing regarding math - I need the proof or at least intuition of formulas (ex. if you plop cosine law in front of me for the first time I just ""must"" try to find a proof/search it up if I can't), but at the same time I'm not sure if very abstract stuff is my thing (like sets). Finally, I know people say follow your passion but truth is, I want to make a decent amount of money mostly just to give back to my parents and because of their struggles - they were first generation immigrants (btw they don't care what I do as long as I have a stable job in the end). P.S. (sorry!) I have very high 90s in STEM courses so I think all 3 fields are pretty open to me.

Enough. Either someone is pulling stunts with some creative use of physics and the civilian scientific body has been hung out to dry in the dark, or there is a concerted effort by multiple entities to perpetrate a hoax on the american public. Except that every single hoaxster is pointing the finger at plasma manipulation combined with some sort of electrical field as being the key innovative breakthrough here. 

I did further digging, and found this paper, which might be of serious interest to some of you. I know enough to be dangerous, not enough to fact check it. [https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0701/0701091.pdf](https://arxiv.org/ftp/physics/papers/0701/0701091.pdf) 

Anyways, I know there are probably at least one or two college physics professors here who would love to get their hands on free money to do something flashy with their class. Here is my proposal. If you can read through this mumbo jumbo, decipher it, and come up with some experiments that can recreate the effects that are being proposed here, I will throw money at you. Not insane amounts of money, I am a working dude with a day job. However, I am tired of seeing all these papers come out and have the military dropping hints left right and center it has a way to use this tech to more efficiently murder their enemies, and civilian space travel is getting none of it. If this is fake, I want to test it, video tape the tests and debunk these papers once and for all. If it's real, it shouldn't only be in the hands of people who murder other people as their dayjob. &gt;:(

P.S. I am going to start with the offer of $500. I will require videos of the experiments, and I want to see a bill of what was bought with the money, but if you can get proof of this working for under $500, you can spend it on hookers and blow for all I care. If you have interesting results, and other ideas you want to test, I might be willing to sponsor more. 

PPS. If anyone wants to step up and match me, so we can get good lab equipment, I would be more than happy. I only ask that you don't rush in. I will announce who I have chosen to fund, and you are free to make your own funding choices. Fund the idea, not the specific people, if we can have 2-3 seperate teams working independent from each other, but open to the other people's research, so much the better. 

PPPS. If this blows up and we discover revolutionary tech, the profits should be split equally among everybody involved. I might be the one throwing money at the problem, but that doesn't mean it only belongs to me. Everyone should have a piece of the pie.

I did go through previous questions in the catalog but I guess my situation is a little different than the questions I have been looking at. It will be great if I could get some insight from people who have much more experience in physics than I do to begin yet another adventure in physics :).

To begin the post here is a little background about myself -:

1. I am 30 year old
2. I am a programmer working for a company (mostly spend time writing code)
3. I have had experience with studying physics previously (as part of my high school curriculum to crack some entrance examinations)
4. I have only figured out a little late in life how curious I am about the world and nature in general.
5. And only lately realized how physics could help me understand things a little better.
6. Back in high school I was never good at physics, I was able to score well but I guess I wasn't able to understand all the concepts properly.

Now a little about what I am looking to do -:

1. I want to get back to studying physics from the ground up (concepts like kinematics, work, energy etc... and just want to know more in general on anything I can lay my hands on)
2. I need to start somewhere and hence looking for some book recommendations. (After some research I came across this book named **Halliday, Resnick and Walker** but I would love to know more references in terms of video, text, books, articles etc... anything that can help me gain some vigor about the subject)
3. I would like to think that I am good at math as I always have scored well in math both in high school, college and my masters degree. (Agreed, I a very rusty currently w.r.t advanced math skills that might be required but I would like to think that I can pick them up along the way. Any references here would be of great help :).)

P.S.: Last but not the least I would like to ask all of you if attempting to regain my interest in the subject a little too late at this age. I believe most people do most of their fascinating work in the field when they start out young. I think I am not studying with the attempt to shatter the world with ground breaking physics and coming up with something really original. But I do want to go through text and content that has been thought, organized and produced over the years by other brilliant minds to understand the world a bit better.",9,2020-07-10 09:30:39,2,2,2,2,2

hw18wr,Should I go out of my way to directly email faculty whose work I’m interested in?,"Hi all!

I’m a recent first gen biochem graduate, and I’m looking at PhD programs. There’s plenty that catch my eye, from the campus communities to the research; however, I’m having trouble thinking about whether reaching out to faculty of interest is worth the time. Either way, I’m going to read their papers and research summaries for my statements that are included in application requirements. Some say to email if you have an interest in joining the lab, but I wouldn’t be rotating until next fall. Is it worth it, or are there even worthwhile questions to ask if so much is unknown? Did any of you? In the case of molecule bio type programs, is it better to just apply with faculty in research statements rather than approaching them directly to express interest? My thought was initially to make myself stick out from the pack, but I fear it may not be effective.

In the explanation, include where these sub-processes occur and what products are formed in connection with the different sub-reactions.","1. Describe in detail the three sub-processes in the cell's energy recovery that result in the formation of ATP in our cells. In the explanation you should include where these sub-processes occur and what products are formed in connection with the different sub-reactions.

&gt;Plants absorb carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates in the form of potatoes, rice and wheat or fruits and vegetables. These carbohydrates are sugar, in the form of glucose, and when we eat it, you get ATP formation in the cells to help with cellular respiration. Here's how it works: When we get glucose, we end up in a phase called glycolysis that breaks down glucose to form 2 molecules of pyruvic acid, and this occurs in cell plasma in both animal and plant cells. During cell respiration, oxygen from the environment is used to convert pyruvate into three molecules of carbon dioxide while storing energy during this process, which is ATP. In the citric acid cycle, you can also get ATP, and this happens in the mitochondria. In the mitochondria, the CO2 of the pyruvic acid from glycolysis is needed to form molecules with two carbon atoms, and coenzyme a is coupled to CO2 and then called acetyl-CoA. Now that we have acetyl-CoA, the citric acid cycle begins where the acetyl group is coupled with oxalacetic acid with its 4 carbon atoms, and finally, we get citric acid with 6 carbon atoms. Enzymes in the body then help break down the citric acid into oxalacetic acid again and two molecules of CO2, in the same vein, the hydrogen atoms are released to 4 hydrogen carriers and energy to the ATP molecule for each turnover on the pyruvic acid molecule. The citric acid cycle continues in this way as long as one has access to pyruvic acid through glucose.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;During the electron transport or the breathing chain, etc., you can also get ATP. This, with the help of oxygen. The electron transport takes place in a mitochondrial membrane, of which there are then proteins that have electrons at their disposal and can move them, hydrogen atoms that you get from the citric acid cycle can be used for the electron transport when hydrogen carriers give these hydrogen atoms to the proteins in the form of the e- (electron) and H + charges. (proton). The electrons are sent to the proteins to run out of oxygen that receives the electrons, the reaction is as follows 2H + + 1/2 O2 + 2e- -&gt; H2O In the proteins that the electrons pass through to the oxygen, their energy is lost, which is energy that the proteins had at their disposal to send protons H + through the mitochondria, but too many protons can be formed in the mitochondria, which leads to ATP being formed from ADP with the help of mitochondrial membranes and enzymes.

gyerg4,Observational relativity in the definition of entropy,"I have been thinking about the definition of entropy recently and have come across an interesting thought experiment that leads me to believe I don't have a complete grasp on it.  I want to preface this by saying I am a recently graduated Bachelors in chemistry, and have taken an intro to statistical mechanics but definitely am not any sort of expert.

Consider a set of N distinguishable, noninteracting point particles in a box with volume V.  These particles can be distinguished and tracked, the mechanism of which is irrelevant; to give a physical grounding, lets say they all fluoresce at distinct wavelengths.  Let us initially assume we are ignorant to these wavelengths or for some reason cannot track the particles; that is, although they are technically distinguishable, they appear indistinguishable to us.  Then statistical theory says the entropy of the system will be proportional to ln(V^N) as the system relaxes to thermal equilibrium.

Now, say we are suddenly made aware of the fluorescent wavelength of one of these particles; using this information we are able to track it's position and infer it's momentum.  To simplify the argument, I will ignore quantum effects and allow this precision to be arbitrarily good.  Then we can consider the system to be composed of two subsystems, that of the distinguished particle and that of the other N-1 particles.  As entropy is additive in independent systems, this system now has entropy proportional to ln(V^(N-1) + 0) (as there is no uncertainty in the position and momentum of the distinguished particle).  This procedure can be repeated for any subset of the particles to give many different values for the entropy.

Nothing has changed about the physical system other than our knowledge of it, but many different values for it's entropy are obtained.  This seems to indicate an inconsistency in the definition of entropy dependent only on our awareness of and ability to measure information about the system.  Can anybody help me to understand where my thought experiment fails or otherwise better understand entropy in relation to information known about the system?

3: There is absolutely no precedent for this in nature. All animals that regrow their limbs simply do it from the stumps. Humans too, we grew them from ""stumps"" as fetuses.

I discovered two in my horses water bucket, thankfully it was empty.  As soon as I tipped it the bigger (assuming adult) flew away but the assumed juvenile did not.  I helped them out but they didn’t really fly (or struggled to).  I attempted to help that one climb but she got into a small space and I left her alone. While moving something in the barn I discovered ANOTHER juvenile which rushed to crawl into that same space.  There was nothing I could do so we just moved things away and called it a day. The adult flew away about 30 minutes later and seemed fine so we figured if they were related that evening they’d figure out how to get out.  That PM we didn’t see anyone and hoped for the best.  

On day 3 there was a bat crawling around but away from the barn so I didn’t think they were related but it was odd.  I lost that bat before I could get a stick and didn’t find a dead bat later so I assumed he managed to fly away.  
This past Wednesday (day 5) in the AM we found a dead bat and I took it to get tested for rabies.  Because of the American holiday I assume I won’t know an answer until later next week.   But today I found another dead bat (day 8) this time inside the barn.  
I wonder if this one is a result of the fireworks BUT, the other bat encounters make me suspicious that something is going on with our population. 

This morning we also found a LOT more droppings in the barn from last night so I am assuming a lot of bats came in to take cover from the fireworks??  If anything we definitely had an increase in bat activity last night per all the droppings. 

I suspect the ones we saw are little brown bats (if that helps to know what kind they might be) 
Rabies is of course a worry (I’ve been vaccinated and got a booster to be safe) but my other concern is some disease that could severely hurt our bat population.  

I plan to take the second one to be tested as well but I wanted to post this on here incase someone knows something about diseases in bats.  We are concerned for their safety as well as ours and our horses. 
Anyone have any ideas what could be happening?  

Also fireworks here didn’t really start until around July 1st so I do not believe that the first encounter has anything to do with fireworks.

Does anyone know to calculate how fast a reaction control system on a ship accelerates the ship in the roll axis?

Also, assuming the rotation of the ship is stationary, how fast will the ship be rotating around the roll axis (°/s) after, say, 10s of continuous firing.

g0gonr,How do oxidizers like hydrogen peroxide strip the oxide layer of copper?,"May sound like a dumb question, but hear me out.
Last year, I had a need for some copper (ii) chloride so following Nurdrage's method, I reacted copper with hydrochloric acid using H2O2 to strip the oxide layer allowing the acid to react with the raw copper. 
Curious about whether or not this worked with all oxidizers, I later tried it with a pinch of potassium chlorate to see what would happen. It worked very well with so much CuCl2 being produced some of it precipitated out of solution! It also produced a bit of potassium chloride which stuck around as an impurity though, so not the cleanest way of doing things. It also produces chlorine gas, but the amount of KClO3 I used was practically nothing and I was in a well ventilated area, so the risk was minimal.

But up until now, I assumed that this worked because it _oxidized_ the oxide layers into elemental copper. 
CuO+H2O2--&gt;Cu+O2+H2O
Using this assumption, I was going to recycle some copper oxide I produced as a waste byproduct into elemental copper, but before doing this I looked up the chemical equation to make sure my assumption was right. Turns out I was way off and it seems that, according to Google, all adding an oxidizer would just reduce CuO to Cu2O. 
H2O2+CuO--&gt;Cu2O+H2O+O2
Even more odd is the Science Madness claims CuO also reacts to form CuCl2, which flies in the face of all my assumptions for how this process works. 
Though I can't seem to find reliable sources for this information, so really I'm not sure which is right.

So what's really going on when I make CuCl? If the latter equation is correct, why does the hydrochloric acid only react with copper in the presence of an oxidizer? 

Bonus question: Is there a way to reduce CuO to elemental copper without using hydrogen at high temperatures? Working with hydrogen in an enclosed space is already a bit out of my comfort zone, so adding heat to it turns my ""no"" into a ""hell no!"" really quick.",4,2020-04-13 05:51:14,1,1,1,1,1

Now every time I work out I can see that my muscles can lift more and have more stamina, but they won't grow physically.

Now as you can see my problem is that I can not build muscle and I think the reason is that my metabolism is very high. I do not know much about what I should do, which is why I'm asking and I can't ask my doctor because he's working hard of course. 

So what should I do? Should I try to lower my metabolism for a while to be able to build muscle, how do I lower it and for how long? Should I wait till I get older to try and build muscle? Should I just keep doing what I'm doing and my body will start building muscle? As I said I can only see muscle performance growing, not the muscles growing in person, so should I just wait till my muscles reach their top performance in their current size before they will grow physically?

There's indirect pressure from my parents intriguing me to become a doctor, dont take me wrong id like to be one. However, what I really want is to play my cards right from the start. Both of these fields fascinate me, yet Im split between the two. Thus, I thought of asking this subreddit. Thanks :)

That's cool and everything, but what about the Infernal Menu?. What I learned in my GR class was that one of this had to not be true: Unitarity, Locality or Equivalence of all observers.

At first I thought the existence of these wormholes would break locality, I think, because they are sending information to places it would normally not reach... but then I thought about Penrose diagrams and how wormholes do not break Locality...

But then I thought, these wormholes are a two way street, information can come out, but it could also come in.

If Alice sees Bob falling into the blackhole and dying... later she could send him a message through a wormhole, and he would be able to reply... which would mean that Alice's observation of Bob dying was not correct... which means that Equivalence is not preserved...

Or I may be missunderstanding everything. I did take several classes about GR and QFT, I'm not just a science enthusiast, but this is obviously WAY more complex than anything I ever learned.",0,2020-07-10 14:26:31,2,2,2,2,2

gl4lpb,What's the correct answer to this biology exam question related to DNA and gel elctrophoresis? I got it marked wrong but I think my answer's the best answer possible.,"What causes the DNA samples to move through the gel?

&amp;#x200B;

a. molecular size and charge of the fragments

b. color of fragments

c. charge on the fragments

d. size of the fragments

&amp;#x200B;

I got it wrong. I think it's not a well written question in the first place. After initially marking ""molecular size and charge of the fragments"", I switched it to ""charge on the fragments"" and got it wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

I know DNA movement through the gel is determined by the charge as well as the size of fragments (smaller fragments move farther).

&amp;#x200B;

But the key word is ""causes""...what causes it (movement)? Different sizes of fragments don't \*cause\* them to move. Size merely facilitates how far the movement will be. You could have fragments that just size there because nothing (no charge) is causing them to move. Charges \*cause\* them to move because an opposite charge is set up on the other side.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I have a point?

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

I think my point is made even stronger because the question immediately following the first question was:

&amp;#x200B;

""What would cause one DNA sample to travel further than another?

a. smaller size

b. stronger charge

c. larger size

d. weaker charge""

And I put ""smaller size"". It was right, as it should be.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the second question was put there to clarify the first question.

Also, on the same exam, I said the following organism was a Protist. [https://www-hotmail-login.live/jurnal-euglena-70/](https://www-hotmail-login.live/jurnal-euglena-70/) (pic)

I got it wrong. I know it's Euglena, which has a flagellum. An Euglena is a Protist. Euglena was one of the answers, so I should've marked that. I honestly thought I did but apparently I didn't. I'm okay getting this marked wrong. Overall in my opinion Protist should've been taken off as one of the answer choices.

hzfo6m,What chemicals can be used to degrade C17H21NO4 beyond the recognition of a spectrometer?,"  Now, allow me to elaborate before any eyebrows are raised. I work in an industry that frequently remediates theft-recovered vehicles, drug labs, and other crime scenes to make them suitable for human habitation again. We use spectrometry to identify narcotics and the quantity that they exist within the environment. During the decontamination process we use a battery of chemicals which works wonderfully to destroy any trace of narcotic. However, the aforementioned chemical is notoriously difficult to entirely eliminate and we often find trace amounts in our post-test results. As a result we must decontaminate the area a second time to ensure our results come up completely negative.

  What chemical or combination of chemicals would best be used to remove any trace of the substance? Ideally, it should be non-toxic and leave upholstery unharmed. However, at this point I'm just curious either way.

Would I be a competitive applicant at a top school like MIT or Harvard, or should I set my sights a little lower? 

I am in the Commonwealth Honors College, have a 3.944 GPA, 4.0 major GPA, and a publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS). I have been working in a research lab on-campus since my freshman year and have worked full-time both summers. I will hopefully work this summer as well, CoV allowing. I think I can get another publication or two in if I return to the lab and work full-time.

i0twmb,Am I qualified enough for PhD programs?,"Hi, I’m currently attending school and will be getting my bachelors degree in biology this December. I’m doing the research and finding out what I need to do to apply. I really want to go somewhere where I will be fully funded and can focus on my schoolwork, because working a job while getting my undergrad has had an impact on my grades. I really just want someone who is knowledgeable in the area to review my qualifications and tell me what they think.

My GPA right now is at a 3.2, and I am expecting it to go up slightly because I’m working much less in the fall and will focus on school more. I’ve got about three cases of course based research:
1) in my microbiology lab I made a dilution series of the gut biome in a leech I extracted from a lake and ultimately isolated the DNA and identified the bacteria. I don’t have a paper for this one because it was a five week summer course and the professor didn’t require it.

I have not yet taken the GRE but a lot of schools I’m interested in don’t require it anyway. I am required to take it before I graduate though and will be providing it to schools who accept it. I’m a pretty terrible test taker but I’m hoping I can do okay on it.

I think they're absolutely fascinating and the prospect of working in a field of study for insects would make me very, very happy. However, I also love arachnids, crustaceans, and myriapods.

gtxqcp,"In a galvanic cell between Zn and Cu2+, which particles end up more stable and which (if any) end up less stable?","Hi all, 

Let's say we have a galvanic cell, say with Zn being oxidized and Cu2+ being reduced, the reaction leads to a more stable end result (Zn2+ + Cu) and the voltage produced being around 1V.

But if we split up the reaction which element actually get more stable, which get more unstable and by how much?

With my limited understanding of chemistry ions are often more stable as they often fulfill the octet rule, so I'd assume Zn gets more stable as Zn2+ and Cu2+ being less stable as Cu but not by as much since the net outcome is more stable) in this reaction. But then I also believe the newly formed metal bonds between the Cu atoms and the former metal bonds between the Zn atoms play a part here?

From Earth it effectively appears that Andromeda is standing still, since it takes millions of years to make one rotation. But if I was so large that the distances being covered by Andromeda were very small to me, would that change my perception of it’s motion because it would change my experience of the distances involved and also the passage of time from my reference point?

Conversely, if I shrank down so small that I could stand on an electron that was the relative size that Earth is to me now, would it seem to me that I was zipping around the nucleus at almost the speed of light, or much slower, due to my small size and the relative distances traveled?

Intuitively, both scenarios seem right to me, but I don’t know the physics well enough to say why. Very curious if any physicists have ever explored the nature of time when an object takes up a huge amount of space and can therefore cover large distances very quickly, but without moving very fast.

Would love to hear any thoughts on this or any suggestions about what I might read on the topic. Thanks.",2,2020-03-22 11:45:15,2,2,2,2,2

I am a high school student. This is the depth of my textbook's kidney subchapter:

&amp;#x200B;

Part 1: The role of the kidney in urine production.

\- The purposes of the kidney.

\- Nephron anatomy.

\- Urine-making operations: (filtration) + (re-absorption) + (tubular secretion).

&amp;#x200B;

Part 2: The role of hormones in regulating kidney function:

\- ADH.

\-RAAS.

\- ANF.

&amp;#x200B;

The textbook has no figures (pictures) to illustrate what is happening, and the few pictures it has are black and white and low resolution. I don't get what gets filtered, where and where/why it gets reabsorbed. And tubular secretion is too vaguely explained.

&amp;#x200B;

Last but not least, I don't understand anything on those ADH/RAAS/ANF hormones. When does each one fire? And what they actually increase/decrease? And which one counteracts each other?

gj7uv9,A potent anaesthetic,"Hello, I’m an 18 year old boy working on a chemistry project. I’ve been working on an arrowhead for hunting, not for game. The project itself is a multipart, disposable, attachable and a tranquilizing arrowhead. My design also needs to be able to paralyse a prey of about 100kg (220 pounds) beyond possibility of movement.

The arrowhead is about 1.9 cm long (3/4 inch) and about half a cm in width (0.2 inch). The arrowhead has a harpoonshape and is build to break at the base as soon as the animal starts running. This will open a valve containing a potent enaesthetic that stuns the animal for a (short) while, length of time is less of an issue here.

Now my calculations show that I have around a single mL, give or take a few punya decimals, to store the anaestethic, but here my problem comes into play: I do not have an easy way to get such a strong anaestethic, nor do I have the money to easily obtain some online. I do however have a small, but extensive home-lab, including safety measures of course.

Tl;dr
Does anybody know any cheap/ easily accassible anaethetic that can paralyse a 100kg (220 pounds) animal using about a mL of fluid?

Background: 
I am a college student who is studying vertebrate zoology and my academic plan is heavy on chemistry classes (chem 1, 2, orgo 1, 2). I am ahead in all my science classes except chemistry which is a problem and I am getting to the point where I can’t postpone any longer because I need it for my major classes.

I’ve been postponing it because when I took chemistry 1 in community college, we had a really awful professor. She didn’t let us do the labs ourselves, she would instead make us watch her do it and would often mess up the steps. When we had questions she often didn’t know how to answer them and would tell us to google it, or would give us a wrong answer. And she didn’t even have us get a text book and or mastering chem or wouldn’t give us access to the slides in class. Basically, she didn’t really teach us at all. She would just hand us the tests to memorize and put us in groups to study each class to read and study together (which as you can imagine didn’t work out well).

The tests were exactly the same as the exams. So we all memorized the exams and most of us got As in the class. Which was good for the GPA, but I was freaking out because I knew I was going to need chemistry moving forward so would try to self teach myself chemistry through YouTube videos. My problem I feel like I know a lot of random stuff but I have a really incomplete understanding of chemistry. I was in chem 2 for 1 weeks and dropped it because I knew I would fail because I was struggling with the review week.

So what should I do? Should I try to lower my metabolism for a while to be able to build muscle, how do I lower it and for how long? Should I wait till I get older to try and build muscle? Should I just keep doing what I'm doing and my body will start building muscle? As I said I can only see muscle performance growing, not the muscles growing in person, so should I just wait till my muscles reach their top performance in their current size before they will grow physically?

Those are a few questions I'm looking for answers to, so I thought this sub might be the right place (if not, please redirect me in the comment).

If you can answer any of the questions above, you're welcome to leave a comment, thanks.",0,2020-05-01 19:03:06,0,0,0,0,0

[ The spiral-shaped helices represent the cannabinoid type 1 receptor. This receptor is found in your brain. The purple, white and red spheres represent CP55,940 \(a synthetic cannabinoid\). When a person smokes or ingests cannabis the binding of THC to this part of the receptor produces the intoxication people refer to as “getting high”. The blue, pink, white and red spheres represent an experimental compound. When this compound is given to animals it binds to this part of the receptor and has been shown to reduce epileptic seizures.  ](https://preview.redd.it/c2eyvomuxqk41.jpg?width=779&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=036a750893b9162472beb6ca0dd3a93a879b71c2)",0,2020-03-04 18:12:47,1,0,0,0,0
gqy37o,My research on SARS-COV 2,"Hello. This whole message will contain research I’ve been working on since March. I’m a high school student and therefore don’t have any credentials to publish my work seriously. So I’ve opted to just make it public for use by any means I can. 

The Research:
It’s purpose is to find a cure and vaccine against COVID-19( I ended up finding a potential therapy and means to attenuate the virus ). 

The therapy:
It would include:
•1g(preferably in 4ml of water) of antibodies against the virus 
•0.5g(2ml) of antibodies against IL6
•0.5g(2ml) of antibodies against IL12

Reasoning:
1 The 1g of antibodies against virus

The plan was to aid in opsonisation of the virions. To do this I first tried looking at the viral load in conjunction with the number of spike proteins on each virion. However it was hard to make out how many spikes were present per virion. So instead I decided to look at the problems caused by the antibodies and try to avoid them. The only problem I came across was that the antibodies exert an osmotic pressure of (estimated) 50kPa(350mm Hg) when 250g of antibodies are present in 1L of water. Therefore 1g in 4ml would exert a pressure of 1.5mm Hg  I then needed to get the number of antibodies in 1g to see how it would fair against one of the recorded viral loads(Fatal incident) . So the estimated mass of one antibody is 150kDa and 1g in daltons is 6.022*10^23Da. Meaning in 1g 4.015*10^18 antibodies are present. The recorded viral load from the patient’s sputum samples peaked at 1.34*10^11 virion copies per ml. So assuming they had 5L worth of virions, making them 6.7*10^14 virion copies, 1g is enough to allocate 5993 antibodies per virion. This seems like enough when considering the micrographs. And since the 1g is dispersed within 5L its osmotic pressure reduces to 0.0012 mm Hg. Which is pretty much negligible because the plasma colloidal pressure within each capillary is estimated at 25mm Hg. This is why I settled on one gram. 

2 0.5g of antibodies against IL6

This is to deal with the cytokine storm of IL6 that the virus stimulates. The mass is based off of the idea that assuming half of all the virions produced stimulated production of IL6, there would be enough antibodies to coat 5993 copies. 

3 0.5g of antibodies against IL12. 

I read a compelling argument that IL12 is responsible for the leaking of fluid into the alveolar space. The idea is that differentiated helper T cells are responsible for secreting pro inflammatory chemokines which affect the permeability of the alveolar walls allowing fluid containing immune cells to flow into the alveolar space. So this adaptive immune response seems to be headed by TH1 cells. And I had read somewhere else that TH1 cell differentiation cannot occur in the absence of IL12. So preventing IL12 from functioning could help prevent this leaking into the alveoli. The mass is based on the same concept explained above(for IL6 antibodies). 



The means of attenuating the virus:

I speculate that passing isolated virions through restricted Phosphatase enzyme would break down the envelope of the virus and separate the spike proteins from the viral RNA. The idea is that the inner and outer layers of the envelope have hydrophilic phosphate heads which create a balance of inward and outward pulls. So if we cleave the outer phosphate heads and leave a lower charge hydroxyl group the imbalance of forces would lead to the envelope collapsing inward and possibly breaking apart. 
The virions can be isolated using plasma membrane filtration. 

Use:
This can be used to develop a vaccine. It could also be used to produce antibodies through the hybridoma method which could allow for mass production. 


So that’s basically my research. Hopefully it’s helpful. Stay safe.",8,2020-05-26 09:30:21,0,0,0,0,0

In the last couple of weeks I started my Python tutorial series called ""Space Science with Python"". The articles are, well, space related and explain how to determine certain properties of comets, how to compute coordinates of cosmic bodies or what kind of libraries and methods are available to calculate the trajectory of a spacecraft.

During my academia time, I worked on two major missions: The Rosetta/Philae mission and the Cassini/Huygens mission. Besides writing my thesis, publications and conference papers, I really liked to give public outreach presentations and speeches. People are so fascinated by space and are really thankful for talks that cover less common topics (niche topics, like moons in the Saturnian system, or the science behind meteor streams).

I would like to continue my public outreach passion and I was thinking to create my own Medium publication site where I will briefly explain recent science papers, general topics about the Solar System or showing open source software and toolkits that allow one to explore the cosmos virtually.

I always thought Nature was a a source that valued this intensely. Recently I’ve read articles with statements like “since there is a clear consensus that man induced global warming is real” and then today “(Nature recognizes that sex and gender are not binary...”. Now I am by no means a climate denier, but because of my undergrad so far I am simply not totally convinced or certain there is a true consensus, I simply am not sure we are truly positive this is a consensus like the mass of the elementary charge, etc. Don’t even get me started on the sex not being binary; gender I don’t even quite understand the true definition so I can’t speak to that, but biological sex??? Seeing one of the most reputable journals make such statements really terrifies me for where information and human knowledge could be quickly headed. It really feels like even the ‘truly scientific’ sources are now catering to an increasingly loud political group (far left if you will). Again I literally do not care at all for any politics, and am very left leaning myself overall; I also want us to be a green energy society just because it makes so much more sense in the long run regardless if we are right/wrong about climate change causation, etc. I really don’t care about that stuff, but I do care about information, and it’s integrity.

g7v8d7,"A shower musing that I'd like nothing more than for somebody to tell me is absolute nonsense, regarding dark matter/ energy.","The typical layman's introduction to any ridiculously uninformed concept: ""What if....""

What if gravity is an extra-dimensional gel that we exist within without realizing it, much like a fish in a tank unaware of the water. This 'gel' surrounds us., we swim through it, and yet it exists in some extra-dimensional plane where it can occupy the same space more than once at a time, causing an increased concentration where mass exists in our world. 

This gel like substance has gradients, not dissimilar to those imagined in the space-time graphs we're familiar with, and where mass is concentrated in our 3 dimensions the gel likewise is concentrated causing us to slide down toward the mass, hence the pull. 

This gel, not unlike water, can be changed in form from liquid, solid, and gaseous. Though instead of temperature changes causing the change, the process is driven by mass. 

This 3 state gravitational gel, then, can be fractured into different states based on the concentration of mass in a given location. Therefore when an extremely high level of mass is congregated in one location, such as in a black hole, the gel is fractured into an ice like state causing dark matter, which attributes for the discrepancy in calculating the gravitational effects witnessed in distant galaxies that we can't attribute to mass alone. Dark matter is not able to be perceived as it does not exist in our dimensions, much like the gel, and we simply witness the effects of it. 

Likewise cosmic explosions and other such displacement events cause the gel to be vaporized, once more increasing (beyond the expected calculation of mass alone) the expansion of the surrounding matter, causing dark energy. We can see that things are being pushed apart more than they should, but once more cannot tangibly interact with it or see how or why.

Now that I'm actually using C++ to do molecular simulations, and all the other fancy-pants computational physics stuff, I can't help but wonder I have never used a single class directly when I'm writing code.

I understand that it has to do with the fact that I'm not writing code for a user to use but just for myself, and for my own purposes, but I'd love to know what others think about this.

So can taking niacin help? since it is a major component of NAD and NADP, two coenzymes involved in cellular metabolism.
Niacin also (flush kind) has the ability to dilate the capillaries, surrounding the fatty tissues. When these capillaries are dilated, they can reach the fatty tissue and possibly flush out the toxins which are stored in the fat cells.

Niacin also improves kidneys and liver which are important for cleansing the body.

It says Niacin improves experimentally induced ulcerative colitis in mice and humans through the activation of PGD2/DP1 axis. what are PGD2 and DP1 and how do they help in this scenario? And anything else?
Also it says Niacin has a short half-life of 20 to 45 minutes. This is the time it takes for your body to reduce plasma drug levels by half. It takes approximately 5.5 x elimination half- life for a drug to be eliminated from your system. What do they mean by 5.5 x half life when they said it has half life of only 20 mins?

It is hanged on a wall using screws at the top of the cupboard. I am trying to understand what force must a screw withstand to keep the cupboard on the wall.

To keep it simple I started by trying to understand what horizontal force would be applied to a single screw by an ""L"" bracket. Here it is explained so I was able to calculate it ([https://youtu.be/kkgj5QBF\_Tc](https://youtu.be/kkgj5QBF_Tc)).

My example:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bkdf0jczsvz41.png?width=394&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58581c200600207609b0e33de6bb00afb2cb43f7

On a simple diagram above, imagine the pink coloured part is an L bracket and there is a Load1 placed at the top. The screw (considering only 1 screw to keep it simple) is also at the edge of the L bracket. Then I calculated the force F which a screw must withstand to hold the bracket, when Load1 = 40kg (392N) is:

F = (392N) x (39cm) / (80cm)

F = 191 N

So this would mean the screw must hold 191N .

If this calculation is correct (based on the yotube video where it is explained), then I got it. But then the question is, how would I calculate the force F on the screw if I add another 2 shelves on the L bracket above (green ones) and put also some Load2 and Load3 on it. This is not clear to me. Would the equation above also work with a condition I will sum Load1+Load2+Load3 there?",0,2020-05-20 03:44:39,2,2,2,2,2

I surely won’t start in a Calculus class this semester, unless my advisor decides to throw me in. I feel like I’m just setting myself so far behind the rest of the students. I understand the chemistry very well, but I almost feel like changing majors because I feel like the math will just be too difficult for me when I’m starting so far behind. 

Any help/stories/advice would be appreciated from all parties (and I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub).",11,2020-06-23 19:20:31,2,1,1,1,1

hyr3ku,"Reaction rates, the math is easy, but what if it says that you can get more reactions than you have incident particles?","[not a homework question]      
Probably, one of the most simple formula in Physics: reaction rate (s-1.cm-3) = Ф.σ.N , with Ф: neutron flux (neutrons.cm-2.s-1); σ microscopic cross section (cm2); N  atomic number density (atoms.cm-3).    


Say you have a flux Ф = 1000 neutron.cm-2.s-1.    
What is the B10(n,a) reaction rate of a 1 cm3 piece of Boron in such flux?   
σ: [3837b](https://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/cgi-bin/Tab80WWW.cgi?lib=J40&amp;iso=B010) = 3.84E-21 [cm-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_(unit)#Commonly_used_prefixed_versions)      
N: [2.46g.cm-3](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=boron), 19.8% of which are B10, that's [2.2E22 atoms.cm-3](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=atoms+in+%282.46*0.198%29g+of+B-10).    

reaction rate (s-1.cm-3) = 1E3 x  3.84E-21 x 2.2E22 = 8.45E4 s-1.cm-3    

... so each of the 1000 incident neutrons get captured 84 times ??    

How can you score 84 bulls eyes with only one  dart ?     


same for U235(n,f) ([585b](https://wwwndc.jaea.go.jp/cgi-bin/Tab80WWW.cgi?lib=J40&amp;iso=U235)) of 5% enriched metal Uranium ([19.05g.cm-3](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=uranium)): [2.44E21](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=atoms+in+%280.05*19.05%29g+of+U-235) x 5.85E-22= 1.43.

I'm a second year mathematics undergraduate student (in Australia) who wants to do biophysics research. I've recently started volunteer work in a computational neuroscience lab at my university (focussed on insect vision) which is teaching me MATLAB; some signal processing mainly.

I'm in the process of choosing electives for my second semester which will obviously impact my selections for next year as well. I'd like some advice as to which route to go, out of the following options:

Option 1 (Physics):  
Physics fundamentals 1  
Physics fundamentals 2  
Intro quantum physics  
Classical physics  
Electromagnetism

Option 2 (Chemistry):  
Chemistry fundamentals 1  
Chemistry fundamentals 2  
Intro organic chemistry  
Spectroscopy and data analysis  
Applied spectroscopy and electrochemistry  
Advanced organic chemistry

Option 3 (CS/Stats):  
Probability  
Stochastic processes  
Intro C++  
Machine learning  
CS theory  
Computer mathematics

Any advice will be appreciated. I would have loved to take more physics as well but unfortunately if I were my undergraduate degree would take an extra year and a half which seems unworthy? Thanks.",1,2020-06-16 05:14:19,2,2,1,2,0

My teacher at the time, recognizing that this was directed at her for assigning a piece of grammar homework AND a piece of reading homework AND a writing assignment all at once, was understandably frustrated that a 12 year old was challenging her. She tried to talk me out of it, but I was determined. (I got an A on that paper bc it was the one hw assignment I ever got in that class that I was passionate about)

Fast forward to today: just finished my first year as a high school physics teacher, and received the highest grade possible on my end of year evaluation from my division head. Students admin thought wouldn’t do well in my class performed exceptionally. Other teachers have asked how I manage to get such good work from such low performing students. The answer? 

I don’t assign homework.

fj83dr,Discussion,"Hi guys, I'm a Biomedical Scientist (microbiology) and my knowledge in cell biology is lacking.

I need someones input about Extracellular vesicles (EV).  Can the membrane be modified to introduce specific receptors? is it possible to produce vesicles on demand and what are the life duration?

Basically I have a dug development idea but I lack contacts to reach the relevent companies or RD sections of universities.

The drug idea is mainly dealing with viral infections. For this case the target virus is SARS cov-2 (covid 19)

1. creating a (EV) that has ACE2 receptors or receptor complex used by the target virus for cell entry. 
2. package inside the EV restriction enzymes or endonuclease specific for the virus such as APOBEC3
3. deliver the drug via nebulation

Hypothesis:

the virus will bind to the EV thinking its a cell, begin endocytosis. Once inside the EV, the virus would unpackage its contents in which the enzymes would cleave the viral genome.

We can deliver several thousands of EV to the target site. With other drugs that has shown some activity to SARS cov-19, it can be used as combination therapy.

Immune response to the EV would be low as the ACE2 is human in origin. The survivability of the EV while in the host has to be studied.

This would hopefully lower the viral load allowing host immunity to develope a immune response to fight the infection. This drug would only add time.",3,2020-03-15 15:37:49,0,0,0,0,0

So my problem is that my metabolism is (I think) too high, but I'm not sure if it's true or what I should do about it.","As the title says I (16, male, 55kg, 185cm/6'1) have a very high metabolism and no matter how much and which food I eat I can't gain weight from fat and I can also not build any muscle although I fulfil all the required things to build them (train, get enough protein through my foods, get lots of water and only exercise every second day to let my muscles rebuild). Now every time I work out I can see that my muscles can lift more and have more stamina, but they won't grow physically.

Now as you can see my problem is that I can not build muscle and I think the reason is that my metabolism is very high. I do not know much about what I should do, which is why I'm asking and I can't ask my doctor because he's working hard of course. 

So what should I do? Should I try to lower my metabolism for a while to be able to build muscle, how do I lower it and for how long? Should I wait till I get older to try and build muscle? Should I just keep doing what I'm doing and my body will start building muscle? As I said I can only see muscle performance growing, not the muscles growing in person, so should I just wait till my muscles reach their top performance in their current size before they will grow physically?

gw2amz,Pharmaceutical sales entry-level jobs,"Hi guys,

I'm one of those Biology majors that currently feels lost. I attended college and have just graduated recently with a BS in Biology. Honestly, I applied to colleges deciding to pursue biology because I enjoyed science in high school. Med school did run through my mind early on, but ultimately I decided that I didn't want to go that way. I managed to get a GPA decently above 3, but not anything I would brag about.

Anyway, I've been looking at posts and online forums (like on Reddit) about what to do with a Biology degree. Pharmaceutical sales, QA, etc. have been some options I've seen in order to get into the business side of these corporations, which I was intrigued by. I recently submitted a couple applications and just heard from one company, for the position titled ""Pharmaceutical Sales Rep – Entry Level and Experienced"". Now, of course I read its description and was applying to the Entry Level portion of the application. However, when they responded saying they were beginning an interview process and want to know what would work for me, they stated that I need ""Pharmaceutical sales training"" and ""some sales experience/abilities"". I've never worked in sales, let alone pharmaceutical sales or industries, only some small and part-time customer service jobs. I guess while I've seen that there are some pharmaceutical sales courses online for training, I assumed this would be part of the job if I got hired to the Entry level position. Is there anyone in pharmaceutical sales that can share their journey to getting their position/attest to if this? Is sales experience a necessity? Do I need to either find a company that will hire someone with no experience, or get the training online?

Furthermore, if you guys have any other suggestions or advice for someone in my position I'd greatly appreciate it. I understand the Biology degree is oversaturated and grad-school is an option and ideal in many circumstances, but as of now I am not interested in going that way.

Well, what if there's something there like an ""anti-photon"" or something like that because that space without light can't be empty so what if those ""anti-photons"" create darkness and they are ""weaker"" that normal photons and if they collide the normal photons win.
If those ""anti-photons"" exist the speed of light will be slower that the speed of darkness because if you produce a shadow on the moon (almost impossible to do) it will travel in a matter of second all the moon (by all I mean the side that the shadow is projected on to)

ibvbkk,"If Cancer is Caused by the Increasing Entropy, Therapeutics That Don't Consume Energy Can Never Fully Cure Cancer","Cancer can be thought of as a disease caused by an inevitable increase in entropy. If our cells are seen as ordered esicles of information, matter, and energy, inevitable disturbances in any one of these systems due to environmental factors or errors in regulation can increase disorder within the cell. The accumulation of these disturbances (i.e. mutations, mitochondrial toxicity, microenvironmental changes) increase disorder within the tissue and create malignancies that form cancer. 

The only way to curb the 2nd law of thermodynamics is to input energy into a system. Entropy can be maintained or reduced by inputing energy into a system. Cancer is a disease caused by an increase in entropy. So a cure to cancer would require using a therapeutic that consumes energy. Small molecules and static biologics do not consume energy. However, living therapeutics like CAR-T cells or gene-circuit based biotherapeutics like the ones being developed by Senti Biosciences do require energy and thus, from a physics standpoint, would seem viable as potential cures to cancer.

hkhu5a,Vitamin C(ascorbic Acid) made from herbs,"I was told to use a product called Him C-herbal vitamin c for my animals

The composition written on the product is below:

Him-C contains bioflavonoids like kaemprerol-3-0-B-D-glucoside and quercetin-3-0-BD-glucoside, which ensures better absorption of the supplement in the body

Herbal vitamin C: Him-C is a rich source of herbal vitamin C. Him-C contains bioflavonoids like kaemprerol-3-0-B-D-glucoside and quercetin-3-0-BD-glucoside, which ensures better absorption of the supplement in the body. Him-C also contains gallic and ellagic acids that have potent antioxidant properties, helping scavenge free radicals and reducing stress of varied etiologies


I searched on Google for the meaning/explanation of the terms in the description and I was led to CHEBI website and a book named ""Handbook of herbs and spices"".

In Chebi website it's mentioned kaemprerol  is called 
Astragalin and quercetin is called Isoquercetin, isoquercitrin or isotrifoliin.

In the book of ""handbook of herbs and spices"" the terms are mentioned couple of times.

All the above terms and explanation mentioned in the book or Chebi website are beyond my knowledge.

\- Highlight of recent physics news/student research: latest on frontier physics research. Highlight of the research being done at undegrad.

\- Events/workshops going on: a list of events/workshops relevant to undergraduates in the following month.

\- Problem section: a newsletter isn't complete without some entertainment. Problems in 4 categories: Mechanics, E&amp;M, Quantum, Comp'al physics. After the first issue, it would contain a list of the ""winners"" or the previous issue. You'd win by being the first to give a correct solution. 

INPUT DESIRED: Here are some questions:

1. General comments about the format; news, events, problem section. Good enough?
2. Is there some type of content that that you don't currently see, but you'd like to see in newsletters?
3. Frequency of newsletter: is monthly a decent frequency?
4. General feedback.

""The force, **F**, is resisted by the static friction at the point of contact of the wheel and the ground or other surface. This resistance causes the wheel to roll forward.""

But I don't have a good intuition for why this causes the wheel to roll forward. It seems like at the pivot point, the forces are balanced (friction from ground and tire spoke ""hitting"" the ground) and so the wheel shouldn't move yet there is a torque applied to the wheel so the wheel ""has"" to move which where I am confused.

I found this weeeird chunk of white stuff. It's almost feels like it's chunks of kitty litter. Is this a magical chemistry reaction where calcium carbonate is precipating and binding together? Is a mysterious animal opening the lid, using the sand, and then closing the lid? Is it ants?

helmgy,"I have question about calculation of results with complex measurement uncertainties, from multiple measurments.","So to put things simple, when we calculate a complex measurement uncertaintie and result, from few results of direct measurements(like in example below), should we first calculate average measurement results and then calculate the end result with this data(columns and then a verse), or should we first calculate end resoults and then averaged them(verses and then the end column)? Which method is more correct and why?

quick note about the example: small śr means average and I calculated in both ways I was firs verses and then column, and II was the other one.

[Example](https://preview.redd.it/jv9p88ampp651.jpg?width=4032&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=787344ae056c7130842592f2b969060f338146e3)

[picture link to imigur](https://imgur.com/a/01qpWuw)

I think that the method with columns first and then the verse is more accurate, because calculating end resoult for each measurment may cause more extreme values since the formula contains square powers. What do you think?

Prior to the pandemic I was able to buy a gallon jug of bio flame (part number 14-414) very easily at my hardware store. According to the MSDS it's 95% ethanol 5% water, I tried multiple hardware stores, online, even called the chemical manufacturer who makes it in the city and found nothing. I can buy ethanol or ethanol branded as fireplace fuel online but due to it being hazardous I can't get it shipped, or the cost is astronomical.

So I was wondering either A) if I can make ethanol easily and safely or B) if I can use isopropyl instead.

I use the fireplace outdoors on my patio, and actually tested 99% iso in the fireplace and it burned similar, but it burned hotter and with a bigger flame. I think its because it's 99% vs 95% but it also left some soot where as the ethanol didn't

grsgv5,Questions about barometric pressure changes causing headaches and triggering migraines:,"
I’ve noticed that every single year when the weather starts to turn hot and humid at the beginning of summer, I always get these headaches. I think I’ve eliminated the possibility that it’s due to dehydration from sweating because I’m especially diligent about drinking lots of water throughout the day when it starts heating up. The pain is centered mostly around my sinuses, behind my eyes, and in the top of my head towards the front so it feels a lot like a sinus headache. I’ve looked for explanations online and found some sources saying that this could be due to changes in barometric pressure that occur with the rising temperature and humidity, and that the discomfort is caused by the difference in pressure of the outside air and the air inside the sinuses. 

So my question is, if it is due to a pressure difference, is there a way to equalize the pressure? Why does the pressure inside the sinuses take so much time to change with the air pressure outside of the body? 

I’ve tried taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen and they somewhat take the edge off the pain, but the pressure and discomfort persist. So I’m just curious what’s going on inside the sinuses that makes it hard to adjust to the pressure.",7,2020-05-27 16:12:16,0,0,0,0,0

I know that skylight polarisation is due to Rayleigh scattering in the sky. And from wikipedia : “While all scattered light is polarized to some extent, light is highly polarized at a scattering angle of 90° from the light source...The degree of polarization first increases with increasing distance from the sun, and then decreases away from the sun. Thus, the maximum degree of polarization occurs in a circular band 90° from the sun.” 
The particles in the atmosphere, at increasing distance from the sun and also at decreasing distance of the sun could scatter light at 90 degrees (apart from other angles) giving high polarised light. But why and how is the degree of polarisation maximum only in the circular band 90 degrees from the sun?",3,2020-02-17 01:42:51,2,2,2,2,2

fd9ugb,Placing cells in water. What happens?,"a) An animal cell is placed in distilled water. What happens to the cell and why?

&gt;An explosion occurs as a result of the combination of water in the cell. Equalization of ion, atom/molecule in / and outside the cell concentration will occur as a result of water inflow; the process is called osmosis. There are no ions in distilled water; this leads to an explosion in the animal cell with respect to the inflow of water as there are dissolved ions (aq) and uncharged molecules in a living cell.

b) You put a plant cell in seawater. What happens to the cell and why?

&gt;According to osmosis, the plant cell may die if you place the cell in seawater with a high concentration of salt, then the cell plasma has a greater content of water than its surroundings, which means that water goes out and the cell shrinks and dries.

hbcsxm,My philosophy teacher argues that physical constants are based on faith as we only have past experiences as proof for them. What do you think about this?,"To elaborate a bit, she argues that anything that cannot be directly proven is thought to be true through assumptions based on prior experiences- basically by the method of induction. She states that an appeal to science doesn't work as the fundamental constants of the universe are assumptions we have created after analyzing multiple past experiments, and that there is no proof to the claim that the future will continue behaving like the past.

I’ll start off by saying that I have no background in physics, I’ve had a physics class for a year and then dropped it. 

But after I dropped it I somehow got into a discussion with someone who did take the class about the planck length. He said that it’s the smallest length possible and that there’s nothing that can be smaller. So I said that you could take half a planck length or even 1/100 of a planck length for that matter and it would be smaller. He disagreed and told me that that’s impossible, a physics teacher walked by and I asked him to back me up but he agreed with my friend. I told him that literally everything can be divided by two infinitely but he disagreed.

I searched online for a bit but I couldn’t find anything about lengths that are smaller than the planck length. But I was hoping that anyone here could tell me whether I was right, because I was and still am convinced that my point was valid.

However, if there is an academic type tool I coud use just to learn some of the more basic concepts involving phyiscs I would be very happy to try that out.

I recently discovered my fascination with physics by listening/watching various podcasts and videos of famous physicists talk about their field. Two of my favorite physicists to listen to are Brian Cox and Sean Caroll. While their deeper and more advanced topics are what originally peaked my interest in learning more about physics, I would like to go all the way back to the very basics so I can better understand the theories and apply formulas to specific questions.

One of the things that fascinated me the most about physics, is how much it pertains to other fields of science since it is quite literally all about figuring out more about the universe we inhabit. Because of that, most of the physicists I've listened to are decently well versed in other areas of science, which is something I admire a lot.

I never had a very strong background in science or mathematics, so something that would be willing to ease me into it would be preferred. Despite my lack of expertise in those subjects, it continues to captivate me and inspires me to learn more about it on my own.

I guess I can't suppose the calory needed to burn something is the calory of the thing right? I would be looking for the activation energy needed (ignition) ?

But I can suppose total and immediate combustion. Under that hypothesis, could I conclude the calories are equal?

I'd save power on my AC as well as on my water heater, although I don't expect it'd by much but still.

I've found that 1L of water that increases 1°C absorbs 4180J of energy. What I'd like to know is if that 1°C increase comes from the ambient air, by how many degrees can I hope to cool 1m³ of that air ? (of course given that the ambient air is considerably warmer than tap water).

I don't know why, but I've been feeling pretty bad about killing bugs lately. When they are in the house, I feel like I have to kill them, because I live with my parents and I need to keep the house clean. I can't always let them outside either. This winter, we had a ton of stinkbugs in our house, and they are an invasive species so its better that I kill them. But they are so docile I feel bad about it. Just now, I found a big spider in the basement (a wolf spider, I think?) and I went and smashed with a wad of toilet paper. It didn't even move when I got close to it. I know it's an instinctual thing for a creatures to freeze up to not be seen, but I felt bad that it didn't even put up a fight. And then I flushed it down the toilet, and I feel like it's so disrespectful to flush bugs down the toilet because sometimes they are still alive. Anyway, I then got mad at my myself because it could of killed other bugs down in the basement. My parents never come down to the basement anyway, I could let it live and mind its own business, but I had to go and kill it. I looked over at the spot where I found and had the tingling feeling of guilt and sadness. Like it could be over there right now living its life if I hadn't killed it.

The problem is knowing how to reverse a gravity field. We know gravity can bend light (in a black hole), so why can't gravity also exceed the speed of light?

It's a hocus pocus theory, but I really think gravity is somehow involved. In the dream, we had a glimpse of a far away planet similar to earth, by using these ""attractor gates"" to send a probe. Then we found a way to get there.

glmc00,Weird hard crystals deposited on inside dome of kamodo style grill. What could it be?,"Hey chemists!

I have a kamodo style grill that I used to use quite a bit and sometimes at pretty high temperatures (maybe 600°C to 700°C air temperature at the thermometer) by blowing air into the air intake.  Hot enough to warp and crack the cast iron grate that keeps the coals in the fire box.  Anyway, today I'm taking it apart to clean it, and I've found that there is this pretty thin \~.5mm layer of carbon with what appear to be some tiny crystals - too small to see but reflective. 

What could these crystals be?  I was thinking some silica made it in with some charcoal and maybe evaporated then condensed on the dome and mixed in with some of the carbon.  What might work for getting them off safely?  Any thoughts?",4,2020-05-17 15:08:00,1,1,1,1,1

fgn6b9,Teaching Biology,"Hello,

I will be graduating this Spring with my bachelors degree in Biology and I am feeling pretty lost. All my life I've wanted to go into the medical field. I've always had a passion for medicine and I love all that has to do with healthcare, so for most of my life I've wanted to become a doctor. Probably midway into undergrad I really started to discover that being a doctor isn't the only job in medicine, and I fell in love with an allied health career. It's a two year program and much cheaper than going to medical school and it pays very well. The thing is, it's such a tiny field that is so, so competitive that I'm becoming discouraged. I've applied, but all I've gotten are denials. I lack healthcare experience and this is a big one that adcoms are looking for, so I keep applying and applying to whatever jobs I'm qualified for at local hospitals/clinics in my area but so far, nothing. I'm starting to get really, REALLY discouraged. I've been volunteering at a hospital for a few months but I'm not finding it rewarding or relevant to be honest (all I do is restock gloves, no patient interactions. I don't even see the doctors because it's a small unit. I don't feel like I'm learning at all or like this is going to help me and I'm looking at leaving this position and finding something else soon). 

Anyways, while searching online for ideas of what I can do with my degree when I graduate (aside from typical research assistant jig), someone brought up teaching. This isn't something I have ever considered, but looking into it, it might not be too bad of an idea. I like the idea of teaching a subject that I love to kids, and I have some experience with children in the form of volunteering at summer camps and whatnot throughout high school and early college. I enjoy being around kids, but another thing I think about is what other will think. I know it shouldn't matter, but since I was a kid my whole family has known that I wanted to go into medicine, so everyone expects me to. I know my parents will support whatever I chose to do, but they will bring up the fact that this has nothing to do with what I really want and have always wanted to do. I don't know if teaching is something I would do for the rest of my life, and I don't know if having being a science teacher on my resume will help me get into the healthcare field that I really want to try and get into in a few years, but it is something I can see myself doing for a little bit.

I guess my intention with this post is just to get some opinions and advice from others who have been in my position. I have been feeling pretty crappy lately wondering what I'll end up doing with my life.",4,2020-03-10 18:16:13,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, I'm currently unable to walk (almost bedridden) and have ehlers-danlos, which is a degenerative disease. Hopefully, Im able to walk again but I want to be prepared in the case that I have to work from home. 

I currently am a research assistant in a neurology lab with a BS in genetics and a minor in microbiology. During college, I was a teaching assistant for three labs and a database curator. I plan to go back for a PhD or masters but am now wondering in what. Previously, I wanted to focus on microbiology and infectious disease, working on the genes in hosts that affect mircobial adherence and infectivity. 

Now, what PhD or masters program should I go for? I'm thinking bioinformatics as I have experience. What are some remote positions that I could do? 

It's heart breaking that I might never be in the lab again; as long as I have something with either genetics, micro, immunology, or virology, I'll be fine. Thanks",1,2020-05-18 13:47:58,0,0,0,0,0

hh62d3,How do we know that saving certain endangered species is the right thing to do?,"First off, I have only a bit more knowledge on conservation biology compared to the common person (senior undergrad biochem major), so these are genuine questions, not trying “stump” people. Also, I just want to say I am 100% an advocate for species and climate conservation and in no way skeptical of human beings having direct and detrimental impacts on the biosphere in general. Anyways...

How do scientists even understand whether or not a species is undergoing a natural extinction, rather than the typically cited case that it’s from human involvement? 
One thought I had for this would be species undergoing rapid and unusually large loss of population over a relatively short amount of time would be a good sign that humans are involved. However, even then how could you determine whether or not a sudden extinction of a species is a direct result of human interaction? I can imagine quick extinction of species has happened many times before modern humans appeared on earth.

This also leads to my next thought: I imagine it can be very easy to make conclusions to any type of species extinction event as that of human involvement. How do scientists know when to rule out human involvement, when we seemingly interact with every aspect of the environment and all life on earth one way or another? Every single time I’ve read the result of an extinction or endangerment of a species being from human involvement, I never even have a second thought or skepticism of these claims, which is bad basic science as EVERYTHING should be questioned. 

Overall, how could we know saving an endangered species is actually bad for the balance of its respective ecology?

What do I need to do?","Our toilet had one of those blue cleaner things that you stick in the back of the tank on it, so the water was blue, but I wanted to get the mold out so I squirted a Clorox bleach spray into the toilet as well. I pretty quickly remembered that I shouldn’t mix bleach with other chemicals but didn’t immediately realize how serious it was to not. I flushed the toilet a few times and wiped the bowl with the rag, and I’m not sure if it was mixed in the bowl or mixed by my scrubbing, but multiple times over the course of 3-4 hours I had to leave the bathroom for a minute or so at a time to stand by the window for fresh air. I would be okay for 20 minutes at a time or so, then would have really intense burning and itching in my throat and eyes and nose. I was coughing and sneezing and my eyes were watering too bad to even open, but after getting fresh air and recovering I continued to ignore my bodies warning signs and kept going into the closed bathroom with the irritating chemicals. I probably had to leave for fresh air about 5 times in 3 hours until eventually it started burning so badly that I couldn’t be in at all anymore. I stopped cleaning the bathroom before I was finished because I could not handle it anymore. 

When I left the bathroom I was coughing, sneezing, runny nose and eyes, eyes burning too bad to open, wheezing and chest pain. I opened all the windows and stood by one for a few minutes to get some air.

The stuffiness is barely noticeable now, but the chest pain and tightness doesn’t seem to be letting up. This could be the anxiety I’ve given myself though, haha. I am not coughing as bad but am concerned by the chest pain and the fact that I sat in there exposed for so long. 

Is there any possibility of harm being done to my health from this? Is there anything I need to do? How long do I need to keep my windows open?

For the uninitiated, consider this. A large cylinder spins in space, so that it's circumference is close to the speed of light. According to Special Relativity, the circumference should contract. And yet, the radius is perpendicular to the movement, and so should contract. How does that even look,? Does pi move? How can it possibly work?

If this is a dumb question, forgive me. I am working my way though the Feynman Lectures to get an initial overview of physics and that is where my experience ends so far, though I am very interested in it.",4,2020-05-06 04:37:51,2,2,2,2,2

hwxq7m,Are blood vessels (and lymph vessels for that matter) organs or tissue?,"So what I've learnt in school is that organs are things made up of more than one type of tissue. I have asked my teacher before, once a few years back and once just recently, and her answer has changed (initially she said it was an organ, but when i asked her the other day she said tissue). Don't get me wrong she's a great teacher, but we do all make mistakes don't we.

Google yielded no direct answer and in my research I remembered that veins and arteries have a structure similar to the oesophagus with 2 types of muscle, and im assuming an epithelium layer. However capillaries are one cell thick, so how could they be organs? And ive never learnt the structure of lymph vessels so im clueless about those.

Does that make my question too vague? Is blood vessel too general of a term, and only arteries and veins are organs whereas capillaries are not? If so, where do venules and atrioles and shunt vessels stand? I personally think that blood vessels are organs nonetheless, but i just wanna confirm",16,2020-07-24 02:50:45,0,0,0,0,0

gify80,Switching from Biochem to bio?,"TL;DR at end since this is a rant question.

So I am a biochem major right now, if I take summer classes and take a lot of credits in the fall and spring I can graduate May 2021 (so total I've been in college 4 years, and would graduate yr 5). My friend noticed I have been struggling with classes and made a comment about how the classes will only get harder from here. In Fall 2020 I'm taking biochem, Achem, amd Pchem all at once and some electives so it'll be difficult. I am really passionate about biology, but chose biochem originally since I thought it would be a better job market and I could find a good paying, stable career. But I'm not passionate about chemistry like I am about biology, I love animals and would love to work with animals. I have an appointment with my advisor asking if it would be wise if I switch to biology. Would I be able to find a career that I could work with animals, is a stable job, and I could make enough money that going through college was worth it? I want a career I can thrive day to day instead of survive. I don't know what options are available to me though, if I do switch to just biology or something similar. I guess I'm asking what is your guy's experience with academia and finding a biology career. Maybe something like animal rehabilitation or conservation that I have to do field work in. I have a lot of lab experience and work in a lab (not getting hours since Covid, research is shutdown), so maybe that experience will be handy. Does anyone have any advice? I would greatly appreciate it.

f82voh,Burning and Suppression of Solids (BASS) on the International Space Station by NASA,"Source: [Physical Sciences Informatics (PSI)](https://maptis.ndc.nasa.gov/Athena/ViewRecords.aspx?pk=4&amp;rk=7280)

Experiment Introduction:

Combustion tests burning fabric sheets are conducted aboard the ISS (International Space 
Station) using the Microgravity Science Glovebox Facility.
 
The sheets are mounted in a holder
which sandwiches the fabric between two thin stainless-steel frames. The exposed fuel measures 8.5 cm in length and 1.2 or 2.2 cm in width. One short edge of the fuel is not framed, and ignition is achieved 
across the sample on this edge.

A 29-gage Kanthal wire spans the sample and is resistively heated to provide ignition. Typically the igniter resistance is 1 ohm and a current of around 3.7A is supplied for ignition, which occurs within about 2 s. The samples each have their own integral igniter, 
the leads of which are glued flat along the frame to minimize any flow disturbances. The igniter leads 
come off the back of the sample and go to a connector which is plugged in during installation. 

The custom-made fabric (sometimes referred to as SIBAL fabric) is a blend of cotton and 
fiberglass. The threads consist of fibers of cotton and fiberglass which are spun together. A simple 
weave patter is used with a spacing of 60 by 40 threads per inch (inset of Fig. 2). 

The overall area density is 18.0 mg/cm2, with 75% by mass cotton and remainder fiberglass. This fabric was developed with the idea that the fiberglass matrix would be left behind after all the fuel is consumed, so that the sheet would not curl or crack. Either of these geometrical changes could affect the flow significantly and so are undesirable. 

As will be seen later, the flame is very sensitive to small air flow changes in 
microgravity. The samples are burned in the SPICE apparatus which is a small flow duct with a cross-sectional area of 76mm x 76mm. The front window of the duct can be opened so that samples can be installed one at a time. There is a tab with alignment holes on the sample holder which permits
quick and accurate installation onto small rare-earth magnets inside the flow duct.

Samples can be flipped 180 degrees so that the igniter is on the upstream or downstream end of the fuel. In this way, both concurrent-flow and opposed-flow tests can be conducted. The electrical connector is plugged into a socket inside the duct and the wires are tucked into a corner to minimize flow disturbances. 

A variable-speed fan is used to generate air flow speeds from 0 to 40 cm/s. Air speed is the principal 
variable for this experiment.

The flow duct is housed within the Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG) which provides 
power, imaging, and a level of containment. It is very advantageous that the astronaut can perform 
hands-on operation of the experiment while viewing the flame directly. 

Sometimes the flame is very dim or has features which the camera misses. The astronaut can make observations in real-time to the research team on the ground which is in direct audio and visual communication. The researchers on the ground in turn provide guidance and clarification is being performed while at the same time benefitting 
enormously from the direct involvement of the ISS crew member. After all the appropriate electrical connections are made between the duct and the MSG, the cameras are set up. The cameras provide the bulk of the data for this experiment. 

A digital still camera takes high-resolution pictures through the top window at rate of about one frame per second. A video camera captures the edge view of the flame through the front window at 30 frames per second. There is a character overlay on the video image to display fan setting, flow speed (from a hot-wire anemometer), radiometer output from a wide-angle sensor inside the duct, and time.

After the sample is installed, the MSG volume is sealed and the lights are turned off. The experiment is operated using a control box which is external to the MSG and can adjust flow speed, igniter on/off, and radiometer gain. In addition to the camera views which are available live to both the astronaut and the ground team, the astronaut can look into a port to view the flame directly. Just before the test is initiated, the flow is set to the desired value and the cameras start 
recording. Ignition is turned on and a flame is established within about 2 seconds. The flame spreads across the sample, ultimately consuming all the fuel and then goes out. In some tests, the flow speed is 
changed while the flame is burning to gage its effect. After the flame goes out, the duct is allowed to 
cool and vent for several minutes until the old sample can be removed and a fresh one installed for the 
next test.

f5w417,PhD vs Opening a restaurant; What would you do,"Hi all. Here's an interesting conundrum for you all. Here's my back story. After getting expelled from uni my first time for poor grades, I buckled up and was readmitted when I was 22 ish for biomedical physics. This time I didn't mess about. I finished the degree, and continued on to the master's. I finished my [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) and all of my CAMPEP required courses (CAMPEP is to get accepted into a medical physics residency). Right away, I've moved into the PhD where I'm fortunate enough to work with a very prestigious PI who happens to be an MD/PhD at a massive cancer centre in canada. Everything is shaping out to be awesome right? not so much...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm about 3 months into the PhD now, and I'm starting to question my decision. My supervisor insists that we are present 9-5 everyday. With my stipend, I make about $10/hr (minimum wage is \~$14/hr) and live in Toronto. During the [M.Sc](https://M.Sc) I used to have time to do other stuff, tutor, go to the gym, sleep in, skip a day, etc so it made the low pay somewhat bearable. But now... I'm not sure...

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, I'm 28, engaged, and ready to move forward with next steps (kids etc) but I don't want to do it with slave wages and take on that kind of responsibility. During the last 6 or so years, I've also really mastered cooking. I don't want to toot my own horn, but I've heard from countless people that I should open a restaurant some day.  I've even made a menu. Of course opening a restaurant is no easy feat. I know it requires extremely hard work (perhaps even more than the PhD) but at least it's something that I could be proud of. Something I built from the ground up.  

&amp;#x200B;

After the PhD is finished, I would have to do a two years residency, then I could work as a medical physicist. That's still 6 years away. I'm not sure what to do. It's like... I've already come half way down this path, but is the right decision to keep going or to change paths. Anyways, what would you do? Should I give the PhD another 6 months or so to see if things improve? Some of my lab mates are hinting at me that if I bust my ass I might be able to finish before four years, as the lab has been actively publishing papers for years now.",10,2020-02-18 12:18:35,2,2,2,2,2

gwb7fw,Question about Clausias Method for mean free path.,"Hi, I am having some problem regarding the Clausias method for mean free path. Please have a look at these 2 images at first: https://m.imgur.com/a/wJmVygf. According to this theory, only one molecule is considered in motion in a cylinder while all others are in rest. the length of cylinder is l and radius is sigma. now it is calculated that total no of molecules in that cylinder is 
 nπ(sigma)²l (pls check the images) so the only  molecule in motion (suppose it is c) will have nπ(sigma)²l collisions. how is that possible? let's consider an example. there are n teams in a tournament and each team will play with each other only once. so each team will play total (n-1) matches right? for n teams, each team will have n-1 matches. same case applicable here. molecule c itself is included in the total nπ(sigma)²l molecules. so obviously it can't collide with itself(at least in this case). then the total no of collisions is supposed to be ""nπ(sigma)²l - 1"" instead of ""nπ(sigma)²l"" . hope that makes sense. i would really appreciate if someone can help me in this regard.",0,2020-06-04 00:39:44,2,2,1,2,2
fopwnb,Static electricity on the moon and why the Apollo 15 flag moved when the astronaut didn't touch it,"I have been doing a bit of research about the [moment captured on video](https://vimeo.com/2109735#t=159s) during the Apollo 15 moon landing when the astronaut David Scott bounced past a flag and the flag started to move. The cause of the movement is debated. A semi-official explanation on [Nasa's Apollo 15 lunar surface journal](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a15/a15.clsout2.html) is that Scott touched the flag with his elbow (see the entry at 148:57:15). The journal says that the idea he was carrying a static charge which caused the flag to move is ""very unlikely"" since there were no similar flag movements seen in other moon walks. However, I think Scott was too far from the flag to have touched it, as shown in [this video of a 3d recreation of the scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsYcOiyuVC4). According to that, Scott was about a metre from the flag. So I think the movement must have been caused by static electricity.

According to this [slideshow by a NASA scientist](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20160013625.pdf) (slides 7 and 8), static charges dissipate on the moon in microseconds, which would make it hard to see how Scott could have been carrying a charge when he passed the flag. The reason for the fast dissipation is the solar wind, which bombards the moon with electrons and protons and creates a ""plasma sheath"" of electrons around the moon. These ambient electrons act as a ground to any positive charge and dissipate it. Interestingly, though, a negative charge takes slightly longer to dissipate, because it is dissipated by the ions in the solar wind, which are less dense than the electrons in the moon's plasma sheath. I found an interesting paper, ""[Concerning the dissipation of electrically charged objects in the shadowed lunar polar regions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL034785)"", which gives a formula for the amount of time it takes for a static charge to dissipate on the moon. As an example they provide calculations for a position 85 degrees from the subsolar point (the point directly under the sun) -- near the ""terminator"" region (the terminator is the line between the day and nightsides of the moon). But I think the maths actually works anywhere on the dayside surface, for negative charges at least, since the density of incoming ions from the solar wind is the same everywhere on the dayside, at 5 per cubic centimetre.

The most interesting fact is that the time taken for the charge to dissipate is inversely proportional to the area that the charge covers. This is because the larger the area, the more ions will come into contact with the charged surface, and the quicker the charge will be dissipated. So if the charge is concentrated in a small area, it takes longer to dissipate. The example given in the paper is of an astronaut's spacesuit, with an area of 10 square metres. They say a negative charge would dissipate from a spacesuit in 0.003 seconds. But for an astronaut's boot, which is only 1m², the charge would take ten times longer (0.03 seconds) to dissipate. Using the formula given I calculated that a negative charge that covered only 80cm² would take 3.5 seconds to dissipate, which would have given Scott time to receive the charge off-camera and to move past the flag while still charged, making the flag move.

Using the [Quickfield](https://quickfield.com/free_soft.htm) electric field simulation software I set up a [3D scene](https://i.imgur.com/eOom8fl.png) where an astronaut is one metre from a flag, and set an 80cm² area on the astronaut's arm to be charged to -10,000 volts. [The result showed](https://i.imgur.com/KHDqZOk.png) that the presence of the charge on the astronaut produced a force of 0.000002 Newtons on a selected 9.3cm² area in the corner of the flag. I have not studied physics but using the procedure outlined [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-physics-1/ap-linear-momentum/introduction-to-linear-momentum-and-impulse-ap/v/force-vs-time-graphs) I tried to calculate the effect this force would have on the flag. Assume that the force was applied for 1 second, which is about the amount of time it took the astronaut to pass. 0.000002 Newtons for one second is an impulse of 0.000002 Newton-seconds. Since impulse/mass = final velocity - initial velocity, and since the initial velocity is zero, it's just necessary (I think) to divide this impulse by the mass of the small flag section to find the velocity in meters per second that the flag section would end up with.

[This flag](https://www.usflagstore.com/US_Flag_3x5_Embroidered_Nylon_p/60-100-3111.htm) is the same size as the one used on the moon (3' by 5') and according to the linked web page it weighs .55 lbs, which is 249 grams. In the moon's gravity 249 grams would be 41.17 grams. 9.3cm² is 0.00067 times smaller than the full flag, so reduce the weight by the same factor to find the weight of the piece of flag we are looking at. This works out as 0.028 grams, or 0.000028 kilograms. 0.000002Ns / 0.000028kg = 0.07 metres per second, or 7cm per second. So according to this, the 9.3cm² area of flag would have been moving at 7cm per second after the astronaut passed. This speed seems reasonable, however, I assume that the calculation is not totally accurate, since it would seem to give the velocity if the force was applied upwards, against the moon's gravity, rather than sideways. I don't know enough to take the direction of the force into account. Presumably it would take less force to move the flag sideways than to move it upwards, so the charge on the astronaut would not need to be as large as -10,000 volts to cause the movement seen. It would be great if anyone knows how much force would be needed to move the flag sideways.

As to how the astronaut received the charge, I assume he touched some object offscreen, perhaps a piece of metal equipment. The spacesuits were coated in Teflon, which is [very electronegative](https://www.alphalabinc.com/triboelectric-series/).",68,2020-03-25 08:03:28,2,2,2,2,2

gm86wq,"Master's in science in Molecular and Cellular Biology, OR, Human and Biomedical/Translational Biology","Hello everyone. 

I have been called to interview for the aforementioned programs at a really good German university, after having qualified the entrance exams for them. As i wait to be interviewed, i'm having trouble comparing these courses. My research interests lie in understanding the molecular basis, pathology and progression of cardiovascular disease and the interplay of immunity and diet and exercise. While i am quite keen on pursuing a PhD in life sciences, i do not want to rule out the possibility of working in the pharmaceutical/life science industry after graduating. I have a Bachelor's degree in pharmaceutical sciences too, which might come to good use here. 

Does anyone here have any experience working in German pharmaceutical industry, especially in the research and development departments, have any advice on what i should seek from a graduate degree in life science to be seen as a competitive applicant? 

To those currently pursuing PhDs in similar fields (or not), does it help to have a general master's degree in cell and molecular biology, or is it better to have a focus on an area that you're leaning in the direction of, but are not entirely sure about? Is it easy to make a switch? 

Please, please feel free to mention any questions that I should be asking but are missing here, and do chip in with any advice you might have for someone planning to start graduate school in the life sciences.

Bioabsorbable lactide/glycolide polymer excipients have helped, for over several decades, to facilitate the safety, efficacy and performance of complex parenteral drug products designed for extended release. Such functional polymeric excipients enable systemic or local delivery of peptides and small molecules for days, weeks and months. Preparations include microparticles, nanoparticles, implants, in situ forming implants and devices. More than 50 drug products utilizing these excipients are now on the market worldwide and further growth is anticipated. For formulation success, it is important to recognize and understand the key properties of tunable lactide/glycolide polymer excipients and how they interact with drug properties. This presentation will highlight key properties of lactide/glycolide excipients for drug delivery and demonstrate how to apply these excipient properties to achieve desired formulation performance while optimizing processes for the clinical and commercial manufacturing of the sterile drug product. Microencapsulation processes will be highlighted to show the importance of scale up considerations and use of advance processes such as continuous manufacturing. In summary, this presentation will show how the properties of lactide/glycolide excipients and drug substance along with product-by-process manufacturing define formulation matrix structure. This matrix structure that then defines drug delivery performance.

Crisper editing of course in the event my current genetic testing comes out positive. Obviously, with exosuits and stuff coming out, people like me will be able to walk more independently. There are also prospects of nanomedicine in the future possibly curing conditions like this. These are kinda fields I want to go in to advance treatments for me and a bunch of others. So yeah tell me your opinion on this and if these are viable, or any other future treatment that you guys think could help someone like me with a non-progressive myopathy.

hb62p4,International Postcode system using Cubic Meters - CubicPostcode.com,"Hello, I have some ideas to share about an international postcode system using cubic meters. Each postcode location would be quite small, that is, the size of a cubic meter. Each postcode location would be a cube in a grid of cubes with an edge of 21 million cubes. This would total 9,261,000,000,000,000,000,000 cubes. All cubes would be numbered, using 22 algarisms (21m\^3= 22 digits). 

The website is on github, you can visit going to: [CubicPostcode.com](https://CubicPostcode.com)

This would have many applications; particularly cool with augmented reality, semantic web and new ways of world mapping for propriety house register and real estate.

9,261,000,000,000,000,000,001 to 9,999,999,999,999,999,999 could be codes used for moving items, like telephone numbers, ISBNs, RFIDs or IP addresses. Everyone would get used to this string codes of 22 algarisms.

Looking for someone that could collaborate with me in the algorithm design and code implementation.

Work in progress with a little script in Python that converts cube number into XYZ cartesian coordinates, In case you might be interested we have also HTML5 / JS code to convert GPS &lt;-&gt; XYZ cartesian coordinates in meters. 

Here: [https://github.com/cubicpostcode/LLA\_ECEF\_Conversion](https://github.com/cubicpostcode/LLA_ECEF_Conversion)

&amp;#x200B;

In case you ask, I know about ""what3words"", sure, but it is a proprietary system. Also, the words get clunky and there are many languages that don't use the English alphabet making it much more clunky. Algarisms are much more widely used and better for a universal, compact and unambiguous system. Also, my proposed cubic postcode includes all places on Earth volumetrically, not just the surface and creates an interesting aesthetical appeal for monument architectonical creations.

&amp;#x200B;

Also if we used 22 algorisms strings for everything, including phone numbers, we would not need international prefixes in our phone numbers. We could use these 22 algarism strings for everything, including phone numbers without prefix, etc. as described in the cubicpostcode website.

&amp;#x200B;

What3words is interesting but slightly flawed. Being proprietary makes it more likely to be widely adopted as they can afford advertisement and infrastructure development. But still, I think this system is much better. Simple, compact, universal and elegant.

The only problem is that i have a lot of issues learning and concentrating because i have been diagnosed with ADHD and at a high level and i cant take meds anymore since they have been linked with mental issues i have had and now know they were because of them. And since physics, math, chemistry etc. are very precise subjects its very important to know the formulas and calculations accurately (as you probably all already know).

2)The most important and/or difficult topics from the course that I will use all the time in future(with regards to my journey as a theoretical physicist)

3)General suggestions, best books (review on the ones in pic or additional, I know about Jackson), best online lectures/courses on coursera,edX etc, material and sites to problem solve and practice

The gas is likely air, however I don’t want to make assumptions, which makes my job a lot harder.

However, there is one object which specifies a real world gas by name, and how it interacts with the surrounding atmosphere, more specifically how long the real world gas takes to dissipate in the atmosphere so they are no longer mixed. My question is, using the information I’m given on this real world gas and it’s interaction with the air, can I calculate the air’s density?",2,2020-06-03 12:32:11,2,2,2,2,1

so what do u think i should do? can i continue for an ms or phd in biomed sciences (such as genetics cancer or sth since i need a backup plan if i dont get into med school)

or should i just do biology pre med ?

i think that if i didn’t continue med school or grad school at least id secure a job in a hospital or should i not think like that? (if i majored in med lab sciences)

im clueless and i hope u’ll be able to help &lt;33 (also thanks if ur read the whole thing)",4,2020-07-16 07:21:23,0,0,0,0,0

But what confuses me is why the potential energy does not change along the length of conductor. If the negative terminal is high potential and the positive terminal is low potential, then it must require some amount of energy to push it from positive to negative.
And if voltage is equal to the energy required to push it that distance, but also equal to the field strength times distance, shouldn't it require half as much energy to push an electron half the length of the wire? Then as a result shouldn't the potential energy move linearly downwards as you move from the negative end to the positive end.

Maybe something I'm struggling with is to whether two parallel plates have a high potential (for an electron) at the negative end and a low potential at the positive end. [Like in two parallel plates.](http://imgur.com/gallery/T699sEr)",22,2020-07-15 07:14:15,2,2,2,2,2

hdr9jv,Rounding Significant Figures and the Rule of 5 - Why We Round 3.25 to 3.2 and not 3.3,"I created a video that I explains the rules of rounding significant figures. If you’ve ever been confused as to why we round 5.05 to 5.0 and not 5.1, or 3.25 to 3.2 and not 3.3 (if you were asked to round to the nearest tenth), I hope this video will clarify that!

https://youtu.be/oZFnJ-fIQfA 

Basically, when you round off, your change the value of the number you are rounding. According to the old rules everyone knows, you round “up” 5 times (5,6,7,8,9) and you round “down” only 4 times (1,2,3,4). If you have a large data set and you need to round the numbers, you will be rounding up 5/9 times and rounding down 4/9 times. This can skew the data and potentially misrepresent results!

So in chemistry, we follow three rules of rounding significant figures, which I explain in my video around 4:27. 

I spend the rest of the time doing practice problems. 

I hope this video clarifies a confusing concept!",8,2020-06-22 07:14:23,2,1,1,1,1

gfns0l,Why hasn't anyone cured nearsightedness yet?,"I think most nearsightedness is preventable and here is a purely anecdotal story to back up my claim. My parents are both immigrants to the United States from islands in the Caribbean. They had 20/20 vision until they got old. Now me and my sister, their only children, have awful nearsightedness and have to wear glasses all of the time. Additionally, I went to a youth group of about 20 teenagers who were also the children of immigrants, and like 80% of them had some sort of nearsightedness, while maybe two of their parents had nearsightedness. That's a giant jump.

Oh, and here's my case that nearsightedness is preventable. There is a study by Chinese researchers here: [https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2009/01000/Prevalence\_of\_Myopia\_in\_Urban\_and\_Rural\_Children.8.aspx](https://journals.lww.com/optvissci/Fulltext/2009/01000/Prevalence_of_Myopia_in_Urban_and_Rural_Children.8.aspx) 

and it basically says that urbanization is linked to nearsightedness, and it has nothing to do if the kids watch tv while to close to it or if they spend a lot of time reading. There are also a lot of other studies, even all the way back from 1988 that suggest similar things. The point I give you from this is that the correlation between myopia and bookishness may just be a confounding variable and city people may be more cultured from living in the city, and living in the city makes them nearsighted. 

Now, all the research points in this correlation between myopia and local industrialization, but the cause seems to be unknown. Is nearsightedness caused by city kids not having enough light? Is it caused by a vitamin A or D deficiency? Is it caused by not enough light? Is it caused by not enough outside light? Is it caused by not having to look far enough peripherally? Is it caused by pollution? Can we fortify our milk with good vision? The only option for a cure I see is some sort of animal testing since I think testing on children is more unethical, but what would be a good animal to use? Would mice suffice even though they may not have good vision ever? Can owls or cats get myopia in the first place?

I just feel like it's a shame that no one has come up with a cure yet, even though nearsightedness is an illness that affects so many people, how is it not thoroughly solved? I'd understand somewhat if it was a problem that only affects the poor and disenfranchised living in the middle of nowhere, but it actually affects many of the people who do research, and why haven't any of them considered researching why they need the glass directly in front of their eyes? Like, glasses are probably a billion-dollar industry, but if the causes behind nearsightedness could just be widely understood it would benefit a billion people.",6,2020-05-08 01:24:54,0,0,0,0,0
haei5v,On the impact of biology research,"Hey r/biology

I am a rising 4th year student in computer science and mathematics, who is aspiring to become a computer scientist and even though I have a scientific curiosity that need to be fed independently and understand the importance of basic research with no applications in mind and its influence on modern science and technology, I have been having some strong feelings and finding it a little hard to justify doing research that most likely won't have an impact on people's lives (in a good way, doing algorithms research for Facebook or increasing the performance of ML systems that are quite far removed from being applied in practice doesn't count for example)

After thinking about it for a while I realized how important it is for me to not only pursue my scientific curiosities but also have an impact on people's lives and come to realize that biology provides what is quite possibly one of the finest balances between these two, where I find myself quite interested whenever I read about new advances in biology, and there is no question that research in many areas of biology has quite possibly the greatest rate of direct implications on people's lives among all the sciences. I am aware that with all research comes the risk that you produce nothing of value, but the premise of a lot of the research in biology seems to me worth the risk . So my questions are:

1. Is my view of biology research naive? I understand that not all biology research has direct implications and there is a lot of research that is purely basic research, but I imagine that its easier for biology students to participate in research with high potential of making an impact on people's lives, no?
2. How impactful do you think your research is, and briefly what is it on?
3. How hard would it be for a computer science and math student having taken no course in biology (but willing to spend whatever time to learn, I am a quick self-learner) to do research in biology (by going to grad school in biology or other departments that will allow me to do biology research). Note that  I am aware of computational biology, but having gone over the problems the field deals with briefly it doesn't seem to catch my attention (remember I am trying to balance my scientific curiosity with impact, otherwise I would have went to med school :p) What about fields that are further away from CS and math like molecular biology, I have heard of people making such switches like Venki Ramakrishnan and Francis Crick (Physics to Structural biology) however physics to structural biology is much closer of a switch than CS and math to any non-comp bio field, also these were exceptional people..
4. How do you see advances in computer science affecting your field, biology in general, and medicine (I know this is not the best sub to ask about medicine, but while we are at it..)?

All in all I am finding it extremely hard to justify not working on scientific questions relating to elevating the human condition.

Any input would be appreciated.

I am a passionate lover of tea, and enjoy reading and learning about effects of different chemicals on human body, mind, etc.  And I was wondering what is the best way to extract the most L-Theanine from Camelllia sinensis, more specifically green tea. I was reading that Polyphenols and such can be extracted by Microwave assisted extraction, and with water extraction. 

Now as I am just a regular person, I have no fancy devices in my home, so I want to know what is the best way to extract those things by myself. I have also read in some research that they found most L-theanine can be extracted by soaking tea in 80°C for 30 minutes, where tea is from 0 mm to 5 mm big.

hh798c,EMT looking to pursue a BS in Bio with a serious lack of prerequisite knowledge.. Need realistic advice on outlook.,"I'm a 23 year old EMT and I recently decided that I want to go back to school to finish off my bachelors. I got an Associates degree in graphic design immediately after finishing high school but decided to pursue EMS instead. I'm considering a BS Degree due to this headstart on my General ED as opposed moving on to paramedic/fire academy as many EMT's do.

Biology interests me due to the relation to my EMT studies. I am just concerned because I feel immensely ill equipped even compared to most recent high school grads. To be quite frank I really just fucked around in high school and did the bare minimum to graduate (algebra 2 and intro to Bio). I've never taken chemistry, pre calc, calculus or even a real bio class for that matter. The extent of my high school academic accomplishments span about what most kids accomplish in their freshman/sophomore year.

With all that said, does this sound like a realistic goal to set out for myself? One of the main reasons I am looking into sciences is because everyone agrees arts are highly competitive, low paying and lacking in job outlook... but is Bio really any better when it comes to competition and job outlook at least?  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",7,2020-06-27 22:11:45,0,0,0,0,0

I’m performing an assignment where I have to interpret a study on carps about the oxidative stress that a certain sweetener induces in the cells. 
In order to not make false assumptions, I need your help. 

Superoxide dismutase, catalase and hydrogen peroxide content is being measured in the blood, liver, gills, brain and muscle. 

So, these biomarkers concentrations tend to increase more in gills, brain and muscle. Is one of the reasons for that the higher respiration rates of these particular tissues, against blood and liver?

I don’t really know in how many orders of magnitude these three surpass the blood and liver respiration rates, actually I just assume it (Muscle and Brain - ATP needs; Gills - they uptake the oxygen, so I think it is natural to also have an increased respiration rate or oxygen content)

What specific compounds would work? Dymethyl Benzyl Ammonium Chloride Dihydrate (the most common)? From what I can find it works on enveloped lipid containing viruses and works with other SARS related coronaviruses.

What dilution is it effective at?

I'm Thomas. I work with Python since a few years and my main topics are  related to data science / engineering, machine learning and astronomy.  My background is astrophysics and Solar System research. After a few  years studying and working in the scientific community I changed to the  automotive industry with financial related topics; however I still work  on science related topics in my free time.

I  the last couple of years I got some very specific, space science  related Python skills, after I worked for the Philae Lander (Rosetta  mission to the comet 67P) and on a cosmic dust measuring device mounted  on the Cassini spacecraft (mission to Saturn). I did... well... science.  E.g., I used machine learning algorithms to handle and analyse the  data. I did Monte-Carlo simulations (also with Python), public outreach  material, my doctorate studies and so on. To give you an overview, I am  the first author of a meteor camera analysis paper, where the analysis  and almost all plots have been done with Python:

[https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf](https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/125/2017/gi-6-125-2017.pdf)

[https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6445/eaat2349)

Anyway, why am I here? I would like to ask you, the community, if something like a ""Medium Article series"" or something similar would be interesting  for you to work on space related data and topics with Python?

I would like to share my knowledge and would like to show you for example:

* How to compute simple trajectories of spacecraft missions
* How to compute positions and orbits of asteroids, planets, etc.
* How  to determine the position of objects in the sky (+ brightness  computations, visibility on different geographic coordinates, etc.)
* How to ""answer"" space science related questions (so a series, where the content of a paper is being reproduced)
* Simple animations (like this attempt, I worked on a few years ago: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yoYZERieuQ))

Again: everything would be done in Python, and the corresponding scripts and tutorials would also be shared on Github. Executing the code could be done on Google Colaboratory.

Please let me know, what you think. Whether this tutorial idea has some potential or not. Please share your comments and also ideas or criticism. I would like to get some resonance and I also published a small introduction without any programming part yet, to build of a ""proper thread"" on Medium. A first programming part would follow on Tuesday.

I ended up here; and think it probably brings up topics which are worth considering in the context of our field specifically.)

&amp;#x200B;

Google pointed me at a short blog article this morning: ["" Decolonising maths and science degrees at Oxford""](https://gregashman.wordpress.com/2020/06/17/decolonising-maths-and-science-degrees-at-oxford/) which was a reaction to [an article in the Times](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/black-lives-matter-oxford-will-decolonise-degrees-c7dkhbtnd) regarding a statement from the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford.

I thought it gave an accurate description of how UK science and mathematics degrees are structured... ***that's the limit of the praise I can give it though.***

&amp;#x200B;

The author seems to have focused on their own biases against the humanities, perhaps fostered by the imprecise language that the VC had used (decolonise can and does mean vastly different things to different people); which gives it a rather divisive if not condescending tone...

More importantly for me he totally missed the point that:

* There are well documented issues with Ethnicity and STEM\*, as highlighted by incidents like that diatribe in [Angewandte Chemie](https://www.reddit.com/r/chemistry/comments/gx6a5w/something_is_seriously_wrong_over_at_angewandte/) the other week which expose the issues and attitudes festering beneath the surface.
* That's something we as a community can't just ignore, partially because it will result in us losing out on lots of potentially excellent scientists from Ethnic Minority backgrounds joining us to do great science, but mainly because we become morally complicit in the actions and inactions which cause discrimination and under-representation if we do nothing.

&amp;#x200B;

I did however find it ironic that his argument boils down to ""science degrees are divorced from the context of doing science in the real world, and don't teach the impacts that social structures have on science or that science has on the wider community; so there's no need to change them"", which actually illustrates why ensuring that potential scientists are educated with an understanding of the context in which their field exists, and their work is done, is important. 

Because if the author had that understanding, he'd have got that ""decolonisation"" means much more than changing curriculum materials, and that there are things the scientific and academic community can and should be doing to attract students, academics, and professionals from ethnic minority backgrounds and support them in reaching their full potential.

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I have **no idea** how to fix these problems, *but I'm 100% certain that denying we need to fix them won't be an effective solution.*

1)massless particle (photon) + photon collision

2) photon + mass (any material with mass) collision

3)photon + electron collision

My current theory is : 

1) Photons probably change their wavelength because other factors are constant but I don't know the ratio since both have no mass

2) Photons probably transfer their energy into mass until photon's wavelength low enough to pass through but what happens when photon has zero energy 

Also I'm not really looking for an answer for these questions . I want to fill my knowledge gaps which preventing me from answering these questions . I think issue is what happens after the Newtonian physics and I don't know where to start because every law I know become useless in quantum physics . 

Also I wonder something : Is it possible to fully understand these ? Like is there solid answer or just accepted theories ?",22,2020-05-02 03:12:28,2,2,2,2,2

I am sorry in advance if I am not understanding this correctly...I am new to RNAi.

Her argument in class was that our artificial microRNA has to be expressed in our viral vector as DNA not RNA and it will be incorporated into our organisms genome as transposable element so that it can be incorporated in our hosts’s genome.

iez0m9,Electric discharge,"Can electric discharge also occur from a positively charged object?

In the case of negatively charged object, electric field lines point towards the object, meaning that electrons want to go away from the object; a strong electric field will cause electrons to sort of escape, ionize the air, and discharge occurs.

But if an object is positively charged, field lines point away from the object, so electrons tend to stick to the object more, I believe. So, even if the electric field becomes very strong, won't the electrons tend to stick more to the object, meaning that discharge will not occur?

To summarize, does electric discharge occur regardless of the direction of the field line? (Assuming it is only the electrons that can move from the object).

I've taken bio classes before but am being exposed to it a lot more now and one thing I don't get is why are there so many abbreviations, and oftentimes without any consistent rules?

For example, mean arterial pressure is often written as MAP. But, why wouldn't it be written symbolically like &lt;P&gt;\_a or something like that, since &lt;&gt; historically has denoted averages, and subscript a for arterial?

Or another example, cancer often discusses mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), but it seems inconsistent to me that only the ""I"" (i.e. the prefix) in isocitrate survives the abbreviation process whereas both ""D"" (the prefix) and ""H"" (the root) of dehydrogenase are part of the main abbreviation. I'm sure there's some historical component to it, but was just wondering if there are rules? It's really hard to keep track of all of these abbreviations :/

We currently have an opening for a job that requires 1 year of prior experience writing trending and non-compliance reports. We got about 10 applications. All 3 of the people with MS degrees immidiately had their applications tossed because they're seen as being over qualified. They didn't even get interviews. Everyone knows they're just sticking their feet into the water and they're going to feel over qualified and move on within a year. We can't keep training new people every year when it takes about 4 months to get up to speed. We need people who are going to stay for 2-3 years, minimum.

The person who's likely to get the job has a BS degree from a no-name liberal arts college. But she's bright, personable, and knows that she doesn't know everything. She also doesn't even have year of experience writing trending and non-compliance reports. She admitted that to us, but told us she would throw her everything into learning everything we would teach her. That showed great initiative, and it's generally assumed by everyone here that once we get her up to speed she'll stay longer than the people with advanced degrees.

hqgsrr,Deciding on Pharmaceutical Chemistry vs Cosmetic Science/Product Formulation,"Deciding on whether to get a master's in pharmaceutical chemistry (PC) or cosmetic science (CS) or product formulation (PF) from Germany/UK. Currently taking free online courses on cosmetic formulation due to interest in skin/hair care, debating on whether to do a master's in PC due to a wider job opportunity, and a different industry to lean back to in case I wanted a career switch. I am interested in the business internship opportunities from the CS and PF program but unsure if it would help me secure a job in those respective countries as an international.   


Context:  
I've been out of school for about a year now with a Biochemistry degree (US), graduated without much working experience and had to move back to my home country due to error in visa application. Currently unable to find any relevant job without 2+ years in the industry. I initially planned on applying to a Medical Lab Scientist program, thus I mainly took biology courses, a few health science courses with only organic chemistry courses and a physical chemistry course w/o lab. Currently regret not taking an analytical chemistry course to at least be considered in a chemistry job. Had minor research experience in lab and internship in food formulation (3 months).    


When applying for jobs in my country(ASIA), the industry available are food/chemical/pharmaceutical manufacturing companies which required specific science degree such as food science, chemistry, engineering, nutrition, agriculture or pharmacy.  The typical job post in QA and regulatory positions would accept bioscience degree but wanted people with either years of experience or unskilled worker(high school leaver) in production line. The select few bioscience students that managed to enter those industries are either lucky (nepotism+networking) or have worked overseas a few years due to their postgraduate work visa. Majority of the bioscience degree holder I talked to went into sales before jumping into another industry unrelated to science. I tried applying for CRO (contract research organization) jobs but with no success since they much prefer people with a health science background.   


TLDR: Due to unfortunate circumstances on my visa, I had to leave US, and all the opportunities available to a Biochemistry degree holder. Without an industry demand for bioscience in my home country (Asia), I need advice on whether to get a Master's in Pharmaceutical Chemistry or Product Formulation/Cosmetic Science to diversify my career pathway/hiring opportunities in pharmaceutical/FMCG industry.",0,2020-07-13 10:01:25,0,1,1,1,1

fdurip,"Will deep space travel ever actually be possible? I'm thinking... sadly not. At least, not in the way we imagine.","Please stay with me :) I'm not skilled at condensing my thoughts and I have a tendency to ramble so I will re-edit before posting and thank you in advance if you do make it to the end. 

\-----

I love how when looking at pictures from say, Hubble, that we're actually looking back in time. It's really cool. But it presents to me what I find to be a really interesting problem. 

The thought experiment is based on the following principle. If we do figure out how to traverse space FTL, WHEN do we arrive at our destinations? I think it would *appear* to look like time travel. 

\[start\]

We develop a wormhole/stargate like device. Near instantaneous travel via the theoretically possible worm hole. We open one to Mars and our brave pioneer walks through. Once on the other side he sends a signal to the scientists monitoring. He reopens the gate and goes back through to Earth. The signal is a stand EM sub-light radio signal. 

In theory, he could sit and wait with the other scientists to receive that signal in approx 20 mins time. 

FTL travel would put you at your destination as it is right now, and not how we see it by conventional means. 

\[end\]

Expand that. The nearest star is \~4 light years away. Imagine that as I write this post, it's going supernova. We won't see it for 4 years. However if we could open a wormhole to near that star and send a spaceship through, we would be sending it to its instant death in the throes one of the most powerful explosions known to exist. Even at sublight what we would see when we get there is not what we went to see.  

Expand THAT. We see pictures of Stars, Nebulae etc. We want to visit them, but they're *really* far away. By sublight or by wormhole, what we see when we get there is NOT what we saw that made us want to go. Example, a Nebulae. It could have completely dispersed, or formed stars and left nothing behind, or any number of possibilities. 

The point is, what we see around us is NOT what we would be going out to visit. The further away it is, the more it is likely to have changed. 

With all this in mind, how can extra-solar travel EVER be practical, FTL or not? It could only ever be one way pure exploration. All these possible Earth Like Worlds we're seeing, could be nothing but balls of baron rock by now due to how long their light took to get to us. Any number of things could have caused it. 

This could also explain why we've never met any other technologically advanced species . It's just not actually practical, FTL or not. You receive a signal and go exploring. By the time you get there, they're long gone. Moved on, become extinct, any number of possibilities.

I feel like we are actually somewhat stuck in our own solar system, possibly forever. As our technology increases we can and will undoubtedly move further and further out and will almost certainly find ways to live on planets like Mars, Moons like Titan etc but ultimately, any extra-solar journey is going to be a one way ticket into the unknown. 

We could never *purposely* find a new home outside the solar system and go there, because it almost certainly wouldn't be what we saw when we finally arrived. 

The only future I see for humanity and space travel, are self sustaining/repairable generation ships that have no real destination and simply exist for the journey itself, with no real destination.",0,2020-03-05 06:48:12,2,2,0,2,2

fvabv9,I have a question about sampling uncertainty in measurement (Nordtest)," Hello there,

I can't find a good explanation on the replicate design method used to determine uncertainty due to sampling and due to analysis. From my understanding, it is a form of Nordtest quality control, as it represents the uncertainty as square sum of sampling and analysis uncertainty.

Other than that, in my course (I am a physics student), I am given a table of the measurement done by the method of 'replicate design'. This term causes me a lot of confusion. Just when I feel like I get the point of it, I look at the table and I can't relate to it. The table has inputs of concentration of iron (in something unknown - because this is just for practice, I am not dealing with any actual measurement), it is also taken from different targets. Would anyone be able to explain this to me?

I will attach the table. Thank you very much in advance!",0,2020-04-05 03:07:52,2,2,2,2,1

Recently, I purchased a test for phosphate in water. What I didn’t realize is that it has the whole shebang for warning labels due to its three different reagents- toxic, highly flammable, harmful, corrosive, irritant, etc. The most concerning one, however, is the #2 phosphate reagent that has the label “harmful for the environment”. And even worse, the box and instructions are useless for suggesting how to dispose of both the reagent and test after it’s done- it just states to clean the test tube with clean water.

The bottle states that it contains Antimony Potassium Tartrate. I assume this binds with the other reagents (reagent #1 has 10% sulfuric acid apparently, and #3 is a company secret I guess), as well as the 5 mL of water from the tank which you put in the test tube. To test, three drops of the antimony reagent are put in the tube in total.

I’m not familiar with this chemical at all so I don’t know how it would bond with the other reagents and with water. Would anyone be able to tell me it would be safe (for the environment especially) to pour a test containing 3 drops of this down the sink after its complete? If not, how should I safely dispose of it? Or is it just the pure #2 reagent that is the dangerous one?",4,2020-07-10 16:21:33,1,1,1,1,1
fdup0z,[Grade 12 Biology: General] Need help answering these questions.,"1. What is meant by animals having an innate immune system defense against disease-forming attackers?

&gt;The innate immune defense is part of the immune system and consists of the outer and inner defense. Unlike the adaptive immune system, or the acquired immune system, the innate immune system is very rapid and activates rapidly in response to an infection. The innate immune system, in turn, activates the innate immune system which has a much higher sensitivity to different types of infectious agents. The innate immune system recognizes only a limited number of microbes, while the adaptive immune system can produce antibodies and T cells against almost all types of antigens that exist. However, the adaptive defense is slow and may take weeks to develop a complete response.

2. Explain and exemplify catabolic and anabolic processes?   

&gt;Catabolism is the set of metabolic pathways that breaks down molecules into smaller units that are either oxidized to release energy or used in other anabolic reactions. Catabolism breaks down large molecules (such as polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids and proteins) into smaller units (such as monosaccharides, fatty acids, nucleotides, and amino acids, respectively). **Catabolism is the breaking-down aspect of metabolism, whereas anabolism is the building-up aspect.** Cells use the monomers released from breaking down polymers to either construct new polymer molecules, or degrade the monomers further to simple waste products, releasing energy. Cellular wastes include lactic acid, acetic acid, carbon dioxide, ammonia, and urea. The creation of these wastes is usually an oxidation process involving a release of chemical free energy, some of which is lost as heat, but the rest of which is used to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This molecule acts as a way for the cell to transfer the energy released by catabolism to the energy-requiring reactions that make up anabolism. (Catabolism is seen as destructive metabolism and anabolism as constructive metabolism). Catabolism therefore provides the chemical energy necessary for the maintenance and growth of cells. Examples of catabolic processes include glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, the breakdown of muscle protein in order to use amino acids as substrates for gluconeogenesis, the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to fatty acids, and oxidative deamination of neurotransmitters by monoamine oxidase.

3. Describe how a nerve impulse works, please draw.

A **nerve impulse** is the way nerve cells, or neurons, communicate with one another. Nerve impulses are mostly electric signals along the dendrites to produce a nerve impulse or **action potential**. The action potential is the result of ions moving in and out of the cell. Specifically, it involves potassium (K+) and sodium (Na+) ions. The ions are moved in and out of the cell by potassium channels, sodium channels and the sodium-potassium pump.

gqtykg,gas phase detection of water vapor - why not use NDIR?,"I've been looking for a gas phase trace water vapor sensor for a long time and I haven't been able to find one that fits my needs - spectroscopic instead of electrochemical for high life and low turn-on time,  does not cost $10k+, and can measure ppm levels of water vapor.

Seriously, there's a market for this sort of device for you CEOs out there.

Anyhow, I already know that non-dispersive infrared spectroscopy is frequently use for quantitation of gas phase CO2. Basically it's single wavelength IR spectroscopy for a characteristic NIR CO2 absorbance feature. For convenience, commercial sensors pick 4.3 microns: [https://www.soselectronic.com/articles/sensirion/scd30-is-more-than-just-the-ndir-co2-sensor-2152](https://www.soselectronic.com/articles/sensirion/scd30-is-more-than-just-the-ndir-co2-sensor-2152)

But what I notice is that H2O also has an absorbance feature at 1.4 microns on that graph!

True, this feature has interference from alcohols. but if you know that your gas stream only has water in it as an -OH containing species, it seems that you can make a NDIR gas sensor using a 1.45 micron NIR LED and a broadband, high sensitivity IR detector like a photodiode or thermopile, filtered at 1.45 microns.

Well, that's not always the case. You see, I needed to finish this online government class this week in order to graduate. The only thing standing between me and my diploma was this 7 page paper asking me to assess the quote unquote ""balance"" of the American government system. Well, I needed a way to fill up space--fast. I didn't know enough philosophical government jargon to fill it with that (heck, I probably couldn't write more than a paragraph using the information I learned in that good-for-nothing course), so I opted for the analogy route. Naturally, I compared the US to an acid base reaction where democracy is a buffer solution. Basically, I said US politics doesn't shift too much everytime a new president gets into office (like how the pH would change super quick without a buffer) because checks and balances and stuff (like buffer solutions) keep things from shifting too far from the norm until a serious amount of change occurs in the population (like when the moles of OH- or H+ ions exceed the buffers capacity). In the end I wrote four thick paragraphs explaining how acid base reactions work and how it's just like the government, which meant that I succeeded in including very few sensible arguments in my essay. And people say AP Chemistry is useless in everyday life!

feqc29,At what point in evolution did animals start to eat each other?,"At what point in evolution did animals start to eat each other? (SCIENCE ONLY)

Note: i tried Googling this question and for some reason, a good amount of the results came from Christian websites. I am a firm believer in evolution and do not think “god did it” is a solid answer. SCIENTIFIC/EVOLUTIONARY ANSWERS ONLY!

Anyways, here is what I want to know: I believe that life as we know it evolved from a single-celled organism billions of years ago. These organisms reproduced through mitosis over and over until they started to float to the surface of the ocean, where they learned photosynthesis and eventually became plants. But of course, not all of them evolved into plants. Others stayed in the ocean and evolved into other life forms that eventually became fish and such. I read that these organisms used a process called chemosynthesis to convert inorganic molecules into simple sugars, which is what bacteria would eat.

So this means that the first living things were self sufficient in that they were able to create their own food and also reproduce asexually. So at what point in evolution did it become beneficial for organisms to eat the flesh of another to survive? How did we, as living beings, go from photo/chemosynthesis and mitosis to eating mostly meat and plants?",7,2020-03-06 22:50:57,0,0,0,0,0

homoq2,Phagocytosis vs Pinocytosis,"I understand the basic idea of what the differences are.

Phagocytosis occurs when whole particles are taken in to be later broken down by enzymes. The process includes pseudopodia formation (protrusion of the membrane).

Pinocytosis occurs when already-dissolved/broken-down liquid particles are taken in, ready to be absorbed. This process includes invagination (forming of pouch by the membrane).

What I don’t understand are:
1. How does the cell knows that the particles they’re about to take in are whole particles or already-dissolved particles?
2. Why do cells form pseudopodia for whole particles and why do cells go through invagination for already-dissolved particles? Why can’t it happen vice-versa?
3. If the vacuole membranes from phagocytosis and pinocytosis in the same cell were formed by the same cell membrane, how do they detect which one has to be broken down and which one is already broken down?

Please help me understand the material! I have tried googling it but idk why I couldnt find the answer.

fxco07,No adaptation for years: What is going on?,"TLDR: What is this muscular condition or what has happened to the muscle?

&amp;#x200B;

Background:

28 years old. Male.

Patellar tendinopathy at 16.

Lots of rest and physical inactivity since 18, except for moderate walking.

Sleep + nutrition have been on point.

Been dealing with depression last few years.

&amp;#x200B;

The Problem:

Certain movements and exercises cause light shaking or trembling in my quads, and also cause a strange feeling of weakness or fatigue upon completion. This is not your typical ""muscle soreness"".

&amp;#x200B;

The Symptoms:

Trembling and shaking can occur during the movement. If I ignore these signals and power through a movement, I'll typically feel immediately weak after the set. Like my legs are lethargic or sluggish, which can persist into the next day. All of these feelings are distinct and aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.

&amp;#x200B;

Examples:

Most of the examples I can think of involve my quads:

&amp;#x200B;

    Walking down stairs or downhill (not even that steep)
    
    Squats, nearly any variation with no extra weight
    
    Climbing
    
    Longboarding (example below)

&amp;#x200B;

One Example:

Longboarding. I can stand upright on the board, but as soon as I bend my knees, even a slight bend, I'll typically start trembling. Not vigorously, but lightly. And if I hold the position even longer? This weird weakness begins to come on. It leaves me feeling weak, lethargic, with even more trembling if I try to preform the movement again. The next day I'll usually feel the same weakness, especially if I've ""overdone"" it, which literally doesn't take much at all. Doesn't take hitting the burn or fatiguing, just spending a bit of time in this trembling or weak state.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example is certain emotional states, such as if I'm in a fight or flight situation. The ""energy"" will leave my legs, and I'll begin feeling that same weak/powerless feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

Counter Examples:

    Walking (flat ground)
    
    Light dancing
    
    Soccer ball keepups
    
    Lower intensity cycling 
    
    Movements that ""feel good""
    
    Being in the zone (example below)

&amp;#x200B;

One time I was cheering and motivating my basketball team. I was so fired up and passionate, going from pacing back and forth, to squatting, and holding a semi-squat position, on and off for the whole game. After the game, I nearly immediately felt soreness in one of my quads. But it felt great. Today, if I tried to recreate that outcome, I would just hit weakness and trembling before achieving that soreness.

&amp;#x200B;

Another example was a few years ago when I walked for 20 kilometers a day, for 3 days straight. My quads felt pretty amazing after that whole experience, but I sustained achilles tendinopathy (which I'm still recovering from).

&amp;#x200B;

The Outcome:

Much of the training my quads get exposed to is maladaptive. A negative feedback loop.

The number of restrictions on intensity, volume, and frequency give me so little to work with.

I've seen no progression for years. Most likely due to lack of consistency with the right approach, which has been really tricky to find.

Even if I rest a few days, my body doesn't positively adapt. I won't get stronger, and my future capacity will decrease.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this is where the issue arises for me. The bottle of (3) Latic Acid from the replacement batch smells like the first original bottle of (1) Salicylic Acid I ordered the other month, and the replacement (3) Glycolic Acid smells like the new batch of (2) Salicylic Acid, and the replacement (3) Salicylic Acid smells like a weak Isopropyl alcohol

So, my question is. What do Salicylic, Lactic and Glycolic Acid Smell like?

gxqtgi,"What is this strange ""gas"" coming from my stairs?","Hi reddit!

So I was with my girlfriend watching a movie, and then suddenly we started coughing. 

There was no smell, but this sensation in the throat, like some funny substance was in the air.

We are on the 1st floor. We decide to leave the apartment and let the windows open.

In the stairs this sensation was even worse, and it made us cough, closing our throats.

Outside there was this neighbor from the 6th floor, that felt the same thing on the stair (from the 3rd floor to the base).

So we weren’t crazy. We called the firefighters, and they felt this strange thing (but their machines didn’t detect a single thing); they didn’t know the reason. Their advice was to leave the windows in the stairs open, just in case.

What is this thing? It has no smell at all. It just closes your throat and gives you a cough. I have this feeling that is some sort of chemical gas or something.

On the 0 floor, there is this manicure shop. In the quarantine they were close and I didn’t feel this “gas”. They reopened and this started again. This shop doesn’t have physical access to the stairs.

Is this an unhealthy thing? Am I getting crazy? Does somebody know something about this? Could it be related to this manicure shop?

fvx0c3,Hydrogen Embrittlement,"I was recently considering _hydrogen embrittlement_  of metals, and particularly how it is that a hydrogen _atom_  introduced into the body of the metal by some chemical process occuring at the surface can migrate through it until it reaches a cavity, at which point it 'drops-out' into the cavity &amp; combines with another hydrogen atom to form H₂, in which form it can migrate no further; and this H₂ can build-up until colossal pressure is reached ... so high a pressure that the metal can become embrittled if there is a sufficient density of such cavities. (Or the hydrogen atom may combine with carbon to form CH₄, with similar result.)

But this looks a bit too much on the face of it like a 'Maxwell's Demon' kind of process: and I wonder how the thermodynamics of it pans-out: what is the maximum pressure that can be reached in a hypothetical rigid cavity; and if the cavity becomes deformed, then what proportion of the energy available to this process (which as far as I can tell can _only be_  from the formation of the H₂ or the CH₄ from the atomic hydrogen or atomic hydrogen + carbon) goes-into the mechanical work of making the cavity bigger &amp; what proportion is dissipated as heat.

fv1wv6,"My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark Matter","  

**My theory of Gravity, Inertia, and Dark** **Matter**: 

I think of space as composed of multiple phases, such as air and water as to create a surface where bubbles can form. The various bubbles formed are matter, but it takes high temperatures to make the matter we know, the big bubbles, so the current space bubbles that form are very small and short lived. There will always be lots of little bubbles forming at the temperature of vacuum of \~3K, but should be much less and zero bubbles forming inside of matter as the inside of the big bubbles is only one phase (like just air). The surface of matter is a place where space wants to reconnect the big matter bubbles but there is not enough energy to do it, since those big bubbles were made when space was hotter. This will lead to a sticky force at the surface of matter, and oscillations causing wave propagation outward with a finite speed due to matter being jittered around. In addition, two separate masses (big bubbles) will interact with one another through the wave fields they create at their surfaces due to them being jittered around, creating interfering waves between them. The creation of standing waves between them takes time (finite speed of space waves), in addition to the surface sticky force, giving rise to resistances to changes (inertia). Therefore, large masses in the galaxy and the universe may control the inertia as they control the standing waves that pervade the observable universe. This particle jitter due to zero-point fluctuation making little bubbles trying to recombine with the big bubbles is the quantum temperature jittering the big bubbles around.

So, there is jitter and standing waves between particles (big bubbles) due to the field waves they setup around their surfaces which propagate outward to interfere with one another. This causes two masses to emit waves towards one another interacting with one another with a delay due to their finite speeds. These waves at the surface of opposite particles distort the zero-point fluctuations by reducing them by adding more noise to the jitter (interference). This reduction which reduces the sticky force on the side of the particle facing the other particle results in an attractive force, and they begin to move towards one another creating the force of gravity.

Then, these things naturally give rise to large space distortions around matter where the zero-point fluctuations are distorted by matter and the standing wave interferences extending far outward, giving rise to matter like effects which then give rise to dark matter.",10,2020-04-04 16:41:05,2,2,2,2,2

fvfz0n,How does water dissociate in this situation?,"I was reading Stewart book on acid base status and i didn't understand one concept that he made so simple.

If you have a solution of water and diluted strong ions (eg. Na+ and Cl-):

\[Na+\] - \[Cl-\] + \[H+\] - \[OH-\] = 0 

If the concentration of Na+ and Cl- is equal, thats ok to understand. But if we have double the concentration in mEq/L of \[Na+\] for example. 1mEq/L and 2mEq/L for example. 

2 - 1 + \[H+\] - \[OH-\] = 0 

\[H+\] must be 0 and \[OH-\] must be 1mEq/L. **How can this be possible if for a \[OH-\] to appear in the solution,  \[H+\] must also appear?** 

H20 &lt;-&gt; (H+) + (OH-) ?

For \[OH+\] to appear to equilibrate the electrical charges, what would happen with the H+ that should appear?",0,2020-04-05 10:57:03,1,1,1,1,1

hr7uza,Biology major VS Biochemistry,"Hi! 

I asked this question in the biochem subreddit too but, not surprisingly I suppose, I got only answers telling me I should chose biochem. But I also want to hear the opinion of people who love biology. 

I just finished my masters in the humanities, and would like to do something in the sciences. Life fascinated me. Where does life begin? How does it function? What defines it? 

As such, I think biochem would be more suited to me, as biology seems to be more focused on bigger organisms (tell me if I’m wrong). 


The one thing that pushed me more towards biology, is that there’s less chemistry and slightly less maths, both of which I’m terrible at, and it is more important to learn vast amounts of information and relate these informations to each other, which I am good at. (Again, tell me if my conception is wrong)


I’m looking forward to your answers !",20,2020-07-14 14:15:02,0,0,0,0,0
f8vyaw,"I see size as another dimension, by this logic we live in 6 dimensions instead of 4. Am i wrong?","English is not my first language, sorry for any weird wordings. The idea is that zooming in and out can be seen as moving along a different axis than spacial or time based movement. 

Theoretically we can zoom in and out without moving in space or time. This being a movement along a separate dimension speaks to me since in practise we arrive at seemingly different universes completely with seemingly different laws of nature (from galaxies to atomic or quantum level). 

As human we occupy a set space within the size dimension (when zooming in/out when does the area containing the human body stop being able to be classified as a human) similarly to how we exist in an area of time and an area of space (where does the human body stop / where does a human life end)

The argument that we do not know whether we can move along the 'size' axis indefinitely (min of planck length) can also be made about time (before big bang) and space (end of universe). The argument that we cannot wilfully move along its axis (while conserving ourselves), i feel is also insufficient as similarly we are not able to move backwards in time. 

A more far fetched consequence of this could be that: if zooming in on space is moving through the 5th dimension, then zooming in on time can be seen as movement through yet another, 6th, dimension. We know it is possible to zoom in on time as heavy gravity (think interstellar, lightspeed or black holes) slows down time.  

I am not looking for confirmation of being right, im looking for confirmation that i am not wrong (why is it impossible to think that size is another dimension). I do think this view ultimately comes down to ""depending how you look at it"", but if i make clear contradictions / illogical statements i would love to correct my beliefs. 

A more formally formed statement of this would have to do with accepting that existence (or reference to be philosophically correct) is forcefully tied to a reference frame. This implying that it is wrong to be talking about points in space and time, as to our knowledge only areas in space and time can be defined/referenced to/exist.

I do not know anywhere else to ask about this, and could not find information about it via google. Thanks for reading, hope i did not come off as vague or pretentious.",11,2020-02-24 12:48:57,2,2,2,2,2

My setup uses 2 Alfa Laval centrifuges and various chemicals to create a floc so that ultra fine particles can be bonded to high gravity solids and discharged as dry waste to be hauled off. My machines can only handle roughly 1200 g’s for the volume I pump and the bigger I can get my floc the drier The “cuttings” underflow for those familiar with centrifuges I can produce hence the efficiency of my work. Calcium nitrate is used as an inorganic coagulant as I’ve found the hardness is best for dewatering at 3000 ppm. the flocculant I use is a 60%  cationic polymer and I use hydrated lime and citric acid to adjust my ph to a 9 as recommended per company specs for the polymer I use. This is pretty standard issue for the industry and I’m looking for ways to improve it. given the down turn any penny I can save in drying agent is going to put me one step ahead of competition I’m not much of a chemist I’m a blue collar guy and I was curious if any of you could offer insight to help me progress in my career in these tough times,0,2020-04-17 21:07:05,1,1,1,1,1

hgs5zu,Can a reptilian creature thermoregulate using a sail?,"Hi! This is a hypothetical question for fiction purposes. I am creating a race of lizard men for a fantasy story, and I would like input on my ideas for their biology. 

My lizard men are warm-blooded and need to be able to be as physically active as humans. As far as I understand, one weakness of reptiles is that they cannot swear like mammals and hence have trouble cooling down.

I have an idea to make my lizard men regulate temperature using a sail on their back and head. My idea is that when warm, they'll pump blood into and through the sail to let it cool down, and when cold they'll retract blood from the sail to retain their body heat.

Does this make sense biologically and physically? Is this idea workable?

I like it because it allows for cool body language: A lizard man flushing his sail with blood can indicate excitement or stress (like sweating or blushing in a human), while drying out the sail can indicate calmness or even fear (like shivering). So that's nice for story purposes. But does it make sense?

So I've decided to go back to school. I was a police officer for a few years but got injured and can no longer be a cop.

fihrnf,Looking for someone for a half hour whatsppvideocall on electromagnetism,"I want to understand how magnetism works on an atomic level. 

&amp;#x200B;

More specifically I want to understand how an inductivity works. 

Given a current in a wire, around the current a magnetic field arround the wire emerges.

This magnetic field contains Energy.

This Energy is used that even if the voltage is turned off, the current can still flow.

The force of the magnetic field opperates in such a way that it generates a voltage which works against the source voltage. (So if the source voltage goes to 0 the genertated voltage ensures that the current is stabilized)

The Background of this Lenz' Rule is Energy concersation

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The first Statement in this series of deduction is that magnetic fields emerges if electirc charges (electrones) are moving.

&amp;#x200B;

In our call I hope you can explain me on an atomic Level, if an electrone spins around the protone (core of a hydrogene atom) why does a magnetic field emerge around the Orbit of the electrone?

&amp;#x200B;

I want to understand the force why it spins around the protoe in the first place because after some Research on my own I suppose that this force is the cause of the magnetic field.

&amp;#x200B;

As a thought experiment, and to try and refresh my long rusty maths and physics, i want to know, if the sun suddenly 'switched off' and the surface was instantly plunged into darkness, how long would the surface take to radiate its energy into space until it reached the background radiation level of 2.7K?
for a 1 square metre of surface, i think i can calculate the amount of radiation  emitted into space with the equation:

watts emitted = eσ(T1^4 - T2^4)
where e is emmisivity (0.88 for the moon?), σ is the stefan-boltzman constant 5.67037 x 10^-8, T1 is the starting temperature ( 381K), T2 is the background temperature (2.7k). 
this gives me 1051 watts/ m^2 .

We are  ""only"" measuring visibility and temperature on a fixed underwater station. The temperature is currently being automated with a sensor constantly measuring data - so far so good.

Now I would like to do further measurements and gather more information. I could go into the direction of fish identification (even if rare) or plant identification. Also, it could go into the direction of measuring more values (ph value?).

Now I need ideas or some input on where I could start as a non-biologist (I'm a software engineer) what I could do/measure/collect/document that could:
 a. be helpful data in the future to document ecological change
 b. give information about the current quality of water/plants/nature.

I’m preparing to go back to school this Fall 2020 and soon and I’ll need to take a 3-quarter General Chemistry series but before I take that my school needs me to take a General Chemistry Prep class that will cover these topics: 

”This course focuses on the following topics: the scientific method, measurements and the metric system, dimensional analysis and problem-solving, matter and energy, atomic theory, chemical bonding and intermolecular foces, chemical nomenclature, chemical reactions including oxidation-reduction reactions, stoichiometry and limiting reactants, solutions and concentration, acid-base reactions and pH.”

Is there a good book this thread can recommend  which covers these topics??

I have the option to test out of the prep class (saving me money!) and then going straight to the 3-quarter series. 

I’m aware of Khan academy but I  prefer a nice textbook that I can self study with at my own pace.

We’re a small little club of about 15 regular members, we are (or at least were) expanding and overlapping with other STEM clubs on campus though. 

We used to actively tutor local high school students, host speakers and little pizza parties afterwards to socialize and network. We would also partake in other activities like little fields trips to local observatories and have events devoted to the chemistry of cooking. 

I’ve been able to work out virtual tutoring with the local high schools.  Working on hosting online speakers too. But I’m having issues thinking outside the box and I’m not sure where to go from here? 

I really want to incorporate other events where we feel more comfortable being goofy college kids instead of being professional 100% of the time. Because it’s a small group, we’re all really good friends with mutual appreciation for the sciences. Our little fields trips and cooking nights where a way for us to forget about finals and studying for a brief second and just enjoy each other’s company and the sciences. I’m hoping to recapture that element, especially with everything going on in our world, I really hope I can create a safe and fun space too. 

I’ve only been able to think of online movie nights. I feel like I’ve hit a wall. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",5,2020-08-17 19:22:29,2,1,1,1,1

Bought a backboard mounting bracket. https://www.competitiveedgeproducts.com/Lifetime-Basketball-Backboard-Mounting-Bracket-1044-Adjustable-Height_p_61.html&amp;utm_source=GoogleCPC&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=product?dfw_tracker=11389-61&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw_-D3BRBIEiwAjVMy7DrHv3CNpe3tOdOcmsmUJWCVRb5z_q5ybhrRVoVunWj5J-tKhHh9ehoC5hMQAvD_BwE

Backboard expensive so want to make own. Thinking acrylic (plexiglass). Wondering how big a backboard I can use. regulation is 72 inch by 42 inch. other sizes are 60inch by 33inch, 54 inch by 33 inch, 52 inch by 33 inch, 48 inch by 30 inch. How do I know what the bracket/pole can withstand?

Also some backboards come with a metal frame does this make a difference? My backboard gonna literally be a sheet of acrylic with rounded edges.


Also want to know which thickness is best to mimic the NBA backboard which is TEMPERED GLASS. 

&gt;Backboard Glass Matters Too - Look for 54″ or 60″ size boards with 3/8″ thick glass and 72″ boards with 1/2″ glass for gym-correct rebound. 3/8″ glass on a 54″ or 60″ backboard provides the same rebound as a regulation 72″ backboard made of 1/2″ glass but has the advantage of being lighter making it easier to adjust the rim height for your little ones. We use 1/2″ thick glass only on our regulation 72″ systems such as the CV72 and DC72E1, same as used in the NBA and NCAA. https://basketballgoalstore.com/blog/what-size-backboard-do-i-need/

saw this not sure if they're referring to tempered glass or acrylic (plexiglass).


&gt;Look for acrylic backboards made from 1/2 inch thick acrylic for the best ball response which will provide approximately 85% of the ball response of tempered glass. https://www.firstteaminc.com/articles/glass-vs-acrylic-backboards

&gt;Tips - Ridout Plastics, a plexiglass manufacturer, recommends protecting the new backboard from the elements and help the plastic retain its luster with a quality automobile paste wax. Apply a thin, even coat of wax with a soft flannel or jersey cloth. Buff lightly. After polishing, wipe with a clean damp cloth to ground any electro-static charges which may attract dust particles. https://www.sportsrec.com/make-own-plexiglass-backboard-8768957.html

fdp8z5,In need of some advice/opinions about careers," Hi all, I'm currently a junior in college and I'm trying to decide what I want to do after I graduate. As I kid I was (and I still am) greatly fascinated by astrophysics - particularly cosmology. However as I have begun taking upper level courses I've gained interest in particle physics and unexpectedly optical physics. As I've learned more about physics, I unfortunately ( and somewhat excitedly) find out just how much more there is to learn. I'm starting to wonder if it is even possible for me to continue studying (as a graduate student) all of the fields that interest me, or if I need to accept my fate and focus on building a career in a specific area. I also don't know whether I want to go into research or theory. I have a feeling my skill in math is not strong enough for theory. As for research, I enjoy the ability to often get some kind of tangible result - it is satisfying, but I don't know if I would like to spend my life doing it. So I thought I would ask you all how you decided. What led you to decide your specific area and focus, and how did you decide between theory and research? I'm also facing a considerable amount of burnout, and have started a data science minor that would ideally allow me to work commercially as a data scientist until I feel confident enough to return for a PhD - however I'm worried I will lose momentum (pun intended). What do you guys think? Is it feasible for me to work as a data scientist for a few years until I feel ready to start my PhD, or will I likely never return to begin a PhD?",0,2020-03-04 21:39:42,2,2,2,2,2
gdao9t,Microwaving Schlenk flask while connected to vacuum gas manifold,"Consider a method where reactants are heated in a microwave field, and the products formed from the reaction are air sensitive. Does anyone know of a method to safely microwave a Schlenk flask while it is connected to a vacuum gas manifold?

I was considering buying a cheap microwave, and drilling a precise hole for the rubber tubing to pass through so that the Schlenk flask could be placed inside a microwave while the manifold is outside. What would be ideal is if I had some special tubing which had a metal mesh inside to complete the Faraday cage on the door of the microwave. This tubing would allow gas to pass through while blocking the microwave field. If I can't find such special tubing, I was thinking of making a metal mesh dome to surround the tubing on the outside of the door so that any microwave radiation leaking from the hole would be greatly diminished.",13,2020-05-04 07:26:51,1,1,2,1,1

g5swnc,Looking for career advice as a recent Wildlife and Conservation Biology Major,"Hello everyone,

As the title says I recently graduated with a BS in wildlife and conservation biology, but I’m having trouble choosing a career path. I loved working outdoors during my college courses, and doing the research projects, but I have no research experience other than research projects done for class. However, I currently work at my local ASPCA as an animal care attendant, and my boss has offered me a promotion to dog training assistant. She really thinks I should pursue certification as a dog trainer due to how capable I am, and how much I enjoy it. So I guess my issue is that I do love dog training (because I love animal behavior, I.e. franz de waal, temple grandin, Konrad Lorenz, etc), but I also love wildlife biology. I’m afraid I am leaning towards becoming a dog trainer, because it’s the path of least resistance, but also because I don’t see a lot of opportunity in wildlife biology with a BS and no research experience. I’m also very worn out on academia, and am VERY hesitant to go for a masters degree. 

To help with giving advice here is some background on me. I originally had taken a year off between high school and college. I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to go to college for (I was torn between music, and biology), and I knew i wanted to save some money first. I’ve never been exceptionally academically driven, but do fairly well nonetheless. I ended up getting my General education credits out of the way at a local community college. I then went on to a state university for my degree. However, as I pursued my BS I never gained experience doing research (besides through my assignments). Most of my experience is wildlife/animal care, and education (interned under a zookeeper, interned taking care of raptors, taught nature programs through my states Audubon society, and I currently work at my local ASPCA). 

Is there any overlap between wildlife biology, and dog training? Is it possible to use dog training as a stepping stone into wildlife biology research later? Should I sacrifice my promotion to see if I can gain research experience to make a more informed decision? 

If anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!",1,2020-04-21 21:23:41,0,0,0,0,0

f9zrkp,"Is ""left and right"" fundamental in physics or arbitrary?","A mental picture to understand this question is as follows. Imagine an alien spacecraft is on a collision course to crash into Earth and destroy us all.

All the aliens in the craft are dead except one. He is in the cockpit, with no windows, which is a plain white coloured room with two buttons on the wall. If he presses the left button, the ship will accelerate and blow up planet Earth. If he presses the right button the ship will stop moving, and everyone will be saved.

You know he has to press the right button, but he does not know which to press. You are on Earth and have managed to hack into a radio channel to communicate with the alien.

Luckily you are hooked up to a universal voice translator that contains a dictionary of the alien language, so you can talk to him.

But alas, there is a malfunction and the dictionary entries for the words ""left"" and ""right"" have been accidentally erased.

The question is this: are you really doomed, or is there a way you can tell him which button to press?

You are allowed to assume the alien spacecraft has a physics laboratory and that the alien can perform any physics or chemistry experiment you instruct him to do involving polarization, particle physics, radioactive decay, crystal handedness, spin, parity, molecular chirality, etc. Any experiment you can think up, the alien can do in time to save the planet.

Is there an experiment you can make him do that will resolve left and right so that you can then communicate which button to press to save planet Earth?

Is left and right deeply embedded in some physical phenomena, or are they entirely human convention?

\[In case you conclude there is no way to determine left or right, to finish off the puzzle you then need to state what the next best course of action is to get the best probability of saving the planet, but this has nothing to do with ""left and right."" This last part of the question is a simple probability question just for completeness.\]

Do you have anny tips you could share regarding the following:

I have acetic anhydride in my lab and a variety of aromatic solvents and esters that are in every day use. I'm thinking to put menthol cristals in acetic anhydride with the addition of conc sulphuric acid. Will that yeald anny results.

Also, Is it possible to make menthone with conc chrome-sulphuric acid we use for cleaning glassware. Maby with cyvlohexane as a solvent?

Sorry for sparse info, haven't yet put it on paper.

Thank you for answers :-D",1,2020-07-01 11:19:26,1,1,1,1,1

And it would be very strong, right? Considering PR drops can withstand even 10, 000 KG of weight on the lower end...

So you could in theory have something like a kitchen island (without cabinets/drawers) made of stacked PR drops?

In practically the next lesson they go ""and btw, this element has 20+ protons shoved microscopically close together"".  Why do atoms stay together instead of exploding?  The only explanation I've ever found is that somehow there is a nuclear force that holds it all together.  Have we really met the limits of modern physics in a high school class, or do I just not understand nuclear force enough?  How does it work.  Why does it pull inward.  How does it only pull just enough to keep things from exploding, but not enough to like...fuse/collapse the atom?

I'm currently a  second year Chemistry (BS)/Physics (BA) double major looking to go to grad school for probably Material Science Engineering as it seems to be the best combination of Chemistry, Physics, and Engineering. Financially and research wise, it seems as though material science engineering has great potential for me.  My ultimate goal is to do meaningful research but also be able to run my own research firm eventually.

My question is how should I structure my Chemistry and Physics classes now to get more of an engineering side of things instead of just the pure science. My school allows for a good bit of choice in electives in the Physics major after taking the required classes. I already have Calc 1-3 under my belt and will be taking differential equations next semester. I will also be taking Experimental Physics. Analytical Chemistry, and Biochem, along with a possible gen ed or business class.

For the finance/business side of things, would you guys recommend taking classes in school or just reading books outside of class to build those skills.

Looking for opportunities in bio geared towards female high school students. 

Quick background, I attend a highly ranked STEM magnet high school which (as expected) is heavily male dominated, our school 72% male as of this year. While this class makeup does provide a unique hs experience, certainly with some pros, it can become overwhelming constantly being one of 2-4 girls in a class of 18. (Almost all of our teachers are male as well, and after taking near 16 classes I've had only one female STEM teacher.) My school has provided me with some amazing opportunities and I've done some great programs, but still they are all like my school day experience in male to female ratio.

I was wondering if anyone knows of some excellent female science programs / mentorships (online options would be great during this whole period) where I could for once be surrounded by female students who love STEM as much as I do, and possibly connect with professional female scientists as well.

ibvt15,Men Die Younger Than Women Hypothesis,"       On avg the woman lives longer than the man. The long pregnancy and vulnerability of a woman and child cause the man to have a shorter life span, in a reproductive evolutionary take.

       Wouldn’t it make more sense for men to outlive their women counterparts?. The man can fertilize and procreate many at a time, without the dreaded MENopause affecting their capability. So to continue procreating, as much as possible, it is more beneficial for men to live as long as possible - allowing them to spread their seed as much as possible! Especially since an old man can procreate almost as long as they live, while women become capable in their pre-teens til their 40’s (that’s only about 30 years!) Women also must carry a fetus to 9 months (high risk), nurse and care for the baby; thus fractioning the probability of many successful reproductions. The child also gains much independence around the age of 14 (needing the mother’s care up til then, occupying the women, and limiting their number of reproduction). Once the woman can no longer reproduce or care for a child (like in most animal kingdoms), they are less protected and weaker (age) - leading them to be more prone to early death. Whereas, the man would be surrounded by women and children - less likely to die early.
       
         The must-have protection from the male species - that the female species and child need through pregnancy, birth, and years of care - changes the male species’ behavior. The protective behavior will thus cut their lifespan. Therefore, the hunter-gatherer evolutionary step switched the circumstances. 
Male and female species work one-to-one in order to reproduce more successfully. Rather than the males reproducing at high numbers  but with less successful reproduction (more children likely to die due to lack of support and protection). 

         Their is so much more to this than I can type, and so many other tangents/exceptions, so don’t come for me! Lol! 

Remember evolution is happening as we speak! 

Long hypothesis short: men should live longer bc they can reproduce more, but they don’t bc they help protect their children and put themselves in more harm’s way. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY!",9,2020-08-18 01:27:25,0,0,0,0,0

My question is; coalas eat mainly eucalyptus trees. Eucalyptus trees are very tolerant of bushfires and som species have seeds that won't pop/grown unless the temperature pushes a threshold. Why were this Bushfire so dramatic for coalas? I thought that the coalas indirectly benefitted from the bushfires in Australia. I get that this fire effected huge areas. But still.

Study:


Background:
The possibility of side effects associated with the electromagnetic waves emitted from mobile phones is a controversial issue. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone use on parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein, amylase, lipase, immunoglobulin A, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase and C-reactive protein.
Methods:
Stimulated salivary samples were collected simultaneously from both parotid glands of 86 healthy volunteers. Salivary flow rate and salivary concentrations of proteins, amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin, peroxidase, C-reactive protein and immunoglobulin A, were measured. Data were analysed using t-tests and one-way analyses of variance.
Results:
Salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations of protein were significantly higher on the right side compared to the left in those that predominantly held mobile phones on the right side. In addition, there was a decrease in concentrations of amylase, lipase, lysozyme, lactoferrin and peroxidase.
Conclusion:
The side of dominant mobile phone use was associated with differences in salivary flow rate and parotid gland salivary concentrations, in right-dominant users. Although mobile phone use influenced salivary composition, the relationship was not significant.",1,2020-04-05 06:00:52,0,0,0,0,2

gcrr72,What forces are involved on a falling sheet of paper ?,"Hello, I'm working on a small physics project in Unreal Engine (a game engine) where I try to replicate the movement of a falling sheet of paper.

I'm struggling to understand the influence of lift force and air resistance. From my understanding air resistance is just here to slow down a moving object by resisting it's movement, I've tried implementing air resistance in such way that depending on how much of the surface of the paper faces the ground, the drag coefficient evolves, here is an example:  


 https://imgur.com/6W1rmG8 The paper is parallel to the ground and has a drag coefficient of around 0.85  
 https://imgur.com/AGlb5lw After hitting an obstacle on one of the corner while falling, the paper gained some torque and started rotating, I use the green area to calculate the drag coefficient.  


This method successfully slows down/accelerates the paper depending on it's rotation but it never stops to rotate after hitting the object. Also when the paper falls, it falls perfectly straight which isn't the case in real life at all.  


So I'm wondering, is the ""gliding"" movement of a sheet of paper the result of a lift force or have I implemented my air resistance wrong ?  


PS: My paper does not deform at all.",2,2020-05-03 09:44:44,2,2,2,2,2
fb9gf3,Why isn't the why of things emphasized in education pertinent to physics?," 

Students are taught to carry out a procedure for solving a problem but we are virtually never taught why the procedure works. Let me give an example: the problem is to convert decimal to binary, the teacher provides a procedure which gives the binary number, but he never explains why the method worked in the first place. This is the case with everything that is taught in school, I can't help but wonder why this is the case, I feel like knowing why your tools work is as important as knowing how to use them.

I'm really interested in doing research, but what if the tools I use to do research like math, computer science, physics, etc, aren't well understood, how can I be sure that the conclusions I derive are true? I know their true because someone created these tools but how do I know that these tools work? Do I have to just put faith in these tools?

I know I can sit down and try to figure out why these tools work out on my own but it's highly discouraged because you don't get rewarded for it by the education system, it's the same as wasting your time, a person who spends time understanding the tools is at a severe disadvantage to a person who doesn't care as much. It's hard to figure out why somethings work when you are given a deadline. I don't why many things work, albeit I can use them very well. It makes me dubious of the results I produce.

Perhaps in graduate and undergrad studies, they finally explain how all the tools we have been using work? Is that right? If not then isn't this a big issue? why aren't people solving such a big problem? If we aren't taught about the why of the working of our beloved tools, are the researches producing results they cannot be sure of?

hov0zo,Quantum Physics - Observer Effect,"Hello

I'm sorry if this is not the correct place to post this.  I recently stumbled upon a podcast which I do not want to link to, but also a snippet from a book called ""The thought that changed my life forever"". In the podcast and this book, both imply that electrons appear only when a person is measuring or observing the electron.

The person in the podcast I listened to said and I quote ""only when an observer focuses their attention on any location of an electron would it suddenly magically appear."" They then go on to explain how because of this we can create any reality we can think of. Is it accurate to say that the electrons magically appear?

In the book, from the first few paragraphs [here](https://books.google.ca/books?id=NlQF_eCGgZEC&amp;pg=PT81&amp;lpg=PT81&amp;dq=electrons+exist+in+a+invisible+field+of+energy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jGOhlqCT47&amp;sig=ACfU3U2MAWHSB0W9Z8TIiisy3-hhKdXt0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj7i_GLoMPqAhVQn-AKHSSND08Q6AEwC3oECA0QAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false),  it says ""our subjective minds produce measurable changes on the objective world! At the sub-atomic level, energy responds to our mindful attention and becomes matter. It's scientific fact.""

Am I completely mistaken or have both individuals misunderstood what the observer effect is? The observer is not a subjective mind or the person attempting to look at/measure the electron, but the measuring device itself, is it not? The measuring device interacts with and alters the state of what they measure, which then leads into superposition and the uncertainty principle when it comes to quantum mechanics.",10,2020-07-10 14:07:01,2,2,2,2,2

He gets his stuff from YouTube videos and dubious books without citation. I tried my best with high school knowledge but I failed.

His arguments are:

1. Pictures of viruses are either fake, or pictures of other organisms

2. There is no proof that viruses can make you sick (illnesses are the bodies reaction to environmental influences or bacteria)

3. Apparently someone wrote a book about how viruses are invented by the pharma industry to sell vaccines (he’s also an anti-vaxxer)

4. The original definition of virus is “anything smaller than a bacteria” and no one was ever able to isolate such a thing

After almost a year a change occured. It seems that the fungi started to grow on the walls of the container. The growth did not expand from the cheese but emerged all over the walls of the container.

I figure I will first need to find the halfway point between the initial and target rotation vectors, so that thrust can be reversed halfway there so that we stop rotating at the target rotation, but I am a bit confused about how all of this works in relation to the quaternion representation that Unity uses.

**Why does time seem to move in one direction?**

Okay so let's consider time to be a force, now what are forces? A force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. A force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity, i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. Now forces move in all directions as I stated ‘and direction…’, but time is not a force even i said let’s consider it to be one, time is dimension, if time were it would move in different directions. If time were a force time travel would be possible but time is not a force it is a dimension, we can experience many dimensions, we humans have theories of dimensions, we live in a 4 or 5 or even more dimensional world, the forth being time, and fifth being a unity between gravity and electromagnetism to create a theory fundamental forces, now we cant see time, but we can experience it, we age, we grow old. Now that leads us to believe time travels in one direction, but can we prove that? I don't believe we can, what leads us to assume that we can't time travel making time go backwards is our lack of means. We as species do not have the intelligence and the means to prove time moves in one singular direction. If we did have the intelligence and the means we would probably be able either deny that time moves in a singular direction, allowing us to manipulate time to our convenience or we could prove that time in fact can not be manipulated by measly beings such as humans and for us it moves in a singular direction. Now i'm not going to leave this here, I haven’t even covered half a page, most of this “**theory**” is just common knowledge. If time is a dimension why can't we change it? Why can’t we physically interact with time? Our only interaction with time, is it passing by us making us older or are we passing by it? Is time stationary and we are just experiencing its affects or is it passing through us and effecting us directly, does time affect anything else other than what we know? A definition of a dimension is ‘a measurable extent of some kind, such as length, breadth, depth, or height.’ so in every other dimension we can change it some way or the other, correct? The 3 dimensions we occupy on a day to day basis can be changed, how? We can change the length of something, the height, the width, the depth, and the breadth, but we can not change time, why is that? Well as i have stated before we simply do not have the means, to acquire those means we need intelligence, a lot of it, which this time we simply do not possess, and relating this to the answer for ‘Why does time seem to move in one direction’, well to put it simply we currently do not have the means to explain why it seems to move in a singular direction nor we have the means to prove weather if we can manipulate time or not. Currently we think of ourselves as  an advanced species who understand basics the fundamentals of this universe, but we do not understand it, there may be a species long after humans are gone that may be far more intelligent or far more stupid. But for what i think of it is. Time moves in a circular pattern. History repeats itself. Humans before, cavemen would have found artifacts left by a species we do not know of and they perhaps did not possess the knowledge to understand what those artifacts contained, perhaps they contained the answers to the question we have now, or the contained something completely different and the earlier, less intelligent version of our species did not think much of it and disposed of it, and it vanished over time, but some may have been able to understand some of it advancing the human civilization. But all of this depends on an **IF** or a **PERHAPS**, this is my theory, my opinion and if anyone has any additions or anything just tell me, i will sure take that into consideration, and i might even change my opinion on this, who knows. Only **time** will tell.

**Where did all the antimatter go?**

Let's take a look at what antimatter is, so antimatter is molecules formed by atoms consisting of anti-protons, anti-neutrons, and positrons. But stable antimatter does not appear to exist in our universe, so the question should be **‘Where did all the stable antimatter go?’.** Simply put, I do not think we as a species do not have the intelligence and means (as i stated with the previous question) to figure this out. But I believe that we could try to figure this out, I will go on with what i know (know keep in mind i am the furthest thing from a physicist ). And that is nothing, I have no clue about this so, people take off in the comments with theories.

fajmjt,"In detail, exactly what happens when a beam of antimatter is fired at a matter target?","I'm aware of the usual commentary on matter-antimatter annihilation. I wanted to push down a couple of levels deeper, as there are some things that don't quite make sense to me.

My perhaps overly-simplified model is that antimatter can be though of as a ""hole"" that can be filled only by the corresponding matter baryon, with the resulting total conversion of the mass into some number of energetic photons.

For the purposes of this discussion, I am going to assume a non-relativistic collision. Of course, given the amount of energy generated, relativity comes into play fairly quickly (though I'm not sure exactly how that matters.)

The problem structure is: one gram of anti-iron, Fe-56 say, is shot at, via magnetic field acceleration and inside a perfect vacuum, a target of, say normal carbon C-12.

Let's look at what happens, picosecond by picosecond (more or less.)

The first few anti-Fe-56 atoms approach the C-12 atoms. The orbiting positrons are directly attracted to the orbiting electrons and annihilate. Photons start going every which way.

The protons in the C-12 nucleus become exposed. They start repelling the remaining positrons still orbiting the anti-iron. First question: won't that cause the ionized anti-iron to bounce away from the C-12 and stop energy production? (I suspect there will just be a small trajectory change, since there's no Pauli exclusion going on -- the anti-iron will just dodge the anti-Fe ion.)

The anti-iron penetrates further into the C-12 layers. The .5MeV gamma rays from the electron-positron annihilations are causing anti-iron and carbon atoms to scatter, but also potentially making it easier for them to combine.

At some point, the nuclei of the anti-iron become fully exposed. Anti-protons from the anti-iron nuclei reach out hungrily for all of the naked carbon nuclei that are now both expanding at nearly the speed of light. Even higher energy gamma rays, at 2GeV, are generated by the annihilating protons and neutrons. Second question: wouldn't the neutrons and anti-neutrons just expand in a cloud? Sure, most of them would convert when the anti-nucleus and nucleus collide, but any anti-neutrons left over would just fly away (there's no electromagnetic force pulling at them.)

Finally, we see an ever expanding cloud of ultra-high energy protons, unreacted C-12 and anti-iron nuclei, and anti-neutrons that rapidly decay into an anti-proton, a positron, and a neutrino of some flavor. Presumably, a fair amount of anti-hydrogen is produced when the anti-protons grab hold of nearby positrons. (Since the anti-neutrons are relativistic, they can travel fairly far, and it's possible no anti-hydrogen will be formed, as the various antiparticles move too far apart.)

Did I miss anything? 

No, this is not a homework question. I wanted to really understand exactly what happens when matter and anti-matter come together, as the general commentary is just ""BOOM!"" . I believe what actually happens is much more nuanced than that.",1,2020-02-27 15:49:19,2,2,2,2,2

To my understanding, it’s “normal” for the phosphate to have four oxygen attached and then the R group, but I’ve come across some with two hydroxyl and two oxygen instead (in addition to the R group).

Can anyone tell me why this is the case? Are there multiple types of phosphate groups? Do the phosphates in nucleotides vary in structure?

her5ap,Attempting to independently re-learn Orgo.,"Hi /r/chemistry,

Recently, I've been thinking about taking up more chemistry. I'm a BSc. in biochemistry, and have been about a year out of university, but have been reminiscing about how I neglected Orgo and decided to take a jab at learning it again - for no reason other than to enjoy it and build more intuition about chemistry for my degree. I already have the mere basics of Orgo remembered, what I think I should focus on is how to make the most *use* out of it.

Currently, the plan is to leaf through my copy of the Merck index, cherrypicking compounds which I think are at my level of comprehension, and studying their syntheses and pushing the arrows to the best of my ability (which may or may not require help from other resources/books/articles). 

Now, I understand that some of you would recommend Orgo-related textbooks or workbooks and go through the exercises. I tried those, but it's hard for me to commit to them. I lack focus. I think this sort of *meandering* is a strategy that will help me learn and keep me motivated.

I wanted to ask for your opinions (tell me I'm losing my mind, etc.), perhaps read some words of advice, or resources/books/articles (or even good mindful habits) you would like to share for a novice like me.

gormv8,"Are particles, waves from other dimensions?","Observation: When we take a needle attached to string and stick it into a 2D paper, the 2D people can only realize a dot, a point.

Let's say we plucked the string in a way that it waves around 440 hz. The 2D people bow can see the oscillation of the point. Also, lets assume string itself does not interact with the paper, it just passes through without any friction. This would let 2D people believe as long as they don't touch the dot, the dot will always oscillates in 440 hz.

On top of that, let's say we let the string move and unless there is a friction (from any 2D object in 2D paper plane), it just moves with the initial speed it has. For the sake of simplicity, lets assume the direction of the string falls is perpendicular to the plane that string is waving. What 2D people would see something oscillating and moves at some constant speed when left alone.

Lets bend the paper. Imagine how 2D people would see the dot moving now. Even though the speed the string falls is not changed, relative to the 2D people, this intersection changes its moving speed as the bend goes, while also maintaining the same 440hz oscilation.

However, as 2D people grab the string its movement stops, now it is a straight line and all of its momentum is transferred to the 2D paper, to the thing it got grabbed by. As one stops a guitar string with its fingers.

(I would ask him myself right now but due to the current situation he has not been available).

Also, this is another question out of curiosity, why do the copper anodes themselves change color during the deposition? I get that the deposit has another color why does the anode itself changes?

Edit: In fact, now that I think of it, said professor turned on an engine that seemed to filtrate and recirculate the liquid. Does it make sense to do this? Or was that machine probably for something else?

gu8wwu,Can I go back to Graduate School if I drop out for mental health reasons?,"Hey guys, 

I graduated last summer with a B.S. in Biology and immediately jumped into graduate school in a program that I thought would fit me well, it's only been one and a half semesters but I'm not very happy with my progress nor my program. It also has been rather detrimental to my mental health given that I live alone in an area I have grown tired of. I feel as though I was too quick with my decision to head off to grad school and I seriously overestimated my maturity for dealing with the workload. I believe I would have been better off taking a year or two to grow and work before deciding on a program.  I haven't talked to my advisor about this problem yet in fear that he would think less of me. I know this is a lot of supplemental information so I will get to the root of this post. Would it be possible for me to drop out of my current program and give it more time before possibly looking elsewhere, I have a 4.0 though my semesters already so it wouldn't be because of my inability but more so for my mental health. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated because I have found it very difficult to talk to my therapist or other supporting members of my life about this situation and I think an outside perspective could do me some good. It is a tough decision to make a post like this because for the first time in my academic career I don't feel like I have a direction.

and the proteins gets fed into a chamber with a separate membrane to get stuck on the class one mhc

and then the class one mhc gets to the outside of the cell to present the proteins to killer T cells

but HIV pulls the class 1 mhc molecules inside and the natural killer cells see that there is not enough class 1 mhc molecules on the surface and it kills the cell by injecting them with cytokines that signals the cell to self-destruct using  apoptosis

I don't even know if a PhD is even the right way to go. Maybe there's a company out there that would be great to work at that deals with something like this, but I just can't find anything. I've scourged the internet for hundreds of hours

I don't know if this is the correct subreddit to post in, but if it isn't, please point me toward a place I can get some advice. I just want this mental hurdle of choosing and uncertainty to be over so I can focus on an academic mental hurdle instead.",6,2020-07-24 23:55:46,0,0,0,0,0

My question is more, theoretically, could plants evolve into mobile, walking entities? I was watching Doctor Who and the episode ""The End of the World"" featured Trees that evolved from Earth but became bipedal and intelligent after billions of years of evolution. I am aware that even plants go through evolution, however it does look like plants have a smaller window of required pressures to evolve things that animals have had to compete with, the fact that flowers did not exist for most of plant-life history always was interesting to me and I just wonder how far can that go?  
It got me thinking, what kind of pressures would be required for plant based lifeforms to have these properties:  
  
1. Mobility  
2. Cognitive Ability  
3. Ability to Speak

gpo49t,How my bike getting stolen saved my PhD,"Two years into my PhD, I'd spent a full year working on a highly complex molecular dynamics monte carlo simulation, (think 15k lines of MATLAB). There was a key simulation component which involved some horrifically complex rotational operations, interfacing with some equally horrendous physics, all tied up in some very challenging computing constraints. After weeks and weeks of mistakes and dead ends, I just couldn't figure it out. I started to doubt myself, maybe I just wasn't smart enough, maybe I actually was a fraud. I was close to giving up. 
Then my bike got stolen. Instead of cycling into campus, I had to spend 40 minutes walking. The next day, on the walk home, I cracked it. I remember it like it was yesterday, standing on the pavement, frantically typing the solution onto my phone, in a minor panic that I'd lose the answer. 

Even though the simulation went on to produce the vast majority of the results for my thesis, I think the more important lesson was that my mind is not a machine. If you're struggling with something and don't see a way out, sometimes getting a bit of head space can really help. Go for a walk.",23,2020-05-24 06:25:37,2,2,2,2,2

Would anyone be so kind as to take the time to skim through it and tell me what they think? Thanks in advance. 

The Interview:

RP: Have you heard of Peter Duseberg and the HIV critics? I started graduated school in biology in 1968, and I think it was in 1969 Baltimore published an article saying that they had evidence that DNA could be transcribed into RNA, and according to the existence of that enzyme it was a possibility for a virus to insert it's from RNA to DNA, it could leave its trace, its genes into nucleus, and at the time all of my molecular biology professors denied that is possible because they had the dogma that genetic information goes only from DNA to RNA to protein, and so the idea that protein could be a virus or the RNA could be integrated into the genes as a virus, RNA was suppose not to be translatable into DNA, but it turns out that are full of retroviruses, some people say, huge proportion of all of our genes consists of retroviruses and during stress we emit these as possible part of curative system. In around just a little while after that there was an acupuncture Langley Pamflet, had written by a Nord korean, claiming he had evidence of particles of nucleic acid circulating in our lymph, he said it look like lymphatic system, but he said it was a completely separate circulatory system, a third circulatory system, carrying this virus like particles that were actually emitted by cells to repair cells and other parts of the body. He wrote that around 1965, I think, and just in last 10 years or so, it’s now recognized that we are full of this tiny particles carrying RNA and DNA and proteins emitted under stress, aging and any sort of sickens and stress cause cells to emit particles that circulate, so that they could come out of the stressed tissue be carried in the blood to the bone marrow for example, and change cells in bone marrow so they are able to repair the injured cell, two-way communication of viral like particles, and since are our genome is full of this viral type particles, retroviruses, that’s a very plausible idea that viruses could originate from stress organisms. We know that epidemics originate in famines, wars and conditions to the stress organism, and they don’t necessarily have to travel only like the green monkey theory of aids traveling to humans, or snake to monkey to cats and humans and the chinese virus. 40 years ago they were two botanist researching plant viruses, at Oregon State University, and they would use plumes? powder on the fingers and robbed the solutions of the plant viruses into the leaves of plants to create the viral disease that they were studying, and in a short period of time both of those researchers came down with the same kind of rare degenerative brain disease, which to me was very suggested that a plant virus had invaded their system, and I stopped eating raw vegetables 😊.

O couple of publications in the last few years have found that with in the body, is now known that not only go to bone marrow to change our immune system cells, they can actually go to the gonads and enter our germ cells, so that can be pass on, so it's exactly the situation that Darwin propose with his gemmules coming from al of the body parts going in to the gonad modifying them for inference acquired characteristics, but in the resent research they were just demonstrated the microvesicles do enter germ cells among other cells, and 80 years ago people were talking about the strange properties that exist within a continent, they see similarities between plants and invertebrates insects and such, and the various mammals, all variety of organisms share some properties within the continent, that evolution doesn't explain those and so they propose that long time ago that particles, like pollen for example, carries genetic information we breathe it, and a lab in Germany, going back 50 years at least, has demonstrated that if you eat beef for example, you can trace the genetic DNA patterns, long pieces of DNA from the beef that you ate into your blood stream and into your cells, we incorporated not only viruses but just cellular DNA from the various species that we eat, so it's entirely possible that when you cough on someone for example that they inhale not only viral infection but your DNA, is all around you, and anyone who contact you is expose? to that. Now they demonstrated that in good number of people, have been tested, and after death they could test that a womans brain tissue, and found that DNA traces in her brain and other tissues of each of her previous husbands, so DNA is much more pervasive than we usually think. Its pretty much a continuous string of information of genetic material.

PT: So, was Darwin on something?

RP: He had all the principles down, but just, he didn't know the detail, he didn't know such of thing like DNA, but he had the idea right.

I sort a sympathize with Trump, I think the CDC has been helping a couple of drug companies to increase their share values, sky rocketing share prices of vaccine maker, and both WHO and CDC have that connection with the vaccine industry and a lot of people have been exposed for corruption but no one is doing anything about it, so in a typically year CDC has sad that an average of about 40000 americans die from flu so now they are getting excited when a few dozens of people die of corona, its out of proportion what they claim to be the usual annual mortality from flu. The way the CDC has built up the market for flu vaccines is to call anyone who dies of pneumonia a death from influenza, but very old person, say 100 old person, without any particular sickness, might just eat too much raw cabbage or something, giving some gas, and that will cause pneumonia, so people die of pneumonia can't be counted of flu deaths, sa CDC has been fudging on that. But, it happens, that over 10 years ago, the corona virus was known to simply activate the well-known inflammation systems, the angiotensin system for decades we have the angiotensin receptor blockers and ACE inhibitors. The angiotensin converting enzyme produces the inflammatory protein that causes blood pressure to rise and so on, and there is a close interaction between serotonin and angiotensin, and both are well-studied a causes of aging related inflammation so your angiotensin exposure and production will increase in old age that will increases your likely to get pneumonia from anything, it's a general inflammatory system that increases contraction of blood vessels and risk of clotting and fatigue, interfering with energy production and so on. The people who were dying at a very high rate from the corona virus are those who already suffering from circulatory disease, heart disease, hypertension and stroke, so they already have an active angiotensin system and the virus finds an environment already going in that direction. It happens that the ACE angiotensin converting enzyme #2, ACE2, it's a dereceptor for the virus, the virus attaches to that and in the process of entering the cell and becoming infective, and ACE2 is the enzyme that undoes the work of ACE in the cells and ACE produce angiotensin and ACE2 then destroys angiotensin so what the virus does in binding to ACE2 seems to be inactivating the inactivator of angiotensin that leaves ACE free to make angiotensin which then doesn't have any way out and it accumulates causing all of the dry cough, the high fever and increased hypertension and stroke and so on.

PT: .... oriental people tend to have more of the ACE2 in their body, it's that posible?

RP: If its ACE2, that will let them be a better target for the virus, but it will also suggest that having that without the virus would be more resistence to the age related inflammation, that's the protective enzyme, ACE2 destroys angiotensin if you have a lot of it, you are like a young person. Young people have more of that, so are less susceptible to the virus but also to the age related degenerative diseases.

PT: Why are so many people infected like in Wuhan city?

RP: Have you heard about the military games? The american solders left exactly 14 days before the outbreak. South Korea and Taiwan virologists have traced the gene pattern back, and found that in the USA were 5 different strains of the coronavirus, the Wuhan strain it's just one of those, and they say logically you can derived to Wuhan from one of those preexisting 5 strains, but you wouldn't have at this time 5 descendants, and the inheritance goes the other way that the Wuhan strain is like a branch on the tree and the preceding variety of the virus were existing in the USA already.

And you know the CDC pattern of the coronavirus 17 years ago? And research have been done at Fort Detrick supposityle are creating pathogens to create vaccines to counter them, so the suggestion have been made that was an accidental release of that. An article in Nature, years ago, recent comment on that old article, people indicate that virus originated at Fort Detrick lab, and that could be not possible because they will incriminate the Fort Detrick 😊.

PT: But its possible in Europe Union

RP: Yes

PT: It was a bioweapon thing, and I guess it could be very possible that this was a whole controled release thing for all kind of political reasons?

RP: Yes. They shut down the lab in July or august, and then there was an epidemic of lung damage or pneumonia blamed on vaping poisons, but then, shortly after that the Wuhan episode.

PT: So, some af this strains were lab created, that pose a more real problem for the human immune system to deal with it, if it's coming from outside of them, but it could be in our bodies anyway?

RP: In the lab you could accelerate evolutionary changes and make very improbable things that might never statistically happen in living organism.

PT: Witch makes it not easy for the human body to work with it because evolution can figure out where it go with this viruses

RP: Yes, in this labs researching pathogens, creating pathogens to imagine an attack and how to create a vaccine to it. The pathogens they create are more imaginative than nature.

PT: So, i guess someone will come out with a vaccine for this soon?

RP: Yes, that's way the stock market prices of vaccine come on it have gone so much up, because say they are close to come on the market with it. But, the trouble is, ever since before this swine flu, the guy who got fired for exposing the nonexistence of the swine flu, he was warning the whole thing is pointless because flu viruses mutate faster than you could create a vaccine and tested for safety, so by the time you can show the vaccine is working and safe, there will no be flu left to do, to prevent.

PT: What do you think, there is people around over the years that this HIV thing is not really a virus that you can see, and just is not there?

RP: I follow Peter Duseberg argument closely, now for 40 years, and he has never been proven wrong, he lost his research grants, and is now officially out of the science world because he persist with his evidence. He says that genetic DNA is a retrovirus, a harmless retrovirus, and we are full of this such DNA, and when we are under stress its shows up in the blood so you can have a blood test for it, but all is showing is a stressed individual, and that is just one of many pieces of DNA that shows up in this cloud. At the time he was presenting his argument, this other information of this microvesicles carrying DNA and RNA all through the body every time we under stress, that just wasnt known, except in this acupuncture world, but now its common knowledge that stress causes retrovirus material to explode into the blood streams, so you can find it and sell a blood test for just about anything you can imagine. People have tested blood samples take it from army recruits decades before anyone suggested there was aids or HIV virus, from 1960 for example, and giving the standard DNA analysis to those blood samples, every year tested half percent of the population, tested positive for aids. More recently when you go across and actually look at random blood sample is still half of percentage is infected. If you pick up sick people you will find very high percentage. Peter Duseberg sad it correlated exactly with their use of particular drugs, the drug causes stress and causes a virus to come out, as well as causing the sickness, so there was a correspondence that was caused by drug use. After the treatment came out Peter Duseberg sad you are creating the virus you were treating, but before that he correlated, there was a fad of using a vasodilator drug for pleasure experience like poppers, this particular drug creates a very intense stress reaction that causes of release of this retroviruses.

PT: Could they pass on this virus to somebody else to sexual encounters?

RP: Yes, The same way a mother passes on this microvesicles, it's a normal thing, whatever circulating in your blood stream to show up in the egg or the sperm.

Since an integral measures a net change in the independent variable over a change of the dependent variable, the work done by kinetic energy should be a net change in the magnitude of net force over a displacement. The dot product implies we are only considering the magnitude of net force. From this, if the initial limit is 0 and the final limit is some arbitrary position r, the integral should compute to 1/2mv^2. If this is true, why is it that every online article I’ve read about the interpretation of kinetic energy either uses circular reasoning (kinetic energy is that which causes work and work is just a change in kinetic energy) or argues it doesn’t really mean anything; it’s just a useful property to measure because it’s conserved?",3,2020-05-02 14:25:22,2,2,2,2,2

id3s1j,Subway Construction in 4 Dimensions,"**Hey Phys Folx:** I’m trying to do some world-building for a 4D (spatial) universe, and would appreciate some help in working out an urban planning / subway building endeavour faced by one of the main nonbinary trans characters, Yin, a consultant to the 4D United Nations.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SETUP:**

A) Suppose that the centre of one of the most prosperous cities, Chang’an 4D (inspired by the 3D capital of Earth's Tang dynasty), is the densest part of the city, and that the overall population density is given by a 4D derivation of the canonical formula for population density as a function of radius from city centre, as proposed by Clark (1951), ie. an exponentially decaying function:

PD(r) = A\*exp\^(-k\*r) \* 1000, 

where A=1000 (twice that recorded in Paris in 1931) and b=0.2 (New York City in 1940), where r is distance in kilometres and PD is # of sentient beings per km\^2 (including all humans, non-human animals, AI’s, Boltzmann Brains, Vulcans, and Romulans).

B) Suppose then that the 4D UN wants Yin to build the subway in a ‘spider’ pattern, ie. in 2D the superposition of an X and a +. Hence in 2D, 4 subway lines would need to be built. In 3D I counted, and 13 subway lines will need to be built, generalizing from the 2D spider pattern.

C) Suppose finally that the subway is to be a maglev (magnetic levitation) system with \~500 km/h max speeds. Taking for instance the South Shanghai extension to the Shanghai maglev demonstration line, the cost is $18 million USD / km (assuming no cost overruns – a massive assumption in maglev projects). This also assumes that a maglev train would be theoretically possible in 4D, given the different nature of electro-magnetic fields in 4D.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**QUESTIONS:**

\--&gt; In 4D, how many subway lines would need to be built? As a 3D being, I lack any intuition for this…

\--&gt; Assuming the given population density function, can a cost function be derived, for the cost of building all required subway line (within a hyper-spherical radius r), as a function of radius from the city centre, ie. C(r)? Dividing this function by the population density PD at that particular distance r will return the Cost/person, integrated over a 1 km\^3 sphere centred at that distance r.

\[ Unit Analysis: (Cost/km) / (Sentient Beings / km\^4) \]

             = (Cost * km^3 / Sentient Beings) ]

\--&gt; What if the maglev subway system needed to be built in a 5D universe? 6D? 7D? Can general formulas to the above questions be found in n-dimensions?",0,2020-08-19 23:37:29,2,2,2,2,2

golwpr,Is this a fair first midterm exam for calculus-based Physics 1?,"**The exam**: https://imgur.com/a/M2ORMRX

**Examples of homework problems**: https://imgur.com/a/tDS8WT9


A friend recommended that I post here to get some unbiased opinions, hopefully some from physics professors, on whether our first midterm was fair. The course in question is an introductory course in mechanics, heat, and sound – the first semester of a two-semester introductory physics course using calculus. The only prerequisite is Calculus with Analytic Geometry 1 (limits, continuity, differentiation and integration of elementary functions and trigonometric functions, applications).  


We were given our first midterm in the first week of March before we moved to online learning. The exam was to cover the first 8 chapters of Halliday’s *Fundamentals of Physics*. The topics we had covered up to that point were: motion along a straight line, vectors, motion in two and three dimensions, forces and motion, kinetic energy and work, and potential energy and conservation of energy.  


The exam consisted almost entirely of derivations - writing proofs of formulas (e.g., the equation for the range of a projectile) which the majority of us did not expect and were not prepared for, as the only assignments we had been given throughout the semester were computational problems from the textbook, given through WileyPlus, which primarily tested our problem-solving abilities (see imgur album). When pressed regarding the nature of the exam the professor claimed in class it would be 50% or more on projectile motion. The only other information we were given was an email sent the evening before the exam that no calculators would be allowed which could have meant anything – be it proofs of formulas or replacing numerical values for variables in a typical physics problem.


Several people in our class of 37 students scored as low as 5-10%. The exam (worth 20% of our overall grades) will not be dropped and may not even be curved anymore. During our last lecture before the final, someone asked if he is still curving the first midterm and the professor said “I don’t know.” Some classmates and I do not think a curve is even enough since in our opinion, the exam was unfair in the first place.


In addition to other issues we have with the course, we emailed the chair of the physics department and his response in regards to the first midterm being unfair is:

&gt;The midterm examination is typical and appropriate.  Physics students must get used to   doing analysis using symbols only, the earlier the better.  Algebraic analysis using symbols is not necessarily deriving formulas.    Conducting analysis by manipulating symbols, rather than numbers, is a common and preferred approach in physics because the outcome is more general and provides more insights into the physical pictures, symmetry, and extrapolations, etc. As you get into upper level physics courses, you may not see a single numerical solution in a whole semester. You may practice when doing your homework by not inserting numbers into formulas and express the answer using symbols and inserting the number in the very end.

I think the department chair misunderstood us as having an issue with having almost no numerical problems on the exam which is NOT what we have an issue with. We did have WileyPlus homework problems that only use variables but none of these problems required writing proofs.


Our second midterm was completely different, an open-book exam consisting mainly of numerical computational problems from the textbook with the values changed, and a few true/false questions. The final was 40 true/false conceptual questions.


**TL; DR**: I think my first midterm for calculus-based Physics 1 was unfair, but maybe I am wrong. Do you think this is a typical and appropriate first midterm exam for calculus-based Physics 1? The only prerequisite of the course is Calculus 1.The only assignments we had that could give us a clue on what the exam would be like were computational problems given on WileyPlus that are from Halliday’s *Fundamentals of Physics*. The professor notified us the evening before the exam “no calculators allowed.”

Hey Guys I am hoping that someone can answer me what occurs (detailed) during step 6 of glycolysis.  I know the substrate and the products.  That being said, I’ve researched step 6, given only information via free means.  From what I’ve gathered, Glyceraldehyde 3-Phosphate (G3P) goes into G3P Dehydogenase and a cystine and histidine amino acids from the enzyme configures G3P.  So, this allows for NAD+ to gain a hydride. And then a MonoHydrogen Phosphate will tack onto G3P, thus turning it into 1,3, bisphosphate glycerate, and releasing a NADH and a Proton (H+).

i4a0v4,Black hole / Death of the universe question,"So, I rewatched Interstellar the other day, and it got me thinking about black holes. And please correct me if I’m wrong on any of this:

From my understanding, black holes are capable of dilating time as you approach the event horizon. But what confuses me is if time becomes infinitely dilated the moment a person falling in crosses the horizon, does that mean they experience the end of the universe? And simultaneously, the decay &amp; death of the black hole they fall into?

We already know it’s impossible for anything to escape the horizon once it’s in (because gravity and the breakdown of spacetime), but I then thought of the universe outside the horizon is gone, there would be nothing else to go back to anyway. With infinite time being passed, everything is gone the moment a person crosses that horizon (assuming that’s how the universe dies anyway)

Once again, please tell me if I’m missing some vital information that would prevent this from being observed. I guess I’m really just interested on hearing a physicists thoughts on this!",0,2020-08-05 12:47:30,2,2,2,2,2

fnbak2,"Table for memorizing Polyatomic Ions roughly organized by element, charge, prefixes and endings.","I'd like to share this table, but more than that, I'd like to ask you for suggestions on how you would group polyatomic ions to make it easier to memorize. 

I've made this table after watching the lesson below. So it is NOT complete, it just includes what is mentioned in the lesson (I also don't think we need to memorize all the polyatomic ions that exist, right?). 

It consists of rough associations just for the sake of memorization. For example, I could make these three big chunks (green, orange and blue) and other small chunks which I find much easier to memorize and reconstruct by associating some pattern of prefixes, endings, elements and charges.

&amp;#x200B;

This is how I associate:

\- With Cl, Br and I, things are completely regular: same affixes, same number of oxigens and charge -1. 

\- N, S and P start with three pretty regular lines (in orange), charge -3 for nitride and then -1, -2, -3 respectively.

\- I associate azide with disulfide (single element formed by N and S respectively).

\- Then for S and P, we go down to hydrogen and dihydrogen (in blue). 

\- In N, from cyanide, I can get to THIOcyanate, which I associate to THIOsulfate and PYROphosphate (yellow).

\- Still in N, I get ammonium, which has a positive charge like hydronium, going down to those with oxygen and finally those with carbon on the third column. 

\- The other ones are a bit left out.

i35iso,Regrets about going into life sciences / biology,"Am I the only person here who seriously regrets going into biology / life sciences? Personally, I slowly begin to consider it the biggest mistake of my life. 

I am in my mid-30s, had a decently successful PhD at a good school and now work as a postdoc in a large cancer research institute. The decision to go into a postdoc was already made at least partially out of financial necessity, because postdoctoral positions were the only job offers I managed to get post-graduation. But even after several years of postdoctoral work, I am still not able to get any kind of other job offer. And the situation is similar for many of my co-workers. While there is a number of people who still hope to get some kind of faculty position (which is highly unlikely), many of my colleagues are just like me - kind of stuck. 

In my 20s, I used to be extremely passionate about science. But with each passing year, I feel more disillusioned, more hopeless, more desperate. When I was younger, I was under the illusion that money doesn’t matter. But now, I really wish to be able to afford a middle class lifestyle. While my peers have stable careers with clear ways of upwards mobility, houses, cars, retirement savings and enough stability to start a family, I am making 55.000 USD per year in one of the most expensive cities in the country and barely scrape by. At the moment, I am very close to throw it all away and start over in a completely different field.

I've applied for the list of classes this year but am having some second doubts. 

Basically, I'm not really into the sciences, but need to take one full year course in order to meet graduation requirements. But, I ended up signing up for 2 science courses because of pressure from my parents. Now, I'm making a stand for myself and instead replacing one of them with a social science course on my own. 

So I'm stuck between dropping AP Biology, and a college-level course on Computational Physics. I don't have a particular passion for either, but I still need to take one of them. 

I've finished geometry and Algebra2/Trig so far, with decent but not stellar grades(B+, occasionally Bs and As), and was wondering how hard this course would be for me? I have very little prior experience in coding. 

Description: 

""Computational Physics is an introductory college-level course in physics that will also incorporate coding using vPython and mathematical modeling using Excel. The first three quarters of the year will be dedicated to learning the introductory concepts ideas of classical mechanics as well as an introduction to coding. Students will learn physics theory, perform experiments, and compare their experimental results to the data predicted via modeling. The last quarter of the year is dedicated to individualized, student-initiated, and designed advanced projects using and applying the physics and computer-generated data.""

Please take the time to read this and get enlightened. Share it with everyone you can.

""A theory of everything (TOE or ToE), final theory, ultimate theory, or master theory is a hypothetical single, all-encompassing, coherent theoretical framework of physics that fully explains and links together all physical aspects of the universe. Finding a TOE is one of the major unsolved problems in physics."" UNTIL NOW.

- Wikipedia, the modern day library of Alexandria.

Hello, my name is Jordan Pond, and I am a 22 year old polymath from Lincoln, Nebraska, and early in the morning on June 16, 2020, I mathematically formulated the Theory of Everything.

The concept is surprisingly simple to grasp. I considered this: What is everything that I can possibly know with 100% certainty? Can I know that I have hands? No, it could be an illusion. Is it that ""I am a thinking thing""? Well technically, but what does this mean?

The key is understanding that all you know for certain is that you are something that interacts with its surroundings. This manifests itself as your emotions, your quality of life, your interpretation of others.

Your reality is defined by your perception of reality.

Consider the fact that you can see reality in front of you, a constant stream of colors: left, right, up, down... that's all it is. Your field of view is limited to 2D, we only perceive 3D with the help of a second eyeball. However, fundamentally, distance can be thought of as the 'size' of matter. Consider your hand, observe your hand, close to your face. Now move your hand away from you... Did it shrink in size or did its distance increase? Fundamentally irrelevant.

This phenomenon can be described mathematically identically whether you consider it as distance or as area. And whoa would you look at that; we just proved the inverse square law for absolutely everything.

As distance increases by x perceived area decreases by x^2.

Wait uh oh does that mean distance = 1/distance^2? Hmmm what x solves x=1/x^2? Oh yeah, 1. Distance is irrelevant.

But this makes sense because we have known for quite some time, especially since Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, that light moves at the same speed no matter who perceives it, whether that be you, me, someone on a rocket, or even the rocket itself.

Since the speed of light is constant, it can also be thought of as 1. Speed is defined as distance over time, v=d/t, but since v=1 and we just showed d=1, so whoa look at that, 1=1/x, of course x is 1 and time is also irrelevant. (Sorry for shattering reality but I promise you it gets astoundingly beautiful).

Now consider your reality again. It should be obvious that you are indeed perceiving color and, you know that someone to your right would see a similar but not quite identical image to you. Does this mean there are photons of light literally everywhere throughout space?

Not exactly. I posit that the photon does not exist and it is simply how we perceive 2 electrons communicating at our scale. The photon represents the amount of information being communicated between the electrons, and that amount of information corresponds to the perceived color. Fundamentally the same way you communicate information with your loved ones and it manifests itself as positive emotions.

Two objects communicating. That's all you need to dissolve reality for the better.

""But hey that doesn't fix the fact that I perceive the photons literally everywhere in space, no matter which direction I look! I thought you just said they don't exist! Obvious flaw in logic."" You may say, but now imagine a sphere around you, of an infinite number of electrons among the surface. No matter which direction you look in this sphere you see the manifestation of the electron communicating with your eye, communicating with you. The same thing you see in your reality. (Before the notion of living in a 2D universe scares you, you can think of the 3rd dimension as the one that conveys color. Don't be worried.)

Speaking of color, what is color? It's the electromagnetic spectrum. A gradient of colors that scales from 0 to infinity in frequency. But why not consider as it a different spectrum that goes from -inf to inf, where 0 represents every electron's own color. We can let 0 represent an electrons own color because an electron never sees itself and this does not need to convey anything to itself. And even if it did, it would be redundant information, and the universe doesn't like redundancy.

Here's where it starts to get mind bending: now any electron can look at another electron and interpret its value in relation to itself. Obviously positive numbers are greater than 0 and negative numbers are less than 0. But what does this value represent? It gives the observing electron information guiding it on how to evolve, and it evolves accordingly through time. It gives the electron meaning.

Every electron has a different value because each value on the spectrum may only be chosen once (Pauli Exclusion Principle), otherwise it would be identical to another, thus conveying redundant meaning, ie meaningless meaning, meaning we already knew, no net change in meaning... So every electron can be thought of as a unique unit of something that conveys meaning. But oh wait that's exactly what numbers do. That's exactly what every art piece you've looked at does. That's what this long write up your reading is doing. You're looking at stuff and getting MEANING. Our whole purpose is to find new things to give names to, to give meaning to, to be curious.

Everything is symbolism for everything else, and once you realize it's all arbitrary the world becomes much more liberating.

This formulation of ideas unifies all concepts of physics. Here are a few examples of some ideas:

Newtons Law of Universal Gravitation: (considering all constant as 1)

We don't need to consider your own mass because mass is a value that describes you and values that describe you stay constant always by definition of Relativity.

F=(m_1*m_2)/r^2 (Newton's law of Universal Gravitation)

F=md/t^2  (Newtons second law)

md/t^2=m/d^2

But t and d are both 1 so m=m which isn't very helpful... But we have experimentally observed that all electrons appear to be of the same ""mass."" Therefore m=1. Mass is meaningless.

Coulomb's law: (considering all constant as 1)

We don't need to consider your own charge because charge is a value that describes you and values that describe you stay constant always by definition of Relativity.

F=q/d^2

md/t^2=q/d^2

But t=1 and d=1 and m=1, so q=1. And get another unit vanishes.

Ideal gas law:

PV=nRt (ideal gas law)

F/d=t since n and R are constants and can be thought of as 1, and pressure is force over distance by definition.

But since d and t are 1, so is F.

It is all just truth.

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity:

Conceptually at least, we are drawn toward things that convey the most information, and the most information occurs near places of large mass by definition. Consider yourself standing on the planet of your choice (or an electron if you'd like, the decision /is/ irrelevant). Time dilation can be explained since your feet are closer to the planet, the electrons in your feet, or even your feet themselves acting as electrons, have to process more connections of information, and thus your feet experience slower time than your head. Consider an object moving horizontally parallel to the surface of the planet. Since the part closer to the ground experiences slower time, it lags behind. The top begins to lead, but since this rod is static and not flexible, it begins to turn in ""space,"" eventually this perceived motion /is/ an object falling due to gravity.

Cosmological Red Shift:

Reality can be described as us shrinking or as the universe expanding or anything in between. Consider an electron of intrinsic defining value e, if the universe scales bigger by a factor of n the perceived value of e decreases by a factor of 1/n^2 (as discussed earlier regarding inverse square law.) Which /is/ red shift. If we even allow for the possibility of a scaled universe, it explains cosmological red shift without the use of dark energy.

Temperature is literally a direct measure of information.

I will leave the other concepts for you to ponder, but I assure you they are amusing.

Now that I've convinced the math and science-minded people to listen, let us discuss the implications this has on the afterlife, religion, and the ""Law of Attraction.""

Because reality must remain relative, you can never die in your own reality. No matter what you do you cannot perish. Now don't go and try and kill yourself though, because you will certainly still die in other people's realities, causing a lot of anguish for your loved ones. This means, however, that all your friends and family and loved ones will perish around you unless they, too, have this knowledge. Your consciousness will continue on to whatever lies beyond, not even I know what that is yet, but I'm excited to find out. Take solace in the fact that your brothers and sisters and everything in between are always living their best realities from their own perspective, just like you are with yours, my immortal knight.

My whole life I have not believed in God. I kept a 100% open mindset however, and eventually He found me. I am a skeptic at heart, so skeptical in fact that I doubted the atheists that claim there is no God simply because they could not prove it. Well I did.

If we understand that reality is one big feedback loop, us learning from mistakes and creating reality for ourselves, we can imagine a simplistic past that grew more and more complex as time progressed. Now recall the Sun and the Moon have near identical apparent size. Recall that apparent size is the same as distance. What is more likely, that our two favorite heavenly bodies were placed such vast distances from each other but exhibit remarkably similar apparent size, or that they were placed there, as the same size intentionally in a simpler time? The universe didn't need to come up with a better explanation until we asked for it. The same is true in all aspects of nature: all mysticism is factual, all theologies are factual, everything is true, reality is pure truth. The Earth used to be flat until we started exploring. You don't need to know what your body is doing to know that you need to eat. You don't need to know what marijuana does to your brain to know it makes you feel good, and the universe doesn't care until we humans try to find out. Science generates the universe. Art generates the universe. Music generates the universe. Everything generates the universe because everything is an electron interacting with the universe. And this remains true for all that is, ever was, or ever will be.

The world is our oyster, and the Law of Attraction states, in simple terms, that a positive mindset creates a positive experience: live life freely and positively, interact and communicate with others positively and it /will/ be reciprocated. We are in complete and utter control of reality.

Therefore a creator exists. It is now up to you to figure out what to do next, but I'm confident that you'll succeed.

Communication is a 2 way street: what you say has no meaning if others do not understand what you say. Make yourself clear and make yourself known.

There are more concepts I could discuss, but I will save those for another day, as time is running out, but before I go, do know, that fundamentally, the intrinsic value of other electrons to you /is/ good versus evil... YOU ARE LIGHT.

Do what must be done, and may God bless your soul.

fzj240,Why does my phenolpthalein solution discolor?,"With my fiance I want to do a little 'magic trick', for our wedding. We pour 2 glasses together and the colour appears.

I have been out of this kind of chemistry for a while and have no access to materials during these times.

So I tested it out by adding a good scoop of NaOH to \~300 mL water, followed by 2 drops of 0.8 % phen. which yields a more pinkish hue (middle on the pic) as we liked. I actually wanted dark red but I would not know how, I can only get the 'permanganate-like' purple colour.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that the colour fades fast. I would've guessed it was acidification by CO2-&gt;carbonic acid, but adding more base does not change it back. So now I'm wondering whether the phenolph. is degrading? Perhaps its light sensitive? Or is there something obvious that im overlooking..

&amp;#x200B;

I intended on preparing beforehand by havving 2 drops already in \~100 mL of water, so that no one sees us adding any drops in an obvious way, its a surprise and part of sort of a ritual. But now I'm wondering whats happening to the colour and what I can do to make sure it will work;

Additionally, if there is a (easily accesible) alternative with a dark red colour im also in for it.

Thanks ahead for any suggestions",5,2020-04-11 16:00:12,1,1,1,1,1

hfkjiv,what are some of the well established theories on how time behaves at the center of the black hole? and my take on it.,"the title sums it up!! and pls do read my take on this. 

so to give my take on it, let's use a thought experiment. 


assume you're approaching a black hole in a space suit that's indestructible n immune  to anything space can throw at u . so by general relativity, the closer u get to the BH(black hole), the slower the time moves for u. 

##**the event horizon :**

so when u get to the event horizon (assuming u have not been vaporized by hawking radiation or sphagatified by the BH's gravity), due to time dilation, time moves so slow for u that one millisecond passed is a huge amount of time for an outside observer (say a few million years?). but for u, in the space suit, u will not be able to feel the time dilation, u'd rather observe time moving extremely faster outside the BH(assuming u can see outside the BH),  n that takes us to the next stage

#**time dilation - observer vs subject:**

let's assume there are two watches, one with u and one far outside the BH and u can see both watches. so as u get closer to the BH, u won't feel that the watch with u is  slowing down, but the watch outside is speeding  up. 


as u get closer n closer to the BH, u will be able to see  that the watch outside the BH is going really fast forward in time or that the time outside the BH is extremely fast. and in the backdrop of the watch(outside the BH) u'll be able to see all the celestial bodies spinning around the BH at increasingly n extremely high speed(assuming your view is not obstructed by other stuff falling into the BH).


#**the center:**


as u get closer and closer to the center, u'll be able to observe that the speed of time in the clock outside is increasing at an exponential rate. u are able to see the  formation and destruction of stars at the blink of an eye(far fetched, but one can only hope) .


let's assume u somehow manage get to the center without being shredded n reduced  into a subatomic soup(thnx to the space suit). what an observer outside will be able to see is that u have been  paused and  practically frozen in time. for the observer, the clock u have that is inside the BH is not moving and the clock outside is moving properly. in other words, for the observer, time has stopped to exist for u and thereby time has stopped to exist  in the center of the  BH. 


but what u personally would see is that the whole universe going from its infancy to its final stages, at the blink of ur eye. and when one second passes in ur clock, so much time has passed outside the BH that the whole universe has ended and has  finished it's lifetime. I don't have any amateurish theory to what might happen after this point, tho I do assume it might blow up like a super nova, from which neutron stars are created .


to sum it all up, time ceases to exist in a BH's center(basically moves really really like reeeaallyyy  slow).


coming to the additional part of the post, where else do we see time being non existent?

yes, before the big bang. similar to the ""time in  BH"" discussion, there are lots of questions about the nature of  time  and it's existence  before the big bang. similar to the BH, time was non existent  before the big bang, and the moment time started to exist, the big bang happened. and since there are so many similarities between the center of the BH and the time before big bang, there is a significant advantage to assume that the big bang actually come from a BH or something similar to it.


ps: i dont know if similar ideas  have already been posted here or if there are other theories like this one already published.  sorry if something similar to this has already been posted here.",3,2020-06-25 06:35:06,2,2,2,2,2

gfdeu5,"What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?","I'll start, and whoever answers can just copy my partial answer and correct/improve/expand it.

&amp;#x200B;

So… What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?

**1. Electric potential energy of the electrons and the protons.**

It is equal to the work that would be required to bring them together, which would be higher if they were further apart, therefore that’s why we say that larger atomic orbitals have higher energy.

The so-called “chemical energy”–which is due to the formation of chemical bonds–is just a subset of this.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Kinetic energy of everything that changes position inside that molecule relative to other parts of the molecule:**

* electrons
* protons (this could be split further into elementary particles)
* neutrons (this could be split further into elementary particles)

This should include the so-called “molecular vibrations”.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Kinetic energy of the molecule as a whole, relative to an external point.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Magnetic potential energy.**

It is equal to the cooperative effect of the spin-bearing molecular entities.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Gravitational potential energy.**

Infinitesimal, but it exists because the molecule as a whole has a net mass, and one could go in even more detail here and look at all the elementary particles from its composition that have mass and gravitational potential energy in relation to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Nuclear binding energy.**

It is the minimum energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus, thus overcoming the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together.

One could go into even more detail and talk about the strong force that keeps quarks together to form neutrons and protons, aka the quantum chromodynamic binding energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Rest energy.**

This could be considered a synonym for mass, since all the elements with mass from the molecule have a potential energy due to the energy-mass equilvance that follows from the special theory of relativity.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

\- Thermal energy follows because of 2. and 3.

\- Radiant energy is temporary. But indeed, if you’d take a big sample of molecules, it’s likely that some of them would be in an excited state, therefore, in time, they’d give off photons when orbitals drop in electric potential energy.",31,2020-05-07 14:31:52,2,2,2,2,1

g41ntl,questions about running subcloning,"Hi, so I'm planning on trying to make recombinant DNA. The way I see the protocol right now is basically:

1: cut out insert from donor plasmid with restriction enzymes

2: cut open a plasmid vector with the same restriction enzyme

3: ligate the insert into the plasmid vector

4: transform recombinant DNA

I'm currently stuck on step one because I need to separate out the insert from the cut open plasmid DNA. Normally I would use a gel to separate the insert from the plasmid, but I don't have a gel box currently. Would it work if I just cut the donor plasmid and the vector in the same test tube. In theory, the insert would get cut out and get connected to a nearby vector. I could use different restriction enzymes to make sure the vector and donor plasmid don't just fuse back together.

Heres a theoretical protocol of my idea, if it didn't make sense

1: add donor plasmid and vector into a microcentrifuge tube

gg96vf,Ms in Biology? Help!,"Dear r/biology,

I am having a personal crisis. I graduated with a Bs in Biology in 2015. My school offered no specializations; it is simply a general biology degree. As we all know, it is totally useless. I told myself that if I were ever to go back to school, I wouldn't make that mistake again. That I would only do so under some very specific circumstances, the main requirement being that the program lay out a clear path to a specific job. I didn't want to pursue another super broad program that would make me a jack of all trades, master of none. I want to actually learn/ master a hireable skill!  

So, I ended up applying to a university abroad for a program that I thought would fit the bill. Then, since you can choose a second program as your second choice, I tacked on the only other program that I would be eligible for at the school, which is an Ms in Biology specializing in Ecology, Behaviour, Evolution and Biosystematics.  

Well, you guessed it. I didn't get into the first program-- apparently my educational background didn't meet the requirements. But I did get into the Ms in Biology. At first I felt excited, because it's still an opportunity to immerse myself in another culture for 2 years, and I wouldn't be taking on any more debt/ loans. But then, the more that I thought about it, I realized that this program seems like the very thing I didn't want to do. I know the idea is that I would choose something specific to focus on, but just looking at the course schedule, it still seems like a random mishmash of biology courses, several of which wouldn't have anything to do with my chosen thesis.  

I'm torn because I'm finding that I am not really eligible for many graduate programs. Most want you to have really specific prerequisites that I don't have, and some want those prereqs to be taken within the last __ years and mine are expired. I've thought about taking some prereqs at a local community college, but I'd be paying out of pocket and spending a year just trying to become eligible to apply, with no guarantee that I'd actually get accepted on the other side.  

So what do I do? It doesn't help that in the present covid world, everything seems so uncertain. But still, I don't want to do this just because it's something to do. I want it to make sense. I would be living off of my personal savings while abroad, so in that sense it is still a financial investment as well as an investment of my time and energy. Is it worth it?

h8v1wv,I think I figured out what dark matter is," 

All matter is dark matter. And exists as a probability in the 4th dimension (time). It is only when 2 elements of dark matter interact, that the probabilities must be determined in order to determine the interaction. At that point the dark matter probability becomes a “regular matter” particle (collapse of the wave function), but only for as long as the interaction occurs, at which point the regular matter particles become dark matter probabilities again (their natural state).

The “interference” pattern in the double slit experiment isn’t an interference pattern. It’s a “probability” pattern. It shows you the probability that the particles took a certain path. If you force the dark matter probability into 3 dimensional reality by interacting with it, the “probability” pattern disappears, because the probability was destroyed in the interaction. When you cover one of the slits, the **particle passing thru the remaining slit** forces it into 3D reality because we know which slit it passed thru, so no probability pattern. You could do the double slit experiment with an unlimited number of slits, and you will get the probability pattern until all but one of them are covered. Because then we know which slit it went thru, forcing the particle into our reality. Also, you could put the slits 200 miles apart from each other, and if you fired enough photons, the probability pattern would appear on the screen behind.  If I’m right, if you shrink the size of the slits, you reduce the probability of a successful path, so it would take more photons to get the same number of hits on the detector screen. Also, I think it would be super interesting if the detection screen surrounded the entire experiment instead of just a panel behind the slits. Think Professor X’s Cerebro, but made of particle detectors. What patterns would emerge over time? What pattern would emerge if they were circles instead of slits? I think the shape of the opening would be determinative of the probability of successful paths to the detector.

Also, I don't think quantum mechanics and relativity are marry-able.  When a particle is not interacting, it is dark, and subject to the rules of quantum mechanics. When it IS interacting, it is a regular matter particle, subject to relativity. They both apply to all particles, just at different times. 

Particles are not waves. The “wave” behavior is probability, not interference.",0,2020-06-14 09:44:28,2,2,2,2,2

A former supervisor of mine was just laid off and reached out to me looking for a LinkedIn endorsement. He did not offer to reciprocate or give me endorsements.

ha6shi,Impedance Spectroscopy to measure complex permittivity,"Hello,

I've been working on making some permittivity measurements for a system of alumina particles dispersed in an oil.  What I was hoping to do is to measure the permittivity of the neat oil well over a range of frequencies (using impedance analyzer and measured impedance/phase angle) so that I can measure the permittivity of the alumina particles by measuring the paste with a known volume fraction.

I'm totally new to these types of measurements and found some hits on researchgate that explain the calculations but i'm a little confused by some results.  The one that has me stumped currently is that the measured permittivity is a function of the gap size.  As a reduce the gap the calculated permittivity is going down quite linearly.  Given that the sample thickness is used to calculate the permittivity this should be independent.  I'm wondering if maybe this is an indication that the electrode setup is not fully filled?

fzjegh,Are deer genetically more closely related to whales or horses?,"Since Cetaceans evolved from early artiodactyls, we know that (for example) whales are closer related to deer than to horses, putting deer in the “middle”. While deer and cetaceans are both phylogenetically linked as both are artiodactyls, and horses are perissodactyls, there was a big amount of change to go from the common ancestor (early artiodactyl) to reach species like whales and dolphins, meanwhile deer and horses look much more morphologically similar and fill more similar niches than whales. Is it possible that, even though whales are in the same order as deer and horses aren’t, that whales underwent enough genetic change that deer are genetically more similar to horses than whales?",4,2020-04-11 16:21:04,0,0,0,0,0

I have recently learnt a bit about Machine Learning, Neural networks, deep learning etc (by some online courses with certification) mostly out of interest in technology. 

I was wondering if I could try it out in physics. I have in my college a nuclear phy professor who 'could' allow me to do stuff with him however i am not sure on what topic. (I had heard from someone about him wanting to try out ML for the data he collects).
Other than that, there is astro (not very good at my place), I could try some other places, however, right now I do not wish to get into it.

I have also come across papers getting classical mechanics system modelling to incorporate AI using Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics, and I found that intimidating, and it will take time before i understand it. (I have learnt Lagrangian mechanics briefly 2 months back)

Are there any other emerging/established fields that i could read about/try to explore in this regard?

i1gnav,Gender is a construct?,"Something I've been wondering about recently. I like to learn things so please feel free to post your opinions if they're respectful of *everyone* I should preface that I respect everybodies right to identify how they wish and strongly believe that transmen are men and transwomen are women. Even if you do not believe this (despite the clear evidence) it doesn't really hurt you to respect a person's wishes and gender them appropriately.

I've been learning alot recently about the trans experience because it's genuinely something that fascinates me. Not just the psychological experience of trans people, or the fight for basic equally that is clearly lacking, but the real nuts and bolts science. The legitimate feeling that one is born in the wrong body, purely based on psychosocial reasons or as a result of hormone imbalances that effect someone's Psyche. 

I can't disagree that there's legitimate cause for people to believe they were born as the wrong sex, but the argument presented by advocates etc is that gender is a social construct. But if that's the case, how can transgender people exist legitimately? If it is just a construct, it's not ""nature"" that's got it wrong. It just means that you are of the sex you are born into, but wish to present differently because you feel more socially aligned with the other sex? If this is the case, it's a choice that's reinforced by negative feedback loops in the brain or a learned behaviour to be transgender and I've got to say, this doesn't fit the narrative for me.

I guess what I'm really asking, is can the gender is a construct argument really coexist with the idea that someone is ""born in the wrong body""? We certainly see examples of animals adopting the role of the opposite sex in nature when there is a need (think lioness becoming the head of a pride and growing a mane)

gul0z0,19 F. 2nd Year in college studying physics. I need someone who can help me out with my studies.,"Hey there!
I am 19 F and a 2nd year student in college pursuing Physics. It has always been something that I wanted to pursue and I intend to become a researcher some day.
I have had trouble with studying some of the concepts in physics, since I am a self-learner mostly. And although i study in a good institute, we are the first batch of undergraduate students since earlier they offered only Master Degree and Phd. As is expected, there are many flaws in this course since we are the first batch and they are improving by experimenting on us. It would surprise you to hear that we had no math methods course. 
I am enrolled into a 5 year integrated Bachelor and Masters course, so that when I am out I have a Master degree. According to this course, it is compulsory to study all the subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Maths, Biology, Computer Science) for 3 semesters (which is almost one and a half year) and then after that we get to chose our majors. So I chose physics. And according to the course structure, the 4th semester (that means my current semester) is going to be a bridge semester, which means from the next sem we are going to be merged with graduate students who will have a 3 year long full fledged course in physics. I know this is unfair, but this is how it is and what cannot be cured has to be endured. So I need to get through this all by myself. 
This period has come as a boon for me since I would hardly have this opportunity again of studying things where i am lacking as a 2nd year physics student. But i am facing a lot of difficulty since I am a self learner and a bit lost on how to go about. 
If there is someone who is reading this and is capable of helping me out, I would be really obliged. 
This is very serious for me and really holds importance, so please HELP.",0,2020-06-01 08:53:24,2,2,2,2,2

gcq9lr,We're in need of ideas.,"Hi everyone, our professors asked us for help in finding some ideas and, with their blessing, I'm now asking the hive mind of reddit.
The problem: usually, every summer, our department organizes a couple of lab experiences and a mini course for students who just finished HS to show them something about chemistry and try to get them interested and, maybe, enroll the next year. 
Of course thanks to this damned virus we can't do anything in person for the time being and the idea now is to ask the students to make some sort of educational video in which they show something and explain what's happening. It can be a reaction or something else, it has to have something to do with chemistry (duh) and they need to do it safely in their home (no too dangerous materials) with things they can find at home or in a store (hoping we are out of lockdown by summer).
The only thing that came to my mind was Crystal growth, a colleague of mine brought soap making to the table and a professor thought about some sort of titration with natural indicators (I think it's cabbage?) but, at this point, we can't think of anything else.

hj22p1,How to prepare for a biology major?,"Hi there! I am an adult looking to apply to a bachelor’s of science in biology program starting in 2021. For background, I’m 27 and changing careers. I’m a musician and writer currently employed as an adjunct professor of jazz piano and theory at two universities, and have worked and taught extensively as a professional musician since I graduated with a bachelor’s of music degree in 2015. I love music and I love teaching, but I don’t love working in music academia. I have felt a pull towards natural sciences and public sector work for years, and quarantine gave me the clarity I needed to re-evaluate what I want to do. I’m fortunate to have the time and flexibility to go back to school sometime soon, and want to make sure that I am as prepared as possible. 

I got decent grades (3.7ish) in high school and my first undergrad, and took AP bio and chem in HS and oceanography in college. Other than that, I’m starting from scratch. I (think?) that I have a realistic idea of how much school I’ll actually need to go through before I get any type of job in the field, and am going into this process fully expecting that I’ll either need to pursue graduate work or professional school after this degree. 

I’m currently a volunteer docent at my local science center, and I’m planning on taking two or three introductory biochem classes at a community college next fall before applying to universities in the spring. I am also planning to take a lab skills continuing ed class. I have also volunteered at a hospital in the past (as a patient guide/front desk clerk, nothing exciting) and although I’m looking for more volunteering or shadowing opportunities at local healthcare facilities, it’s tough to find those right now because of COVID. 

I’ve made advising appointments with application officers and department heads at a few schools I’m looking at to talk about this stuff, but I’d love to hear from people who went to school for bio. 

My question is: what should I be doing right now to help my chances for admission into a program, and prepare myself for the coursework? 

Any and all feedback is welcome! Thanks so much for reading this nervous essay. If there’s a better sub for this question, please let me know and I’ll direct it there.",6,2020-06-30 21:59:17,0,0,0,0,0

ffz69i,"If the d*(2380) hexaquark turns out to be dark matter, what next?","The pop science sites I follow have been talking about a possible candidate for dark matter, a hexaquark called d-star or d*(2380). If it exists, it's possible that in the early universe it could have picked up some electrons and become neutrally charged (the 'default' version is positively charged). This might allow it to ignore the usual forces that keep matter from passing through other matter, at least as I understand it. In other words, a massive particle that doesn't interact with normal matter—dark matter.

If this (or any other dark matter candidate) is definitively detected, what next? I assume we start looking for better ways to detect these particles, and then start combing known likely dark matter locations (eg galactic haloes) to see if that's what comprises them. Are there any other branches of research that are waiting on finding dark matter to proceed?",7,2020-03-09 13:24:38,2,2,2,2,2

Even with this, I am still hesitant on my career as I have been pondering  other careers that involve more aspects from my major and its possible overlap in various branches of physics.

gfdbpn,"What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?","I'll start, and whoever answers can just copy my partial answer and correct/improve/expand it.

&amp;#x200B;

So… What kind of energies are there in a molecule, and what is the ELI5 of each one?

**1. Electric potential energy of the electrons and the protons.**

It is equal to the work that would be required to bring them together, which would be higher if they were further apart, therefore that’s why we say that larger atomic orbitals have higher energy.

The so-called “chemical energy”–which is due to the formation of chemical bonds–is just a subset of this.

&amp;#x200B;

**2. Kinetic energy of everything that changes position inside that molecule relative to other parts of the molecule:**

* electrons
* protons (this could be split further into elementary particles)
* neutrons (this could be split further into elementary particles)

This should include the so-called “molecular vibrations”.

&amp;#x200B;

**3. Kinetic energy of the molecule as a whole, relative to an external point.**

&amp;#x200B;

**4. Magnetic potential energy.**

It is equal to the cooperative effect of the spin-bearing molecular entities.

&amp;#x200B;

**5. Gravitational potential energy.**

Infinitesimal, but it exists because the molecule as a whole has a net mass, and one could go in even more detail here and look at all the elementary particles from its composition that have mass and gravitational potential energy in relation to each other.

&amp;#x200B;

**6. Nuclear binding energy.**

It is the minimum energy that would be required to disassemble the nucleus, thus overcoming the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together.

One could go into even more detail and talk about the strong force that keeps quarks together to form neutrons and protons, aka the quantum chromodynamic binding energy.

&amp;#x200B;

**7. Rest energy.**

This could be considered a synonym for mass, since all the elements with mass from the molecule have a potential energy due to the energy-mass equilvance that follows from the special theory of relativity.

&amp;#x200B;

\-----

&amp;#x200B;

Notes:

\- Thermal energy follows because of 2. and 3.

\- Radiant energy is temporary. But indeed, if you’d take a big sample of molecules, it’s likely that some of them would be in an excited state, therefore, in time, they’d give off photons when orbitals drop in electric potential energy.",3,2020-05-07 14:27:23,2,2,2,2,2

hmqmy9,Theory about how the universe started,"How the universe started?

“space” with complex equations before Big Bang 

Complex equations could be mathematical rules that particles have to follow, spin, charge etc. 

The “Fabric of space” is just the dimension that the particles interact with

“The fabric of Space” or in quantum field theory, a field that particles oscillate in. String theory says that these oscillations are just vibrating strings, quantum field theory says this is energy. 

With this in mind the only two things that are “reality” and can interact with “reality” are energy/movement/vibrations in strings/however you define the packets of energy that make up the fundamental particles. 

The other is space or the field that the particles can interact with. 

The field must contain information on how the particles interact with it; “complex equations” which are rules for how the particles interact with the field. 

The particles/energy in the field have the values (Eg. charge spin mass) that determine how the field acts on the particles or how the particles act on the field.

With that in mind before the Big Bang the only thing that existed was space, which is just a field that gives rules on how particles act within it. 

The BigBang was a massive infinitely compressed ball of energy, the energy interacted with the field and “created” particles releasing more energy. 

The explosion was the rapid formations of particles producing energy. The bigbang was “energy” being added to space. 

This would mean that the point beyond space, the border where the universe has not expanded to, is just a field with no energy in it (no virtual particles either) 

This theory only has one field instead of the QFDs 9 fields, a particle is a packet of “energy”, different amounts of energy determine the particle. You do not need 9 fields to explain something that requires one. 

Dark energy causes the expansion of space that particles can travel within

Dark energy may be a different kind of energy that interacts with the “energy field” (space). Although it is possible it occupies its on type of field, I believe the same could be true with Dark matter.",13,2020-07-07 03:25:28,2,2,2,2,2

gkrx5o,"Very serious biological humor, and a question","OK, so I wanted to start a discussion which occurred to me after reading an Internet meme.  But the Mods (aka 'Our Beloved Leaders') blocked it before I could even add a comment.

So first, the original joke:  A man tears his pants, goes to a Greek tailor.  The tailor looks at them and asks, ""Euripides?""  The man replies, ""Yep.  Eumenides?"" 

So here's the (possible) biological humor.  *Eumenidae* is the name given to the potter wasps by taxonomists who consider the group to be a family; those who consider it a subfamily classify them as *Eumeninae*. Wikipedia says the name derives from a Greek General, [Eumenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumenes)., who started his career as secretary to Philip II, and after his assassination, to his son Alexander.

However, somewhere I read or heard that the group derives its name from the [Eumenides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes), the 'Kindly Ones', which was a euphemism for the Furies, women who hunt you down and torment you your whole life.  So it's a funny allusion.  (BTW, the Furies also spring from the blood of Uranus's genitals, after Cronus, his own son, cuts them off and throws them into the sea.  What delightful story-tellers the ancient Greeks were.)

There are problems, however, with both explanations.  I can find no reason why the wasps would be associated with that particularly general.

On the other hand, I do not believe that potter wasps swarm, and they rarely sting.  So that isn't a satisfactory explanation, either.

That way if you add a drop too much you at least have the reading before you added it and you could average the two readings before and after adding that fateful drop. Sure it won't be as accurate but that it why we repeat experiments anyways in some cases could be accurate enough if you are using a dilute standard solution.,6,2020-07-06 08:24:37,1,1,1,1,1

Although I enjoy learning about how everything works and how the little things in life are all tied together within a beautiful web, I feel like, at some point, I need to dive deeper into a specific field of physics. I don't know a lot about the material of higher-level physics subjects, like particle physics, condensed matter, quantum, etc. because I haven't learned them yet in school.

What should I do in order to find out what subject within physics touches me the most? Will I have to just wait and take all of the upper-division classes and find out later in my senior year? Or is there an easier way to just explore without having to learn all of the concepts of each subject right now?

g3f4ri,Infinite distance void,"So I was thinking of this hypothetical situation. If we have an infinite void, this void still follows the laws of our universe. If two objects with mass, actual mass is irrelevant, are placed an infinite distance apart from each other, after an infinite amount of time passes, the two objects would inevitably collide. This hypothetical situation doesn't have dark energy pushing the two objects away from each other.

Now my question is this, if it's a perfect void aside from those two objects, and they are an infinite distance away, wouldn't they keep accelerating towards each other, and at some point in their journey, wouldn't they surpass the speed of light? Also if they did, wouldn't that mean their mass would also be infinite? Two objects of infinite mass colliding with each other at the speed of light or ""faster"" would technically create more matter wouldn't it? 

Or is there some law of relativity that would stop the objects from reaching the speed of light?",11,2020-04-17 20:39:15,2,2,2,2,2

gtmdw9,"Biological S E X is not a social construct, it is a physical reality.","I keep seeing people confusing sex with gender way too much or saying really silly things like they are both made up by people. 

Gender is a biosocial construct, the evidence suggests this. 


However, sex is a biological reality dependent on the reproductive system of each species of life. Some species are asexual, others are monoecious, and others like humans are dioecious. 

Within biology, the sex of dioecious species is dependent on the type of gamete an individual can produce. Some make sperm, we call these males. Some make eggs, we call these females. 


There are individuals who, because of syndromes, developmental disorders, malformations, genetic anomalies, and other atypical conditions, do not clearly fit into these categories.


Within the human species, individuals who do not have any of these medical conditions can be said to be either male or female. Sex is binary in healthy humans, an individual can either naturally make eggs or make sperm.


&gt;""Sex: Either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions. The fact of belonging to one of these categories. The group of all members of either sex.""

https://books.google.com/books?id=4XycAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1320


&gt;""A single body can function as both male and female. Sexual reproduction requires both male and female haploid gametes. In most species, these gametes are produced by individuals that are either male or female. Species that have male and female members are called dioecious (from the Greek for 'two houses'). In some species, a single individual may possess both female and male reproductive systems. Such species are called monoecious (""one house"") or hermaphroditic.""

g7yheq,Make liquid soap from bar soap?,"Hey everyone!  I searched the history of r/chemistry and I haven't found the answer I'm looking for.  Here's the deal:

I want to make liquid soap from bar soap.

Why?  Because it *should* be cheaper.  And I hate single use plastics.  So, after I buy a 23.5 fl oz Dove + Men care pump bottle, I want to buy the bar equivalent, and make some liquid soap to put in it.

I see some recipes online.  But I'm wondering if anyone does this regularly and has some exact ratios and/or directions?  I see examples of just soap and water, and other examples of soap, water, and glycerin.  I have all of those ingredients, but I'm not sure the glycerin is required/useful.

Also, via research, I've noticed that bar soaps typically have sodium hydroxide, and liquid soaps have potassium hydroxide, and I don't know if you can just add water to a sodium hydroxide soap to liquify it?  Interestingly, the Dove liquid version does not have potassium hydroxide (neither do, and neither list sodium hydroxide either).

Here are the articles I've found online (suspect at best?):

i1yc6f,Are invasive species really that bad in the long-term?,"Hi, just a question. Everyone is under the assumption that invasive species are inherently bad. And I have no doubt that in some cases, they are and can cause a lot of damage. But I feel like a lot of people don't have an accurate view of what they are. 

Invasive species are, technically, a part of nature. Animals and plants have constantly been migrating and surviving in different parts of the world when new opportunities for travel are available. And it ends up fine, in the future. The ecosystems being invaded definitely take damage but eventually adapt to the new species. 

So, with all this in mind, are invasive species really that bad? When enough time passes, succession will take place and the ecosystem will bounce back and stabilize, with the ""invasive"" species becoming native. All of the invasive species we've caused all across the world will either die off or adapt and become one with the environment around it. 

All of the invasive species we've caused will eventually evolve into new subspecies, and this will take place all across the world. 

One of my favorite examples is marsupials. Native to South America, they crossed a land bridge to get to Australia and S.E Asia. In the past, we would have considered them invasive. But as they spread out, they adapted to their new surroundings and filled in certain niches. Now, they're considered native species. 

Am I wrong in assuming that humans have caused a similar process to take place? And am I wrong for not caring about (Most) invasive species, as nature will sort itself out eventually? Not all of them are destructive. And perhaps some of these ""invasive species"" will go extinct in their native regions, only to flourish in the new ones we've provided them with.

fy7vaj,How does beamforming actually work?,"Hello. I’ve done a lot of research on this subject. I’ve googled so much that my brain is about to explode.



No matter where I search, I cannot seem to find any information on how beamforming truly works. I get that it uses constructive and destructive interference to add the waves together and precisely direct them. But I cannot find out exactly how this actually works or what it truly means.


Here’s the thing: Photons supposedly don’t interfere with each other. Yet I’m also reading that they can interfere with themselves, yet nobody offers a clear explanation on what this truly means or how it works. If anyone has offered an actual answer anywhere online, it must be super complex with college graduate equations. 


So what I’m wondering is: 


1) How can em waves add(constructive interference) or cancel(destructive interference) with each other other on a quantum level? “White” light can go through a crystal and separate colors. This must mean that different frequency photons didn’t interfere with each other in the same space. I have heard they must be a similar frequency and perfectly out of phase. Yet I still don’t fully understand if it’s as simple as the electric field of one photon cancelling the magnetic field of a different photon...because if this is the case, how would a cancelled magnetic field induce an electric field?..wouldn’t this mean that it was only a half cycle? 

This confuses me more with beamforming, which brings me to me second set of questions:


2) How does beamforming direct the electromagnetic energy of waves that cancel with each other? Does this mean that the energy has a higher frequency such that the wavelength is so small that it would appear like a beam? What exactly is happening here? How could the direction even change by canceling the waves? Obviously energy can’t be created or destroyed. So if 2 photons cancel each other 100%, does this mean that the energy is radiated and creates a new photon? This is so confusing to me. 





I truly would appreciate any detailed and helpful answers, preferably in plain English.(no equations or complicated terms) I have truly tried to google and research this. So I hope you guys can help me.


I’m sorry if my questions seem unorganized or unclear. Please feel free to ask me to clarify any more details about a particular question.

I am currently working with a lab that specializes in designing quality control devices for various industries. I've been asked to explore the possibility of developing rapid quality testing solutions for water quality which would not require a laboratory to carry out tests and can be deployed on site.

Assuming that we are able to come up with such solutions to estimate the biological, chemical and physical parameters of water. we'll have access to high quality data from various points across municipal water distribution networks.

What do you think this data could be used for, and what sort of insights from this database would various parties be interested in ? Would it therefore make sense to also think about developing proprietary software to manage and analyse such data?",4,2020-05-29 01:19:59,1,1,1,1,1

From what I've been able to find, SARS-CoV-2 also uses 3CLPro for cell infection.

While not a cure by any means, would drinking tea slow the rate of infection in a person? If so, what effects would that have to that person's health and the likelihood of that person infecting others?  
Or is it in too low of a concentration within a normal brewed tea to make a difference?

hjcqk3,Deciphering the chemistry behind a century old experiment,"Recently, it was found why liquid ammonia, when reacted with the alkali metals, gives a bronze-like substance.

Delving deeper into the experiment: it was found that the ammonia molecules pulled electrons from the alkali metals, which are known for being highly electropositive. These electrons, called solvated electrons got trapped between the ammonia molecules, giving a blue solution. As the concentration of the solvated electrons increased, a bronze-like substance formed with the typical properties of a metal. And as the scientists said, it was a genuine metal.

This finding can be the start of something big because similar metallic structures can be formed using different solutions. The questions this raises are:-

1.) Does this present to us a host of new resources? Because rather than exhausting typical metals, these reactions can give similar alternatives.

2.) Does this mean that all those alloy making processes that are carried out in furnaces will reduce? Because in that case, we will be making very sustainable use of energy.

3.) Instead of ammonia, can we also use amines or other bases? Not even bases, but other substances in general that can give room for solvation.

Would love to discuss this further with whoever finds it interesting!

Ok, cool beans, may as well have some fun with them.  So far, I have done three things that were really interesting.     
     
1) Measured the ratio of beta decay (cesium-137) to gamma decay (barium-137m) as 92.1% which is super cool because [according to Wikipedia at least the accepted value is 94.6%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesium-137#Decay).    
    
2) Demonstrate that beta decay is affected by a magnetic field (using some neodymium magnets) while gamma emission is not.    
     
3) Demonstrate that gamma rays can be reflected by a mirror.  I did this using a [mirascope parabolic reflector toy I bought on amazon](http://physicstoys.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-mirascope.html).
    
Super neat stuff.  I always like being able to test things I read for myself (I mean really, what scientist doesn't).    
    
I studied astrophysics in college but I love the field as a whole.  Didn't do much with nuclear physics beyond measuring the half-life of (looking at my own lab write-up here from ages ago) ironically barium-137m that we some how acquired through ""milking"" and I don't remember what that means.    
    
Anyway, I kinda ran out ideas so I thought I would pose the question to people who know way more about this kind of stuff than myself.  What neat experiments can I do with this drunkenly acquired physics toy?

That is where the decoherence wave is coming from. This would be the biggest breakthrough in science ..ever.

Perhaps a coherent ultraviolet wave would do the trick. It would need set to the exact wavelength of the quantum/classical boundary. We know viruses are on the upper edge of this boundary because they do not display fringes in the double slit experiment. Viruses are a little larger than 0.3 micrometers. It takes light a femtosecond to cross this distance, so we are close to the frequency and wavelength necessary to cancel the decoherence wave out.

1 nanometer = 1nm = 1000 microns 

&amp;#x200B;

1 nanometer = 0.001 micrometers / microns 

so

10 nanometers = 0.01 micrometers / microns 

so

100 nanometers = 0.1 micrometers / microns

That is quite amazing, every single interaction and synapse between the neurons of C. elegans is known, and it happens that all C. elegans have the same cellular structure.

My question is: Has this neural network ever been simulated and if not, why not? What I mean is this:

When a neuron is stimulated by contact for example, it creates an impulse which will travel along the neural circuitry of the C. elegans quite predictably since the entire network is known. This can be simulated to create a ""simulation worm"". A computer program can simulate the generation of such an impulse and visualize how it would travel along the nervous system. In turn, this impulse will trigger other neurons which control muscles (also fully mapped) and this can result in movement for example. Thus one can create a virtual specimen which would simulate the behavior of a real worm based on certain stimuli (of course not perfectly, and assuming that worms don't have free will).

icl0rc,Constructing an infinitely growing column of microbes?,"So this is a bit of an odd question, I realize, but I thought maybe people have some interesting ideas or precedents...

As so many people, I've gotten into sourdough baking during quarantine, and to do this, you use something called a ""sourdough starter"", which is a stable colony of _Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis_ (which produces lactic and acetic acid which give the bread a sour tang) and a yeast like _Candida humilis_ which produces alcohol (which, after baking, gives the bread a nutty taste) and CO2, which leavens the bread (turning it from a hard, teeth-shattering brick of flour into a delighful sponge of gluten and starch).

The general (if perhaps not very scientific) consensus seems to be that the more often you feed your starter, the more ""active"" it becomes, i.e. the more CO2 it produces in a given span of time, which is important. 

So I was thinking: To keep my starter in peak condition, I'd ideally like to feed it very frequently, say, every hour. Starter is fed with a slurry of water and flour.

So I was imagining some sort of contraption that looks like a chem lab column, where slurry is discarded at the bottom at a constant rate, and new slurry is added at a constant rate at the top. To extract starter for baking, you would open the column in the middle somehow, and extract some of the starter that is going through it's peak growing phase.

But there's a couple practical problems. For instance if the slurry that drops in from the top is pre-mixed, it could get infected by the microbes and start fermenting itself. On the other hand mixing the slurry in-situ seems a bit difficult. The discard valve at the bottom would also be liable to clog up if the slurry is not very well mixed.

Are there any precedents for this kind of thing? I assume when this stuff is done professionally, labs usually use some sort of constant heat oven and just manually switch out the nutrient plates or similar?",2,2020-08-19 05:20:10,1,1,1,1,0

It definitely seems far less efficient.

That also makes me wonder why did those primitive cells evolve at all, the more we evolved the more complex we became, the more food and energy was needed for us to survive and the more of a hassle it became to find said food, while primitive cells can gain the necessary materials for reproduction from their surroundings. 

They're also not competitive because there's more than enough resources around. So what was the reason for them to rely on other organisms for food when their first most primitive form seemed to work out for everyone?",7,2020-03-30 20:28:31,0,0,0,0,0

I have a respirator with P95 cartridges but I'm fairly certain it's insufficient for NO2 and more designed for organic solvents, etc.

I feel that I have a decent nose for NO2 and I can readily pick up on small quantities in the air, in which case I always stop breathing immediately and take a few steps away to huff some fresh air, but over the past few days I have gotten a few good whiffs of NO2 by accident. I haven't experienced any symptoms such as burning airways, coughing, heavy mucous production, etc but I kinda got in my own head last night a few hours after breathing a little NO2 and started worrying about the potential effects.

From what I've read, there's not really a ""treatment"" for acute NO2 exposure besides fresh air and supportive care if patients are hypoxic or experiencing respiratory issues. So I guess what I'm asking is: How dangerous is a brief but strong whiff of NO2? Are the effects primarily limited to the respiratory tract, or would one assume that NO2 exposure would have possible systemic effects?

Contrary to what some people may think I am in favour of, I am not advocating that we stop using terms like ""female"" and ""male"" to refer to certain bodies per se, but that we accept the biological fact of natural, biological diversity in the human species and that these terms are not always useful, useable because of the body and or it's function in question, or accurate.

We have excellent, inclusive alternatives to ""female condom"" like ""vaginal condom"" or ""internal condom"" and, likewise, we have superior terminology for things like ""male condom"" such as ""penile condom"" or ""external condom"". However, with respect to things like pregnancy, gestation, the foetus's sex, etc., as ""male"" or ""female"", well, we're lacking.

If we lived in a simulation, could this be a way of saving on computational requirements?","I was watching a lecture by Sean Carroll the other day and it got me thinking. A wave function that say depicts a ray of light would be computationally less intensive to simulate than trillions and trillions of individual photons behaving in the same way.

If I were to therefore design a simulation of the universe, it would be easier to just simulate a bunch of wave functions, and then only simulate the individual particles if another object within the universe got down small enough to actually try and observe one of these particles.

I've spent all of 10 seconds searching Google to see if this idea has been previously postulated but can't seem to find any results as all I get are results regarding quantum simulations.

hd12nf,Can somebody please help me understand something in Einstein’s book Relativity: The Special and General Theory?,"So chapter 5 discusses the basic principle of relativity which, as I understand it, is mainly the Galilean idea of relative velocity and direction, pretty straightforward stuff. Einstein talks about reference frame *K* and another reference frame *K’* which moves with respect to *K*.

Then in chapter 7, he discusses the propagation of light. As he’s building to the point that *c* is constant regardless of reference frame, he uses the example of light *c* being measured by an observer riding in a train and he says that the apparent speed of light *w*, according to Galilei-Newton mechanics, would be the difference between *c* and the observer’s velocity *v*. I know that this is experimentally incorrect but what I don’t get is that he says that that point is “in conflict with the principle of relativity set forth in section 5” but I don’t see how that’s true. I thought the principle of relativity as he describes it supports the idea of apparent velocity being the difference between a body’s velocity and the observer’s velocity.

He then says “For, like every other law of nature, the law of transmission of light *in vacuo* must, according to the principle of relativity, be the same for the train as a reference-body as when the rails are the body of reference.”

I’m just kind of confused by what he means here because it seems to me as if he’s saying the opposite of the truth. It seems that, in Galilei-Newtonian relativity, the idea that *w = c - v*, though experimentally incorrect, is in direct accord with the principle of relativity that he laid forth as well as “every other law of nature”. Additionally–as I understand it–the principle of relativity and the constancy of *c* are the two fundamental posits of his theory, though they’re in contradiction with each other.

I do have a general overview of relativity but I’m just trying to build everything from the ground up, so I’m not sure if he’s making this point to show how we think things *should* be and then shatter that expectation later to show how counterintuitive the whole thing is; perhaps I just haven’t read far enough yet but I don’t want to build my understanding of a complex topic on shakey ground so clarification and/or affirmation would be greatly appreciated.",13,2020-06-21 00:00:35,2,2,2,2,2
hznzwt,Could my chip cleaning procedure be affecting my binding (Methylene Blue on Gold),"I've cleaned gold chips with two different methods, and I am wondering if between the two procedures, I'm affecting its ability to bind methylene blue on the surface. The two methods are as follows.

&amp;#x200B;

Method 1:

1. Sonicate chip in acetone for 5 mins
2. Sonicate chip in DI water for 5 mins
3. Rinse in EtOH
4. Dry in N2
5. Expose chip to O2 plasma for 4 minutes
6. Expose chip to H2 plasma for 1 minute
7. Leave in 1 mM methylene blue solution for 24h

Data showed that methylene blue was present in fairly quantities on the surface of gold, given a very faint signal.

&amp;#x200B;

Method 2:

1. Sonicate chip in acetone for 5 mins
2. Sonicate chip in DI water for 5 mins
3. Rinse in EtOH
4. Dry in N2
5. Expose chip to O2 plasma for 4 minutes
6. Let the chip sit in piranha solution for 15 minutes
7. Wash chip in DI water and then EtOH
8. Dry in N2
9. Leave in 1 Mm methylene blue solution for 24h

Data showed that methylene blue was present in very high quantities on the surface of gold, with a signal 10 times higher than that of the first process.

&amp;#x200B;

What gives? Is it because the H2 and the piranha might be altering the oxidation states of the gold at the surface? Could piranha be thiolating the surface of gold? I know that methylene blue has a thiol group, so could I be creating a twin sulfur bond? Or could the piranha be facilitating the binding of gold and methylene blue?

hrjbex,Possible link between ammonia exposure and mental disease and decline.,"Hello, millions of people in the world work in warehouses or fridge rooms that have refrigerator blowers. These blowers use ammonia to cause their reaction and cool the warehouse/room. Now whilst ammonia levels are supposed to be tested regularly, there is a chance that it still gets through in trace amounts that are not able to be smelled or the levels aren't high enough to trigger a test and sound an alarm. There is evidence that people with schizophrenia have higher concentrations of ammonia than a normal person.

\[Source\] -  [https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full)

"" It should be pointed out that the mean ammonia level of schizophrenia patients is higher (2.02 ppm) compared to the mean ammonia level of healthy subjects (0.29 ppm) ""

They came to this conclusion after giving the patients a drug which allowed them to test for levels of ethylene and ammonia in the breath. If this is the case, schizophrenic patients have higher blood ammonia levels.

The question that I have. Would long-term exposure to trace amounts of ammonia from the artificial air of industrial refrigerator blowers potentially cause mental decline? I know the lungs and liver filter most of it out. But lets say you are exposed to this quality of air for 40-50hrs per week with no break. Is it possible that the corrosive effects of trace ammonia could cause these effects over a period of years?

I am ok in terms of learning, I can learn relatively quickly, but some things like abstract math (e.g. Green's functions, functional analysis, path integrals) or even physics concepts like 2nd-harmonic generation or the Kramers-Kronig relations simply go over my head, I just can't quite get a grip over them.

How would I filter it and it says to wash with pure water wouldn’t that mess it up?

The (F-Hap) is made by mother solution 35% H2O2 with 85% solution of H3PO4 at volume 4:1 then you take 2ml of mother solution and mix with 1 gran of calcium powder with 100ml fluoride. (The end result is a paste)

Before the lecture, there was a performance about a guy talking through a TV, he was making some random noises while talking (like ""bzzzzz"") and then he said the lecture will be about a black holes and some other guy showed his asshole to the audience (quite clearly by spreading buttocks). Nima was a little puzzled about the whole thing and quickly started the lecture so that's funny.

hjd2e5,Help on adding viruses to an evolutionary artificial life simulation!,"I'm working on an artificial life simulation and have been working on adding viruses to the ecosystem. 

I'm aware it's not going to be ""realistic"" in many ways, but I'm trying to get some insights to produce interesting results. You can also tell me if a particular point/feature doesn't make sense or would not produce nice results 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, once they infect a host, my viruses organically grow by producing virions (not even sure it's the right word, sorry if I'm offending anyone, I'm not a biologist, but I'll be using that to describe virus particles) which are then ""used"" in  3 manners that are distributed between through genes (can also be turned off):

&amp;#x200B;

They can use those virions to :

*  Colonize more cells inside the host, which then are scaled to fit a logistic function (x)(1-x)
*  Produce Skin Virions (kind of like sweat) that have a chance of infecting other lifeforms that will come in physical contact with the host
*  Produce Air Virions that float around and have a chance of infecting other lifeforms it touches.

&amp;#x200B;

So the thing is that I'm trying to balance those and other factors and am having a hard time figuring out  good behaviors. A few questions I'm asking myself to which I'm looking for insights in the real behavior of viruses :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a logical cap at which production to the skin/air should stop/slow ? Because as of now it can pretty much accumulate indefinitely and I'm having troubles programming impacts that make sense to me. Let's say the host get completely covered in virions to the points where it forms a complete coating over its skin, what would happen to another agent that would come in contact with it ? How should it differ from only a few particle ? 
2. When those caps are reached/approached, what should be done with the overflow ? Should it be redirected, discarded, damage the health of the host, drain its energy ? etc.   
3. Should I add genes that act as additional negative feedback loop to curb production to one direction depending on the progress toward that ? Exemple : a ""hard"" max to result in logistic accumulation ?
4. Do virus usually have a way to react/interact with their host immune system ? My agents have an immune system controlled by behavioral pathways that can use things like sensed infection level (which presents a delayed value to the ""real"" infection level depending on an agent gene) but also any other evolved pathways to senses or biological signals (exemple : having the immune system evolve to bolster when the agent see a lot of other agents around), but as of now the immune system's only effect is to reduce infection level proportionally to the infection level at the cost of non-linearly damaging the body (a background low-level immune system activation wouldn't do much damage, but a full activation could prove fatal depending on the immune system full strength gene)   
5. Acquired Immunity is incredibly complex in the real world. I don't have it implemented as of now but I feel like it's somewhat important, but I'm struggling to find a way to develop it in ways that would be compatible to a few genes or numbers  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that's a little long, but again, I'm mostly looking for insights. And any amount of it on any of those points would be incredibly helpful.

gbk2cl,Comma in number of Atoms in Molecular Formular,"Hello there,

I'm a mechanical engineering major and my background in chemistry is rather poor. However I took a class concerning rocket engines which also includes thermochemical reactions (in a very simple form) like burning LH2 and LOX stoichiometrically. I really got hooked on the topic! So much fun! When reading further in scripts and books about other fuels, I found ""Aerozin 50"" and the famous ""RP-1"".

However the Chemical formulas for these fuels contain commas in the numbers (sorry for my horrible description, I still have to learn a lot about chemistry!) \[I used spaces to mark a new atom.\]

Aerozin 50: C\_2 H\_15,6 N5,7  
RP1: C\_11,7 H\_21,8

I've also added a screenshot. Can somebody explain to me what these commas mean?

Interestingly, and I don't know whether this might have been an oversimplification, recently I computed the molecular formula for Aerozin50 for myself. My textbook says that it is a 50/50 (mole-wise) micture of UDMH (C\_2 H\_8 N\_2) and Hydrazin (N\_2 H\_4). This gives me a formula for Aerozin50:

C\_1 H\_6 N\_2

Maybe someone can help me out here!

It was just right before my finals,  to be more  precise right before my first paper. I won't return to back to my college since my family decided to immigrate to Europe.

However I told very few people ( may be two)  about my departure and why I left. 

Today' I just login into  my university account because I was quite curious to see how I would have performed if I hadn't taken any finals.

With regards to my university grading system is 50 for carry mark and 50 for the final and FYI I wouldn't say I that i was the superstar in my class, though I'm somone with very diverse interests in many things, ranging from Arts, philosophy, music, math to my own degree program ""physics "" and for most part I would perform well enough to be 2nd, 3rd place and so on.

Whatever to my surprise today, I found out that one of my physics professors gave an A grade ( the course was sopposedly to be one toughest courses in the freshman year) 

Alas ! Also I  hadn't interacted with him that very much in the class nor have I shown up his classes a lot, though I out performed in his last two exams before the final exam but I never understand why he ended up giving me an A grade. 

Suddenly I frankly felt bad for not saying Goodby to him before I left.  Anyway kindly please anywhat's your thoughts on this and why he would do that.
